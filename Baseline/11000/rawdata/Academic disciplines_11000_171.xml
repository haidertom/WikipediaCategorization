[[File:Peripteros-Plan-Adyton-bjs.svg|thumb|right|Location of the ''adyton'' within a temple]]
[[File:Temple of Apollo, Didyma - Adyton.jpg|thumb|The ''adyton'' in the Temple of Apollo in [[Didyma]]]]
The '''''adyton''''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἄδυτον|ἄδῠτον]]|áduton|innermost sanctuary, shrine, not to be entered}}) or '''{{lang|la|adytum}}''' ([[Latin]]) was a restricted area within the [[cella]] of a [[Greek temple|Greek]] or [[Roman temple]]. The ''adyton'' was frequently a small area at the farthest end of the cella from the entrance: at [[Delphi]] it measured just {{convert|9|by|12|ft}}. The ''adyton'' often would house the [[cult image]] of the deity.

''Adyta'' were spaces reserved for oracles, priestesses, priests, or acolytes, and not for the general public. ''Adyta'' were found frequently associated with temples of [[Apollo]], as at [[Didyma]], [[Bassae]], [[Clarus]], [[Delos]], and [[Delphi]], although they were also said to have been natural phenomena (see the story of [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]). Those sites often had been dedicated to deities whose worship preceded that of Apollo and may go back to prehistoric eras, such as Delphi, but who were supplanted by the time of Classical Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert William Parke, ''The Delphic Oracle'', v. 1, p. 3. "The foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before the times of recorded history. It would be foolish to look for a clear statement of origin from any ancient authority, but one might hope for a plain account of the primitive traditions. Actually this is not what we find. The foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the ''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'', [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue to the ''Eumenides'', and [[Euripides]] in a chorus in the ''Iphigeneia in Tauris''. All three versions, instead of being simple and traditional, are already selective and tendentious. They disagree with each other basically, but have been superficially combined in the conventional version of late classical times."{{pb}}Parke goes on to say, "This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the ''Homeric Hymn'', a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The ''Homeric Hymn'', as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of [[Dodona]]: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats."{{pb}}Continuing on p. 6, "Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the [[Omphalos]], an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by [[Zeus]] who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place".{{pb}}On p. 7 he writes further, "So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. [[Themis]], who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity which Aeschylus himself recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the ''Homeric Hymn'' represents him—a northern intruder—and his arrival must have occurred in the [[Greek Dark Ages|dark interval]] between [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] and [[Classical Greece|Hellenic]] times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent."&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, the term is sometimes extended to similar spaces in other cultural contexts, as in [[Egyptian temple]]s or the Western mystery school, [[Builders of the Adytum]].

The term '''''abaton''''' ({{lang-grc|ἄβατον|ábaton|inaccessible|}}) is used in the same sense in [[Greek Orthodox]] tradition, usually of the parts of monasteries accessible only to monks or only to male visitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">{{details|topic=the general phenomenon in [[physics]]|Nutation}}

'''Astronomical nutation''' is a phenomenon which causes the orientation of the axis of [[rotation]] of a spinning [[astronomical object]] to vary over time. It is caused by the [[gravity|gravitational]] forces of other nearby bodies acting upon the spinning object. Although they are caused by the same effect operating over different timescales, astronomers usually make a distinction between ''[[axial precession|precession]]'', which is a steady long-term change in the axis of rotation, and ''nutation'', which is the combined effect of similar shorter-term variations.&lt;ref name=ESAA1992&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Seidelmann |editor-first=P. Kenneth |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |pages=99–120 |url=https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac |date=1992 |publisher=University Science Books |ISBN=0-935702-68-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of precession and nutation is the variation over time of the orientation of the [[axis of rotation]] of the [[Earth]]. This is important because the most commonly used [[frame of reference]] for measurement of the positions of astronomical objects is the Earth's [[equator]] — the so-called [[equatorial coordinate system]]. The effect of precession and nutation causes this frame of reference itself to change over time, relative to an arbitrary fixed frame.

Nutation is one of the corrections which must be applied to obtain the [[apparent place]] of an astronomical object. When calculating the position of an object, it is initially expressed relative to the ''mean equinox and equator'' — defined by the orientation of the Earth's axis at a specified date, taking into account the long-term effect of precession, but ''not'' the shorter-term effects of nutation. It is then necessary to apply a further correction to take into account the effect of nutation, after which the position relative to the ''true equinox and equator'' is obtained.

Because the dynamic motions of the planets are so well known, their nutations can be calculated to within [[arcsecond]]s over periods of many decades. There is another disturbance of the Earth's rotation called [[polar motion]] that can be estimated for only a few months into the future because it is influenced by rapidly and unpredictably varying things such as [[ocean current]]s, wind systems, and hypothesised motions in the liquid [[nickel-iron]] [[outer core|outer core of the Earth]].

==Nutation of the Earth's axis==
===Causes===
Precession and nutation are caused principally by the gravitational forces of the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]] acting upon the non-spherical [[figure of the Earth]]. Precession can be thought of as the effect of these forces when [[average]]d over a very long period of time, and has a timescale of about 26,000 years. Nutation occurs because the forces are not constant, and vary as the Earth [[orbit|revolves]] around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around the Earth.

The largest term in nutation is caused by the fact that the [[orbit of the Moon]] around the Earth is inclined at slightly over 5° to the plane of the [[ecliptic]], and the orientation of this orbital plane varies over a period of about 18.6 years. Because the Earth's equator is itself inclined at an angle of about 23.5° to the ecliptic (the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;), these effects combine to mean that the inclination of the Moon's orbit to the equator varies between about 18.4° and 28.6° over the 18.6 year period. This causes the orientation of the Earth's axis to vary over the same period, with the true position of the [[celestial pole]]s describing a small ellipse around their mean position. The maximum [[angular diameter|radius]] of this ellipse is approximately 9.2 arcseconds, a figure which is known as the ''constant of nutation''.

Smaller terms in nutation must also be added to this principal term. These are caused by the monthly motion of the Moon around the Earth and the fact that its orbit is [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]], and similar terms caused by the annual motion of the Earth around the Sun.

===Effect on position of astronomical objects===
Because nutation causes a change to the frame of reference, rather than a change in position of an observed object itself, it applies equally to all objects. Its magnitude at any point in time is usually expressed in terms of [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]], as ''nutation in longitude'' (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\psi&lt;/math&gt;) and ''nutation in obliquity'' (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;). The largest term in nutation is expressed numerically (in arcseconds) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\psi = -17.2\sin\Omega&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\epsilon = 9.2\cos\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the ecliptic longitude of the [[orbital node|ascending node]] of the Moon's orbit.

[[Spherical trigonometry]] can then be used on any given object to convert these quantities into an adjustment in the object's [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. For objects that are not close to a celestial pole, nutation in right ascension (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) and declination (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\delta&lt;/math&gt;) can be calculated approximately as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newcomb |first=Simon |date=1906 |title=A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy |publisher=Macmillan |pages=289–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\alpha = (\cos\epsilon + \sin\epsilon\sin\alpha\tan\delta)\Delta\psi - \cos\alpha\tan\delta \Delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\delta = \cos\alpha\sin\epsilon \Delta\psi + \sin\alpha \Delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Nutation was discovered by [[James Bradley]] from a series of observations of stars conducted between 1727 and 1747. These observations were originally intended to demonstrate conclusively the existence of the annual [[aberration of light]], a phenomenon that Bradley had unexpectedly discovered in 1725-6. However, there were some residual discrepancies in the stars' positions that were not explained by aberration, and Bradley suspected that they were caused by nutation taking place over the 18.6 year period of the revolution of the nodes of the Moon's orbit. This was confirmed by his 20-year series of observations, in which he discovered that the celestial pole moved in a slightly flattened ellipse of 18 by 16 arcseconds about its mean position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berry |first=Arthur |date=1898 |title=A Short History of Astronomy |publisher=John Murray |pages=265–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bradley's observations proved the existence of nutation and he intuitively understood that it was caused by the action of the Moon on the rotating Earth, it was left to later mathematicians, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], to develop a more detailed theoretical explanation of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert E.

'''Baade's Window''' is an area of the sky with relatively low amounts of [[cosmic dust|interstellar "dust"]] along the line of sight from the Earth. This area is considered an observational "window" as the normally obscured [[Galactic Center]] of the [[Milky Way]] is visible in this direction. It is named for astronomer [[Walter Baade]] who first recognized its significance.  This area corresponds to one of the brightest visible patches of the Milky Way.

==History==
Walter Baade surveyed the stars in this area in the mid-1940s using the {{convert|100|in|m|sing=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in California while searching for the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Up until this time the structure and location of the galactic center was not known with certainty.&lt;ref name="baadewindow"&gt;{{cite journal

==Significance==
Baade's Window is frequently used to study distant central [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] stars in visible and near-visible wavelengths of light. Important information on the internal geometry of the Milky Way is still being refined by measurements made through this "window". It is in the direction of the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref name="simbad"&gt;{{cite simbad
  | title=NAME Baade Window
  | accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The window is now known to be slightly "south" of the main central galaxy bulge. The window is irregular in outline and subtends about 1 degree of the sky. It is centered on the [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6522]].&lt;ref name="windowwidth"&gt;{{cite journal

Baade's Window is the largest of the six areas through which central bulge stars are visible.&lt;ref name="otherwindows"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment|OGLE]] and other observation programs have successfully detected [[extrasolar planets]] orbiting around central bulge stars in this area by the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Gravitational microlensing|gravitational microlensing]] method.

Stars observed in Baade's Window can be called BW stars, similarly giant stars can be called BW giants.

'''Baltic Summer Academy''' on [[International Humanitarian Law]] is organised every summer by [[Lithuania]]n, [[Latvia]]n and [[Estonia]]n Red Cross National Societies and [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) Regional Delegation for [[Central Europe]]. The Academy is meant for students of law, international relations and political science and military academies from the [[Baltic states]]. The tendency in recent years is that students also from other countries join the event. In addition to the participants from the Baltic states, there were students from Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary and Poland.

==Goal and objectives of the Academy==
Goal of the event is to disseminate international humanitarian law among scholars in the Baltic states.

==Objectives==
*To improve knowledge of International Humanitarian Law among participating university students.
*To encourage co-operation of professors and practitioners of the region with the Red Cross societies in the field of IHL dissemination.
*To turn public opinion to humanitarian problems and to build up visibility of humanitarian organisations on the national and regional level.

==Program==
#Lectures, case studies and discussions.
#Evening programs suggested by organisers and by participating students themselves.

==Participants==
Priority for students of law, international relations, political sciences and military academies. Also young practitioners are invited.

It served as the head office of the Board from 1826 until its demise in 1906, and as home to several learned societies.]]

During the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[industrial revolution]], Scottish [[industrial policy]] was made by the '''Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures and Improvements in Scotland''', which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen.

The Board was established in 1727, with the purpose of dispersing [[Government grant|grants]] to encourage the growth of the [[Fishing in Scotland|fishing]] and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/scottishGovernmentAfter1707.asp|title=Scottish government records after 1707|year=2006|publisher=[[The National Archives of Scotland]]|accessdate=20 November 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[state regulation]] of the linen industry was abolished in 1823, the focus of the board turned to the [[decorative arts]] and the improvement of [[fine arts]] education. The Board had established the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]] in 1760, to improve [[industrial design]], and in 1906 the Board's remaining functions were transferred to the Trustees of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] by the National Galleries of Scotland Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Edw7/6/50/enacted | title = National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906 | accessdate = 2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linen industry==
The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the 18th century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute,&lt;ref&gt;Louise Miskell and C. A.

Encouraged and subsidized by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Durie, "Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen," ''Journal of Design History,'' 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the [[British Linen Bank]] in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;C. A.

There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J.

'''Centre for Independent Social Research''' (CISR) is a nongovernmental research institute in Russia working in four main areas: Social research projects; professional development of young sociologists; the formation of professional networks in the social sciences; Sociological expertise and consultations. The CISR activities are financed mainly through Russian and international scientific funds and philanthropic organizations. Since 2001, the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] has been a key partner of CISR.&lt;ref&gt;GRANTEE PROFILE at MacArthur Foundation, http://www.macfound.org/grantees/148/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The thought of establishing an independent sociological center first arose in the late 1980s and was the idea of Viktor Voronkov and Oleg Vite,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Education Portal 'Economics, Sociology, Management' (in Russian), http://ecsocman.hse.ru/text/16133470/&lt;/ref&gt; who, at the time, were employees of the Leningrad division of the Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Sociology. Inspired by the rapid social and political changes taking place in the country, they gathered a group of enthusiasts and started conducting their own independent research projects. Edward Fomin, Elena Zdravomyslova, and Ingrid Oswald actively participated in the practical fulfillment of this idea. They all shared a desire to create a flexible, democratic research structure that would be capable of responding to the demands of a quickly changing Russian society and of promoting the integration of Russian sociologists into the international sociological community. The Center actually began working a few years before it was legally registered in 1991.&lt;ref name="Zapas"&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/nz/2006/2/no30-pr.html "Tsentr nezavisimykh sotsyologicheskikh issledovany (Centre for Independent Social Research)," Neprikosnovenny Zapas, 2006, 2(46)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the Center acquired a converted apartment office on Vasileostrovsky Island. Thanks to the active participation of Ingrid Oswald and the support of Peter Lock and other colleagues and friends of the Center, CISR quickly developed, received more and more grants from international foundations, conducted various research projects, and became a visible actor in the Russian and international sociological communities. In 2000, CISR was able to acquire new office space on Ligovsky Prospect thanks to a grant from the Ford Foundation. The next year (2001), CISR received its first institutional grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.&lt;ref name="Zapas"/&gt;

==Contribution to the Scientific Discussion==
Employees of the Center worked hard to ensure that the constructivist approach (marginal for Russia in the 1990s) and qualitative methods were included in Russian researchers’ arsenal. This was made possible by several factors: holding international methodological conferences such as “The Biographical Method of Studying Post-Socialistic Societies (1996),” carrying out educational projects focused on the popularization of qualitative methods for research among young sociologists, and publishing books detailing the results of empirical studies, including “The Construction of Ethnicity: Ethnic Communities in St. Petersburg (1998).” Continuing the tradition of researching relevant social processes, developing new approaches to social research, and integrating into the international community, CISR has organized several conferences: The Social Sciences, Racial Discourse, and Discriminatory Practices (2004); The Biographical Method in the Study of Post-Socialist Societies: 10 Years Later (2006); The Russian Field: A look from Abroad (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologists.spb.ru/SOBYTIYA.htm List of conferences on the web-site of St. Petersburg Association of Sociologists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610045113/http://www.sociologists.spb.ru/SOBYTIYA.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, CISR initiated the creation of the Convention of Independent Sociological Centers of Russia (CISC) which united around 20 research organizations. Under the direction of the Convention, the first two books of the series Qualitative Methods in Social Research were published: I. Shteinberg, T. Shanin, E. Kovalev, A. Levinson Qualitative Methods. Sociological Field Studies and a collection of articles Leave in Order to Stay: the Sociologist in the Field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soclabo.org/UserFiles/Journal/2009.01/Art_pdf/Declaration_rus.pdf "Deklaratsya konventsii nezavisimykh sotsiologicheskikh tsenrov Rossii (Declaration of Convention of Independent Sociological Centers of Russia)," Laboratorium, 2009, 1: 301–302] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415234430/http://www.soclabo.org/UserFiles/Journal/2009.01/Art_pdf/Declaration_rus.pdf |date=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center has always occupied itself with the socialization of young researchers. Since 1998, CISR has been partners with the Heinrich Boell Foundation (Moscow/Berlin) working to create a scholarship program for talented young researchers. In 2000, the German-Russian Forum and the Robert Bosch Foundation awarded CISR a commemorative medal for their “contribution to the training of young researchers.” Since 2003, CISR has organized workshops on qualitative research methods for students of the Center for Sociological Education, Institute for Sociology, Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow). In 2004 and 2005, an analogous program was opened in partnership with the upper school Osterlens Folkhogskola (Tomelilla, Sweden) for Swedish students.

==Organisational Structure==
CISR employs 22 individuals: 12 hold Ph.Ds., several others are working on their dissertations. Professional areas of research include:
* Migration, ethnicity, and nationalism 
* Borders and border communities 
* Gender studies
* Ecological sociology
* Social studies of the economy 
* Law and Society 
* Urban studies

Approximately 30 research projects are carried out every year. The researchers’ experiences serve as the basis for academic courses they teach in leading Russian and foreign institutions, including: European University at St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg State University, the Higher School of Economics (St. Petersburg), Free University of Berlin, Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Freiburg, the University of Eastern Finland, Helsinki University, Johns Hopkins University (USA), Yale University (USA), and others.

In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''computational problem''' is a [[mathematical object]] representing a collection of questions that [[computers]] might be able to solve.  For example, the problem of '''factoring'''

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', find a nontrivial prime factor of ''n''." 

is a computational problem.  Computational problems are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science.  The field of [[algorithms]] studies methods of solving computational problems efficiently.  The complementary field of [[computational complexity]] attempts to explain why certain computational problems are intractable for computers.

A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance.  For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers ''n'', and solutions are prime numbers ''p'' that describe nontrivial prime factors of ''n''.  

It is conventional to represent both instances and solutions by binary [[String (computer science)|strings]], namely elements of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using the binary encoding. (For readability, we identify numbers with their binary encodings in the examples below.)

==Types of computational problems==
A [[decision problem]] is a computational problem where the answer for every instance is either yes or no. An example of a decision problem is ''[[primality testing]]'':

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', determine if ''n'' is prime." 

A decision problem is typically represented as the set of all instances for which the answer is ''yes''. For example, primality testing can be represented as the infinite set

:''L'' = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}

In a [[search problem]], the answers can be arbitrary strings. For example, factoring is a search problem where the instances are (string representations of) positive integers and the solutions are (string representations of) collections of primes.

A search problem is represented as a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] consisting of all the instance-solution pairs, called a ''search relation''. For example, factoring can be represented as the relation

:''R'' = {(4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (8, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2), (10, 5)...}

which consist of all pairs of numbers (''n'', ''p''), where ''p'' is a nontrivial prime factor of ''n''.

A [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]] asks for the number of solutions to a given search problem. For example, a counting problem associated with factoring is

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', count the number of nontrivial prime factors of ''n''."

A counting problem can be represented by a function ''f'' from {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to the nonnegative integers. For a search relation ''R'', the counting problem associated to ''R'' is the function

:''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''(x) = |{''y'': ''R''(''x'', ''y'') }|.

An [[optimization problem]] asks for finding a "best possible" solution among the set of all possible solutions to a search problem. One example is the ''[[Maximum independent set problem|maximum independent set]]'' problem:

:"Given a graph ''G'', find an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of ''G'' of maximum size."

Optimization problems can be represented by their search relations.

In a [[function problem]] a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]], that is, it isn't just "yes" or "no". One of the most famous examples is the ''[[Travelling salesman problem|travelling salesman]]'' problem:

:"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city."

It is an [[NP-hard]] problem in [[combinatorial optimization]], important in [[operations research]] and [[theoretical computer science]].

==Promise problem==
{{Main|Promise problem}}

In [[computational complexity theory]], it is usually implicitly assumed that any string in {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; represents an instance of the computational problem in question. However, sometimes not all strings {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; represent valid instances, and one specifies a proper subset of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; as the set of "valid instances".  Computational problems of this type are called [[promise problem]]s.

The following is an example of a (decision) promise problem:

:"Given a graph ''G'', determine if every [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] in ''G'' has size at most 5, or ''G'' has an independent set of size at least 10."

Here, the valid instances are those graphs whose maximum independent set size is either at most 5 or at least 10.

Decision promise problems are usually represented as pairs of disjoint subsets (''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt;) of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The valid instances are those in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt;.
''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt; represent the instances whose answer is ''yes'' and ''no'', respectively.  

Promise problems play an important role in several areas of [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]], including [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]], and [[interactive proof system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15219">The '''[[contralateral]] organization of the [[forebrain]]''' ([[Latin]]: contra ‚against‘; latus ‚side‘, lateral ‚sided‘) is the property that the [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]s of the [[cerebrum]] and the [[thalamus]] represent mainly the contralateral side of the body. Consequently, the left side of the forebrain mostly represents the right side of the body and the right side of the brain represents mostly the left side of the body. The contralateral organization involves both, executive and sensory functions (e.g., a left-sided [[brain lesion]] may cause a right-sided [[hemiplegia]]). The contralateral organization is present in all [[vertebrates]] but in no [[invertebrate]]. According to current theories, the forebrain is twisted about the long axis of the body, so that not only the left and right sides, but also dorsal and ventral sides are interchanged (see below).

== Anatomy ==

[[File:Gray690.png|thumb|left|160px|Some afferent decussations.]]
[[File:Gray680.png|thumb|160px|Pyramidal decussations.]]
[[Anatomically]], the contralateral organization is manifested by major '''[[decussation]]s''' (latin: the [[Latin]] notation for [[10|ten]], 'deca', is an [[uppercase]] 'X') and [[Optic chiasma|chiasma]]s (after the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[uppercase]] letter 'Χ', [[Chi (letter)|chi]]). A decussation denotes a crossing of bundles of [[axonal]] fibres inside the [[central nervous system]]. As a result of such decussations, the [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent connections]] of the cerebrum to the [[basal ganglia]], the [[cerebellum]] and the [[spinal chord|spine]] are crossed, and the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] connections from the spine, the cerebellum and the [[pons]] to the thalamus are crossed.&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuys1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieuwenhuys|first1=R.|last2=Donkelaar|first2=H.J.|last3=Nicholson|first3=C.|last4=Smeets|first4=W.J.A.J.|last5=Wicht|first5=H.|title=The central nervous system of vertebrates.|date=1998|publisher=Springer|location=New York|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540560135}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, motor, [[somatosensory]], [[auditory system|auditory]], and visual primary regions in the forebrain represent predominantly the contralateral side of the body.

Two of the [[cranial nerves]] show chiasmas: the [[optic tract]] (nerve II) which originates from the eyes and inserts on the [[optic tectum]] of the [[midbrain]], and the [[trochlear nerve]] (nerve IV) which originates in the ventral midbrain and innervates one of the six muscles that rotate the eye ([[superior oblique muscle]]).

=== The contralateral organization is incomplete ===

Although the forebrain of all vertebrates shows a contralateral organization, this contralaterality is by no means complete. Some of these exceptions are worth to mention:
* [[Olfaction]] (smelling sense): Each [[Olfactory bulb|olfactory lobe]] connects to the ipsilateral centers of the frontal cerebrum.
* In [[chondrichthyans]] ([[sharks]] and [[skate (fish)|skate]]s) the thalamus does not retrieve a branch from the optic tract but only from the contralateral [[optic tectum]], so that the optic path [[decussates]] twice and the forebrain represents the ipsilateral eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luiten|first1=P.G.M.|title=Two visual pathways to the telencephalon in the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum).

* In large brains, some functions tend to be strongly [[lateralization of brain function|lateralized]]. E.g., the [[language]] regions ([[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]) are in the left side in most humans.
* Most [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] connections of the forebrain have bilateral components, especially outside the primary sensory and motor regions. As a result, a hemiplegia that is acquired at very young age can be completely compensated over time.

== Theories ==

According to current understanding, the contralateral organization is due to an '''axial twist''' (see below). A number of alternative proposals have been published earlier,&lt;ref name="Vulliemoz"&gt;{{

According to this theory, the function of the optic chiasm is to repair the retinal field image on the visual cortex. The pupil in the vertebrates’ eyes inverts the image on the retina, so that the visual periphery projects to the medial side of the retina. By the chiasmatic crossing, the visual periphery is again on the outside, if one assumes that the retinal map is faithfully maintained throughout the optic tract.

The theory has a number of weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012"&gt;{{

As a result, the retinal map show the visual periphery on the medial side. However, the central point of the theory was exactly to obtain a faithful visual map with the medial field projecting to the medial sides of the visual cortex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Twist theories ===

Two twist theories have been proposed independently, the '''axial twist theory''' by de Marc Lussanet and Jan Osse&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012" /&gt; and the '''somatic twist theory''' by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]].&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13"&gt;{{

==== Axial twist theory ====

The '''Axial Twist Theory''' was designed to explain how the pattern of contralateral organization, decussations and chiasms develops, and why this pattern is evolutionary stable.&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lussanet2015"&gt;{{

PMID=25528610|
url=https://peerj.com/preprints/432v3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary stability is truly remarkable, given that there are no known exceptions throughout the 500 million years of vertebrate evolution. According to the theory, the contralateral organization develops as follows. The early embryo is turned onto its left side, such that its left is turned to the yolk and its right is turned away from the yolk. This asymmetric orientation is compensated by asymmetric growth to regain superficial bilateral symmetry. The anterior head region turns to the left, as shown in the schema. The forebrain is not a superficial structure, but it is so intimately associated with superficial body structures that it turns along with the anterior head. These structures will later form the eyes, nostrils and mouth.

The body behind the head compensates the asymmetric body orientation in the opposite direction, by turning to the right (see schema). Due to these oppositely directed compensations of the anterior head and the rest of the body, the animal becomes twisted.

The Optic tract grows from the retina to the optic tectum, as dorsal and ventral are inverted in the anterior head region, the tracts grow at first to the ventral side to meet in the midline to form a chiasma. Since the opic tectum lies on the dorsal midbrain, each tract then continues dorsally to the contralateral optic tectum.

The heart and bowels are internal organs with no strong integration in external body structures, so there is no evolutionary pressure to make them turn also. Rather, these organs retain their original asymmetric orientation in the body.

==== Somatic twist theory ====

The idea of a somatic twist was inspired by the [[inversion (evolutionary biology)|dorsoventral inversion hypothesis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=A. Francis |title=Why are the great motor and sensory tracts of the central nervous system crossed? |journal=The Dublin Journal of Medical Science|date=1907 |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1007/BF02972358 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02972358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne78"&gt;{{

first=M.|
last=Kinsbourne|

publisher=Cambridge University Press|
location=Cambridge|
page=5|
year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was worked out by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]].&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13" /&gt;

According to the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis, an ancestral [[deuterostome]] turned on its back. As a result, vertebrates have a dorsal nervous system whereas [[protostomes]] have a ventral one. According to the somatic twist hypothesis, not the entire animal turned on its back but just the ″somatic″ part, i.e., everything behind the eyes, mouth and nostrils, including the forebrain.

==== Comparing Inversion, Somatic twist and Axial twist ====

The three theories are closely related. The '''Somatic twist''' hypothesis was proposed as an improvement to the '''Inversion''' hypothesis, and thus has a much wider explanatory power than its predecessor. It not only explains the inversion of the body but additionally the contralateral forebrain. The '''Axial twist''' theory was defined independently of the other two. In addition to the inverted body and the contralateral forebrain it explains why the heart and bowels are asymmetric. Moreover, it is the only of the three that is supported by evidence from embryological growth.&lt;ref name="lussanet2015" /&gt;

== Evolution ==

A remarkable property of the contralateral organization is that it is present in every vertebrate. Even the most distant clades [[agnathans]] possess an optic chiasm,&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuys1998" /&gt; and even the skull impressions of early vertebrates from the [[Ordovician]] show the presence of an optic chiasm:&lt;ref name="Janvier96" &gt;{{

isbn=0198540477|
year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; this idea was worked out by Kinsbourne.&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13"/&gt; 
There is molecular evidence for the inversion hypothesis in almost all groups of deuterostomes. It is not known, however, what exactly was the selective pressure that caused the inversion. Twisting and asymmetric development are well known from other deuterostomians such as [[Hemichordata]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Cephalochordata]] and [[Tunicata]]. Turning in the side or upside-down also occurs frequently in these clades.

== Developmental malformations ==

In [[holoprosencephaly]] the hemispheres of the cerebrum or part of it are not aligned on the left and right side but on the frontal and  occipital side of the skull, and usually remains very small. According to the axial twist hypothesis, this represents an extreme case of [[Yakovlevian torque]],&lt;ref name="Toga"&gt;{{

The '''Deep Bay Marine Field Station''' is a [[marine biology|marine biological]] research facility operated by [[Vancouver Island University]]'s Centre for Shellfish Research. It is located at [[Deep Bay, British Columbia]] on [[Vancouver Island]], off the waters of [[Baynes Sound]], {{convert|78|km}} north-west of the main university campus at [[Nanaimo, British Columbia]].

Facilities include a seawater tank farm, a laboratory, a demonstration shellfish farm and a combined research facility for shellfish aquaculture, marine ecology and water quality.  The culinary program of VIU uses the kitchen facilities to prepare seafood and other dishes.  The building received the first [[Green building on college campuses#LEED Certification Levels|LEED platinum rating]]

{{quote|NextGen Shellfish Hatchery

This exciting project has been funded by Western Economic Diversification Canada and has been ongoing since 2014.  Changing environmental conditions in Baynes Sound have made Shellfish Hatcheries increasingly difficult to run.  This project has brought in hatchery technologies from around the world in an attempt to see which technologies can be successfully used in British Columbia.  Within this project we are:

* Using a continuous drip algal production system to produce algae for shellfish larvae.  We are examining the energy usage from grow lights, the cost of nutrients, the amount of water used, and the amount of human resources time needed to raise a sufficient amount of algae.  We're cataloging the reliability of the system and the growth densities that can be achieved.
* We're trialling different sizes, shapes and types of tanks for raising shellfish larvae. 
* We're trialling a 'bottle upweller' system that has been successfully used in both Britain and Australia for growing high densities of oyster seed.
* We're using different techniques for controlling the pH, dissolved gas, and other water parameters important to shellfish production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.viu.ca/deep-bay-marine-field-station/industry-related-research|title=NextGen Shellfish Hatchery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additional research is being done on oyster broodstock conditioning.  This long term initiative is being carried out in partnership between VIU and the BC Shellfish Growers Association.  This project is an environmental adaption initiative to address changing water conditions in Baynes Sound and the Salish Sea in general. Ocean acidification has made it more difficult for shellfish larvae to form a shell.  This has impacted wild stocks and has impacted shellfish hatcheries ability to spawn and grow shellfish.  This project is a selective breeding initiative designed to promote shellfish lines that are naturally resistant to changing environmental conditions while still maintaining a sufficiently diverse genetic base.  We hope to develop a pool of brood stock for industry that performs well in Baynes Sound and the Salish Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.viu.ca/deepbay/pac|title=Brood Stock Conditioning Program {{!}} Deep Bay Marine Field Station {{!}} Vancouver Island University|website=research.viu.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4616">In [[physics]], the '''dissipation factor''' (DF) is a measure of loss-rate of [[energy]] of a mode of [[oscillation]] (mechanical, electrical, or electromechanical) in a [[dissipative system]].  It is the reciprocal of [[quality factor]], which represents the "quality" or durability of oscillation.

==Explanation==
[[Electrical potential energy]] is dissipated in all [[dielectric]] materials, usually in the form of [[heat]].  In a [[capacitor]] made of a dielectric placed between conductors, the typical [[lumped element model]] includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) as shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/physics/electromagnetism/electrostatics/Capacitors/Applications/BasicConsiderations/BasicConsiderations.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822191220/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/physics/electromagnetism/electrostatics/Capacitors/Applications/BasicConsiderations/BasicConsiderations.htm |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESR represents losses in the capacitor.  In a good capacitor the ESR is very small, and in a poor capacitor the ESR is large. However, ESR is sometimes a minimum value to be required.  Note that the ESR is ''not'' simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an [[ohmmeter]].  The ESR is a derived quantity with physical origins in both the dielectric's conduction electrons and dipole relaxation phenomena.  In dielectric only one of either the conduction electrons or the dipole relaxation typically dominates loss.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ramo, J.R. Whinnery, and T. Van Duzer, ''Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics'', 3rd ed., (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1994).  {{ISBN|0-471-58551-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then

&lt;math&gt; \text{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon \omega^2 C} &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the dielectric's bulk [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]],
: &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the AC current ''i'',
: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the lossless [[permittivity]] of the dielectric, and
: &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the lossless capacitance.

[[Image:Loss tangent phasors 1.svg|frame|A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis.]]

If the capacitor is used in an [[alternating current|AC]] circuit, the dissipation factor due to the non-ideal capacitor is expressed as the ratio of the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] power loss in the ESR to the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] power oscillating in the capacitor, or

&lt;math&gt; \text{DF} = \frac {i^2 \text{ESR}} {i^2 |X_{c}|} = \omega C \cdot \text{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon \omega} = \frac{1}{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a [[Complex number|complex]] plane, known as [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]], a capacitor's dissipation factor is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the adjacent diagram.  This gives rise to the parameter known as the [[loss tangent]] tan ''δ'' where

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{Q}=\tan\delta = \frac{\text{ESR}}{\left|X_c\right|} = \text{DF} &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, ''ESR'' can be derived from frequency at which loss tangent was determined and capacitance

&lt;math&gt; \text{ESR} = \tan\delta\cdot\frac {1} {2\pi f C} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the ''DF'' in a good capacitor is usually small, ''δ'' ~ ''DF'', and ''DF'' is often expressed as a percentage.

''DF'' approximates to the [[power factor]] when &lt;math&gt;\text{ESR}&lt;/math&gt; is far less than &lt;math&gt;X_c&lt;/math&gt;, which is usually the case.

''DF'' will vary depending on the dielectric material and the frequency of the electrical signals.  In low [[dielectric constant]] ([[low-κ dielectric|low-κ]]), temperature compensating ceramics, ''DF'' of 0.1% to 0.2% is typical.  In high dielectric constant ceramics, ''DF'' can be 1% to 2%.  However, lower ''DF'' is usually an indication of quality capacitors when comparing similar dielectric material.

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

==Academic background==
[[File:Bhaktisiddhanta.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in his 50s sitting with a pen in hand and pensively looking forward|[[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] (1874-1937), the subject of Sardella's monograph.]]
Ferdinando Sardella studied at the [[University of Gothenburg]], and graduated with [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Bachelor of Theology|B.Th.]] degrees. Following his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in theology with the history of religions as his major subject,&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/people/ferdinando-sardella|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Uppsala&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella|url=https://uppsala.academia.edu/FerdinandoSardella|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sardella obtained a [[Ph.D.]] degree in 2010 at his alma mater on [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]], a prominent [[Bengali people|Bengali]] proponent of the ''bhakti'' tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaisnavism]] in the 20th century and founder of a movement called the [[Gaudiya Math]].&lt;ref name=Gothenburg&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella, Senior lecturer, History of Religions|url=http://lir.gu.se/english/staff/teachers-and-researchers/ferdinando-sardella/|work=University of Gothenburg|accessdate=16 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224359/http://lir.gu.se/english/staff/teachers-and-researchers/ferdinando-sardella/|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring the Gaudiya Vaisnava bhakti school along with its philosophy and practice as taught by Bhaktisiddhanta, Sardella showed it to be a personalistic current that challenged the predominantly [[monism|monistic]] perception of Hinduism in the West. Hitherto relatively unknown, this strand of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] ''bhakti'' later on gained global spread in the form of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], or the [[Hare Krishna movement]], inspired by Bhaktisiddhanta's teachings.&lt;ref name=Gothenburg/&gt; In 2010 the [[Donner Institute]], attached to [[Abo Akademi University]], gave Sardella's dissertation their first newly established award  for "outstanding research into religion".&lt;ref name=Gothenburg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donner institute|url=http://www.abo.fi/forskning/donnerska_institutet|work=Åbo Akademi University|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboAward"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abo.fi/forskning/di_priset|title = The DI Prize for Outstanding Research into Religion|accessdate = 19 January 2014|website = Abo Akademi University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the dissertation was published by [[Oxford University Press]] as a monograph that  [[Gavin Flood]] in his review called "a significant contribution to scholarship not only of the modern Gaudiya Vaisnava movement but also of the religious history of Bengal within the last half of the colonial period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flood|first=Gavin|title=Modern Hindu Personalism  The History, Life, and Thought of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati|url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/modern-hindu-personalism-9780199865901?cc=se&amp;lang=en&amp;tab=reviews|work=Oxford University Press, USA|accessdate=20 January 2014|authorlink=Gavin Flood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fish''' are [[gill]]-bearing [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[craniate]] animals that lack [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] with [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]]. They form a sister group to the [[tunicate]]s, together forming the [[Chordate|olfactores]]. Included in this definition are the living [[hagfish]], [[lamprey]]s, and [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]] as well as various extinct related groups. [[Tetrapod]]s emerged within [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fishes]], so [[Cladistics|cladistically]] they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered [[paraphyletic]] by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in [[systematics|systematic biology]], unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/choagstrom/Zoology1120CH10.pdf|title=Zoology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Harry W.|date=1998-01-01|title=We are primates and we are fish: Teaching monophyletic organismal biology|journal=Integrative Biology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=108–111|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6602(1998)1:3&lt;108::aid-inbi5&gt;3.0.co;2-t|issn=1520-6602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional term '''pisces''' (also '''ichthyes''') is considered a [[wikt:typology|typological]], but not a [[phylogenetic]] classification.

The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied [[chordate]]s that first appeared during the [[Cambrian]] period. Although they lacked a [[vertebrate|true spine]], they possessed [[notochord]]s which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the [[Paleozoic]] era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed [[placodermi|external armor]] that protected them from predators. The first fish with [[jaw]]s appeared in the [[Silurian]] period, after which many (such as [[shark]]s) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of [[arthropod]]s.

Most fish are [[ectotherm]]ic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like [[white shark]] and [[tuna]] can hold a higher [[core temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=K.J. |title=Regulation of body temperature in the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'' |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1997 |volume=167 |series=B Biochemical Systemic and Environmental Physiology |issue=6 |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1007/s003600050092 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114844/http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carey |first=F.G. |author2=Lawson, K.D. |title=Temperature regulation in free-swimming bluefin tuna |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |date=February 1973 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=375–392 |doi=10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bioacoustics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinmann|first1=S.

They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertucci|first1=F.|last2=Ruppé|first2=L.|last3=Wassenbergh|first3=S.

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., [[Salvelinus|char]] and [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]) to the [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] and even [[hadal zone|hadal]] depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., [[gulper]]s and [[anglerfish]]), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[FishBase]] |url=http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |title=FishBase |date=August 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823230232/http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |archivedate=23 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3970477 | pmid=24591588 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1322003111 | volume=111 | issue=12 | title=Marine fish may be biochemically constrained from inhabiting the deepest ocean depths | year=2014 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=4461–5 | last1 = Yancey | first1 = PH | last2 = Gerringer | first2 = ME | last3 = Drazen | first3 = JC | last4 = Rowden | first4 = AA | last5 = Jamieson | first5 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially [[fish (food)|as food]]. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in [[wild fisheries]] (see fishing) or [[Fish farm|farm]] them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see [[aquaculture]]). They are also caught by [[Recreational fishing|recreational fishers]], kept as pets, raised by [[Fishkeeping|fishkeepers]], and exhibited in public [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as [[deity|deities]], religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of fish}}
[[File:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|thumb|''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' was a gigantic, {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} long [[prehistoric fish]] of class Placodermi.|alt=Drawing of animal with large mouth, long tail, very small dorsal fins, and pectoral fins that attach towards the bottom of the body, resembling lizard legs in scale and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |title=Monster fish crushed opposition with strongest bite ever |publisher=[[Smh.com.au]] |date=30 November 2006 |accessdate=26 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402143409/http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |archivedate=2 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fish do not represent a [[monophyletic]] group, and therefore the "evolution of fish" is not studied as a single event.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lecointre &amp; H. Le Guyader, 2007, ''The Tree of Life: A Phylogenetic Classification'', Harvard University Press Reference Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless, armored fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a [[Fish jaw|jawed mouth]]. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.

Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have [[Neoteny|kept the larval form into adulthood]] (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.

===Taxonomy===
Fish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the "Class Pisces" seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications.
[[File:Leedsi&amp;Liopl DB.jpg|thumb|[[Leedsichthys]] (left), of the subclass Actinopterygii, is the largest known fish, with estimates in 2005 putting its maximum size at {{convert|16|m}}.]]

Traditional classification divides fish into three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[class (biology)|classes]], and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own classes:&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S.

Pp. 269–303, in Donovan, S. K. and Paul, C. R. C. (eds), The adequacy of the fossil record, Fig. 2. Wiley, New York, 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fish)
** Subclass [[Cyclostomata]] ([[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s)
** Subclass [[Ostracodermi]] (armoured jawless fish) †
* Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]])
** Subclass [[Holocephali]] ([[chimaera]]s and extinct relatives)

** Subclass [[Actinopterygii]] (ray finned fishes)
** Subclass [[Sarcopterygii]] (fleshy finned fishes, ancestors of tetrapods)

The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and general works. Many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they have given rise to successive groups: Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes, who again have given rise to Acanthodiians, the ancestors of Osteichthyes. With the arrival of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme, with the following major groups:
* Class Myxini ([[hagfish]])
* Class [[Pteraspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
* Class [[Thelodonti]] †
* Class [[Anaspida]] †
* Class [[Hyperoartia|Petromyzontida or Hyperoartia]]

† – indicates extinct taxon&lt;br /&gt;Some palaeontologists contend that because [[Conodonta]] are [[chordate]]s, they are primitive fish. For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy, see the [[vertebrate]] article.

The position of [[hagfish]] in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the [[Cyclostomata]], that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.&lt;ref&gt;Shigehiro Kuraku, Daisuke Hoshiyama, Kazutaka Katoh, Hiroshi Suga, Takashi Miyata (1999) ''Monophyly of Lampreys and Hagfishes Supported by Nuclear DNA–Coded Genes'' J Mol Evol (1999) 49:729–735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mallatt, J. Sullivan (1998) ''28S and 18S rDNA sequences support the monophyly of lampreys and hagfishes'' Molecular Biology and Evolution V 15, Issue 12, pp 1706–1718&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species. There are almost 28,000 known [[extant taxon|extant]] species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 [[Chondrichthyes|sharks, rays, and chimeras]] and about 108 hagfish and lampreys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are [[Cyprinidae]], [[Gobiidae]], [[Cichlidae]], [[Characidae]], [[Loricariidae]], [[Balitoridae]], [[Serranidae]], [[Labridae]], and [[Scorpaenidae]]. About 64 families are [[monotypic]], containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fish" most precisely describes any non-[[tetrapod]] [[craniate]] (i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has [[gill]]s throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike groupings such as birds or [[mammal]]s, fish are not a single [[clade]] but a [[paraphyletic]] collection of [[taxon|taxa]], including [[hagfish]]es, [[lamprey]]s, [[Chondrichthyes|sharks and rays]], [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[coelacanth]]s, and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name="publishing3"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treeoflife&gt;Tree of life web project – [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 Chordates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224172716/http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 |date=24 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of [[tetrapod]]s (such as [[mammal]]s, birds, [[Lissamphibia|amphibians]], etc.) than of other fish such as [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] or sharks, so the [[last common ancestor]] of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern [[systematics|systematic biology]], the use of the term "fish" as a biological group must be avoided.

Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s commonly referred to as "fish" are not fish in the sense given above; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seals]], whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name="integrated"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cleveland P. Hickman, Jr. |author2=Larry S. Roberts |author3=Allan L. Larson |title=Integrated Principles of Zoology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Co |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-07-290961-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the definition above, all mammals, including [[cetacean]]s like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In some contexts, especially in [[aquaculture]], the true fish are referred to as '''finfish''' (or '''fin fish''') to distinguish them from these other animals.

[[File:leafydragon.jpg|thumb|A relative of the seahorses, the [[leafy seadragon]]'s appendages allow it to camouflage (in the form of [[crypsis]]) with the surrounding [[seaweed]].|alt=Photo of fish with many narrow, straight appendages. Some are end in points, and others are longer, ending in two or three approximately flat, triangular flaps, each with a dark spot.]]

A typical fish is [[ectothermic]], has a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamlined]] body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with [[scale (zoology)|scales]], and lays eggs.

Each criterion has exceptions. [[Tuna]], [[swordfish]], and some species of [[shark]]s show [[Warm-blooded#Temperature control in cold-blooded animals|some warm-blooded adaptations]]—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature.&lt;ref name="publishing3"/&gt; Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as [[tuna]], [[salmon]], and [[Carangidae|jacks]] that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to species such as [[eel]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]] that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. [[Lungfish]] have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, [[gourami]]s have a structure called the [[labyrinth organ]] that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=53–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as [[seahorse]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[anglerfish]], and [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulpers]]. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in [[moray eel]]s), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as [[Placoid scale|placoid]] (typical of sharks and rays), [[Scale (zoology)#Cosmoid scales|cosmoid]] (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), [[ganoid]] (various fossil fish but also living [[gar]]s and [[bichir]]s), [[Fish scale#Leptoid scales|cycloid]], and [[ctenoid]] (these last two are found on most [[bony fish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin, K.L.M. |title=Beach-Spawning Fishes: Reproduction in an Endangered Ecosystem |year=2014 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1482207972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mudskipper]]s feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Periophthalmus|species=barbarus|year=2006|month=November|id=12803}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single, [[undescribed species]] of ''[[Phreatobius]]'', has been called a true "land fish" as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged [[leaf litter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/species.php?species_id=646 |title=Cat-eLog: Heptapteridae: ''Phreatobius'': ''Phreatobius'' sp.

Fish range in size from the huge {{convert|16|m|adj=on}} [[whale shark]] to the tiny {{convert|8|mm|1|adj=on}} [[stout infantfish]].

Fish [[species]] diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and [[freshwater]] ecosystems. [[Coral reef]]s in the [[Indo-Pacific]] constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large [[river basin]]s of [[tropical rainforest]]s, especially the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], [[Congo Basin|Congo]], and [[Mekong]] basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit [[Neotropic]]al freshwaters alone, such that [[Neotropical fish]]es represent about 10% of all [[vertebrate]] species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as [[Cantão State Park]], can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 Estudo das Espécies Ícticas do Parque Estadual do Cantão] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160450/http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 |date=6 July 2011 }}, fish species survey of Cantão (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiration===
{{See also|Aquatic respiration}}

====Gills====
Most fish exchange gases using [[gill]]s on either side of the [[pharynx]]. Gills consist of threadlike structures called [[Protein filament|filaments]]. Each filament contains a [[capillary]] network that provides a large [[surface area]] for exchanging [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[countercurrent exchange]]. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like [[shark]]s and [[lamprey]]s, possess multiple gill openings. However, [[bony fish]] have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]].

Juvenile [[bichir]]s have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval [[amphibian]]s.

====Air breathing====
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|[[Tuna]] gills inside the head. The fish head is oriented snout-downwards, with the view looking towards the mouth.|alt=Photo of fish head split in half longitudinally with gill filaments crossing from top to bottom]]
Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods. [[Amphibious fish]] such as the [[mudskipper]] can live and move about on land for up to several days,{{doubtful|date=December 2014}} or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of [[anguillidae|anguillid eels]] may absorb oxygen directly. The [[buccal cavity]] of the [[electric eel]] may breathe air. Catfish of the families [[Loricariidae]], [[Callichthyidae]], and [[Scoloplacidae]] absorb air through their digestive tracts.&lt;ref name="Armbruster1998"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |title=Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes |journal=[[Copeia]] |year=1998 |issue=3 |pages=663–675 |doi=10.2307/1447796 |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2009 |volume=1998 |last1=Armbruster |first1=Jonathan W. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326130527/http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all |jstor=1447796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lungfish]], with the exception of the [[Australian lungfish]], and [[bichir]]s have paired lungs similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. [[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. [[Cypriniformes|Loaches]], [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] catfish family.

Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and [[cichlid]]s, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of [[aestivation]] (summertime hibernation) until water returns.

Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the [[African lungfish]], ''must'' breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''[[Hypostomus plecostomus]]'', only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.&lt;ref name="Armbruster1998"/&gt;

===Circulation===
[[File:Didactic model of a fish heart--FMVZ USP-09.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a fish heart]]
Fish have a [[circulatory system|closed-loop circulatory system]]. The [[heart]] pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.&lt;ref name="Setaro"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Setaro |first=John F. |year=1999 |title=Circulatory System |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part is the [[sinus venosus]], a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the second part, the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, [[bulbus arteriosus]], a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the [[aorta]], through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.

===Digestion===
Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the [[esophagus]]. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called [[pyloric caeca]], which secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.

===Excretion===
As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills. Blood wastes are [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] by the [[kidney]]s.

Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]]: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.

===Scales===
{{Main|Fish scale}}
The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.

===Sensory and nervous system===
[[File:Fish brain.png|thumb|upright|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]]|alt=Anatomical diagram showing the pairs of olfactory, telencephalon, and optic lobes, followed by the cerebellum and the mylencephalon]]

====Central nervous system====
Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobes]], a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the structural equivalent to the [[cerebrum]] in [[amniote|higher vertebrates]]. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; Together these structures form the forebrain.

Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the [[diencephalon]] (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains [[circadian]] rhythms, and controls color changes.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The [[midbrain]] (or mesencephalon) contains the two [[Midbrain#Corpora quadrigemina|optic lobes]]. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The hindbrain (or [[metencephalon]]) is particularly involved in swimming and balance.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain" /&gt; Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellae, while the [[mormyrid]] cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The brain stem (or [[myelencephalon]]) is the brain's posterior.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

====Sense organs====
Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see [[vision in fishes]]). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]], which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.&lt;ref name="Encarta 99"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orr |first=James |year=1999 |title=Fish |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99 |isbn=978-0-8114-2346-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]], organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. pp. 431–472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fish, like the South American electric fishes [[Gymnotiformes]], can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.

Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sciences |first=Journal of Undergraduate Life |url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |title=Appropriate maze methodology to study learning in fish |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hn2YJET6?url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vision=====
{{main|Vision in fishes}}
[[Visual system|Vision]] is an important [[sensory system]] for most species of fish. Fish eyes are similar to those of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrate]]s like [[bird vision|birds]] and mammals, but have a more [[spherical]] [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. Their [[retina]]s generally have both [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] (for [[scotopic vision|scotopic]] and [[photopic vision]]), and most species have [[colour vision]]. Some fish can see [[ultraviolet]] and some can see [[polarized light]]. Amongst [[jawless fish]], the [[lamprey]] has well-developed eyes, while the [[hagfish]] has only primitive [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil A. Campbell |last2=Reece |first2=Jane B. |authorlink2=Jane Reece |year=2005 |title=''Biology'' |edition=Seventh |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish vision shows [[adaptation]] to their visual environment, for example [[deep sea fish]]es have eyes suited to the dark environment.

=====Hearing=====
{{see also|Sensory systems in fish#Hearing}}
[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish sense sound using their [[lateral line]]s and their [[otolith|ears]].

====Capacity for pain====
{{Further|Pain in fish}}
Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have [[pain]] and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, [[Batrachoididae|toadfish]] grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.&lt;ref&gt;Dunayer, Joan, "Fish: Sensitivity Beyond the Captor's Grasp," The Animals' Agenda, July/August 1991, pp. 12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Scottish scientists at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with [[pain]] in other animals. [[Bee]] [[venom]] and [[acetic acid]] injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm |title=Fish do feel pain, scientists say |work=BBC News |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |first=Alex |last=Kirby |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215121355/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grandin183"&gt;{{cite book |title=Animals in Translation |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |author2=Johnson, Catherine |year=2005 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7432-4769-6 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.&lt;ref name="grandin183"/&gt;

Professor James D. Rose of the [[University of Wyoming]]  claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess "conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/RoseC.pdf |title=Rose, J.D. 2003.

Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=James D. |url=http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/ |title=Do Fish Feel Pain? |year=2002 |accessdate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120104558/http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/ |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, animal behaviorist [[Temple Grandin]] argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because "different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions."&lt;ref name="grandin183"/&gt;

Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible [[suffering]] of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British [[RSPCA]] now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1037515,00.html |title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscular system===
{{Main|Fish locomotion}}
[[File:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|Swim bladder of a rudd (''[[Scardinius erythrophthalmus]]'')|alt=Photo of white bladder that consists of a rectangular section and a banana-shaped section connected by a much thinner element]]

Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.

====Endothermy====
Although most fish are exclusively [[ectothermic]], there are exceptions. The only known bony fishes (infraclass [[Teleostei]]) that exhibit [[Warm-blooded|endothermy]] are in the suborder [[Scombroidei]] – which includes the [[billfish]]es, tunas, and the [[butterfly kingfish]], a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] species of mackerel&lt;ref name="Block1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Block |first1=BA |last2=Finnerty |first2=JR |year=1993 |title=Endothermy in fishes: a phylogenetic analysis of constraints, predispositions, and selection pressures |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226138605 |format=PDF |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=283–302 |doi=10.1007/BF00002518}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and also the [[Lampris guttatus|opah]]. The opah, a [[lampriform]], was demonstrated in 2015 to utilize "whole-body endothermy", generating heat with its swimming muscles to warm its body while countercurrent exchange (as in respiration) minimizes heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wegner |first=Nicholas C. |last2=Snodgrass |first2=Owyn E. |last3=Dewar |first3=Heidi |last4=Hyde |first4=John R. |date=2015-05-15 |title=Whole-body endothermy in a mesopelagic fish, the opah, Lampris guttatus |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6236/786 |journal=Science |volume=348 |issue=6236 |pages=786–789 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa8902 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=25977549}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to actively hunt prey such as squid and swim for long distances due to the ability to warm its entire body, including its heart,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=39&amp;id=20466 |title=Warm Blood Makes Opah an Agile Predator |date=2015-05-12 |website=Southwest Fisheries Science Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120000911/https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=39&amp;id=20466 |archive-date=2018-01-20 |dead-url=no |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a trait typically found in only mammals and birds (in the form of [[homeothermy]]).&lt;!-- Mentioned in Wegner 2015 --&gt; In the cartilaginous fishes (class [[Chondrichthyes]]), sharks of the families [[Lamnidae]] (porbeagle, mackerel, salmon, and great white sharks) and [[Alopiidae]] (thresher sharks) exhibit endothermy. The degree of endothermy varies from the billfishes, which warm only their eyes and brain, to the [[bluefin tuna]] and the [[porbeagle shark]], which maintain body temperatures in excess of {{convert|20|C}} above ambient water temperatures.&lt;ref name="Block1993" /&gt;

Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central [[nervous system]] processing, and higher rates of [[digestion]].

===Reproductive system===
{{Further|Fish reproduction|Spawn (biology)}}

[[File:Torskens indre organer.jpg|thumb|[[Organ (anatomy)|Organs]]: 1. [[Liver]], 2. [[Gas bladder]], 3. [[Roe]], 4. Pyloric caeca, 5. [[Stomach]], 6. [[Intestine]]]]
Fish reproductive organs include [[testicle]]s and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt; There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of [[teleost]]s testes has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the [[seminiferous tubule]]s, while in [[wiktionary:atherinomorph|atherinomorph]] fish they are confined to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J. |author2=Santos, José E. dos |author3=Santos, Gilmar B. |title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbrücker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes) |journal=Rev.

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the [[oocyte]]s are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then enter the [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]], then through the [[oviduct]] and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed [[ovum|ova]] into the [[coelom]] from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018 |title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil |last=Brito |first=M.F.G. |author2=Bazzoli, N. |journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=2003 |doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018 |issn=0102-0935 |pages=624–633 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135717/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in [[lungfish]], [[sturgeon]], and [[bowfin]]. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"/&gt; Secondary gymnovaries are found in [[salmonid]]s and a few other teleosts.

[[Oogonia]] development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. Changes in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Postovulatory [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the [[apoptosis]] of follicular cells. A degenerative process called [[follicular atresia]] reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Some fish, like the [[California sheephead]], are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], have them simultaneously.

Over 97% of all known fish are [[oviparous]],&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. {{ISBN|1-56465-193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]], and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[clasper]]s.

Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of {{convert|1|mm}}.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fishegg A.Slotwinski TAFI.jpg|thumb|An example of [[zooplankton]]|alt=Photo of semi-transparent creature with a darker, yolk-like central structure and other approximately round internal elements]] --&gt;
The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[Ichthyoplankton|larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

In [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

Some species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. Some viviparous fish exhibit [[oophagy]], in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner"&gt;Meisner, A &amp; Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae)" ''Journal of Morphology'' 234, pp. 295–317, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner" /&gt;

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as [[livebearer]]s.

== Acoustic communication in fish ==
Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bioacoustics"/&gt;
The sounds emitted can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. Fish can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;

===Stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===
[[File:French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum.jpg|thumb|French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum]]
There are some species of fish that can produce sounds by rubbing or grinding their bones together. These noises produced by bone-on-bone interactions are known as 'stridulatory sounds'.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

An example of this is seen in ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum]]'', a species commonly referred to as the 'French grunt fish', as it produces a grunting noise by grinding its teeth together.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;
This behaviour is most pronounced when the ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum|H. flavolineatum]]'' is in distress situations.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt; The grunts produced by this species of fishes generate a frequency of approximately 700&amp;nbsp;Hz, and last approximately 47 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt; The ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum|H. flavolineatum]]'' does not emit sounds with frequencies greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and does not detect sounds that have frequencies greater than 1050&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

In a study conducted by Oliveira et al. (2014), the longsnout seahorse, ''[[Hippocampus reidi]]'', was recorded producing two different categories of sounds; ‘clicks’ and ‘growls’. The sounds emitted by the ''[[Hippocampus reidi|H. reidi]]'' are accomplished by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their neurocranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colson|first1=D.

‘Clicking’ sounds were found to be primarily produced during courtship and feeding, and the frequencies of clicks were within the range of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz-800&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Zoology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliveira|first1=T.

===Non-stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===
[[File:C(flipped).jpg|thumb|{{center|Oyster toadfish}}]]
Some fish species create noise by engaging specialized muscles that contract and cause swimbladder vibrations.

[[Oyster toadfish]] produce loud grunting sounds by contracting muscles located along the sides of their swim bladder, known as sonic muscles&lt;ref name="Experimental"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=L.

==Diseases==
{{Main|Fish diseases and parasites}}
Like other animals, fish suffer from diseases and parasites. To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. ''Non-specific'' defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that traps and inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s. If [[pathogen]]s breach these defenses, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers [[white blood cells]] that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an [[immune response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[vaccine]]s have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example [[furunculosis]] vaccines in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

Some species use [[cleaner fish]] to remove external parasites. The best known of these are the [[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''Labroides'' found on [[coral reef]]s in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. These small fish maintain so-called "cleaning stations" where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, ''[[Orange chromide|Etroplus maculatus]]'', the cleaner, and the much larger ''Etroplus suratensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyman |first1=Richard L. |last2=Ward |first2=Jack A. |year=1972 |title=A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis.

===Immune system===
Immune organs vary by type of fish.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Zapata, A. Chiba and A. Vara. ''Cells and tissues of the immune system of fish.'' In: The Fish Immune System: Organism, Pathogen and Environment. Fish Immunology Series. (eds. G. Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pp. 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[jawless fish]] (lampreys and hagfish), true [[lymph]]oid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature.) They resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.
[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to [[Chondrichthyes]]; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the [[Leydig's organ]] within the walls of their esophagus, and a [[spiral valve]] in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocyte]]s, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.
[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cell]]s and a small number of [[macrophage]]s. The chondrostean kidney is an important [[hemopoietic]] organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.

Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc. Ltd., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chilmonczyk |first=S. |title=''The thymus in fish: development and possible function in the immune response'' |journal=[[Annual Review of Fish Diseases]] |volume=2 |year=1992 |pages=181–200 |doi=10.1016/0959-8030(92)90063-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=J.D. |last2=Zapata |first2=A.G. |year=1998 |title=''Lymphocyte development in fish and amphibians'' |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=166 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01264.x|pmid=9914914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the [[zebrafish]]. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) [[T cell]]s accumulate while waiting to encounter an [[antigen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kucher |title=''Development of the zebrafish lymphatic system requires VegFc signalling'' |publisher=[[Current Biology]] |volume=16 |year=2006 |pages=1244–1248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies. For example, the [[Devil's Hole pupfish]] occupies only a single {{convert|3|by|6|m|0}} pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overfishing===
[[File:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|thumb|[[Whale shark]]s, the largest species of fish, are classified as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].|alt=Photo of shark in profile surrounded by other, much smaller fish in bright sunlight]]
{{Main|Overfishing}}

Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm |title=Call to halt cod 'over-fishing' |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=5 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117142906/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm |archivedate=17 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm |title=Tuna groups tackle overfishing |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=26 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121111204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm |archivedate=21 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing eventually causes [[Population dynamics of fisheries|population]] (known as [[Fish stock|stock]]) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such '''commercial extinction''' does not mean that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.

One well-studied example of fishery collapse is the [[Pacific sardine]] ''Sadinops sagax caerulues'' fishery off the California coast. From a 1937 peak of {{convert|790000|LT}} the catch steadily declined to only {{convert|24000|LT}} in 1968, after which the fishery was no longer economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tension between [[fisheries science]] and the [[fishing industry]] is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the [[commercial fishing|fishing industry]] is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm |title=UK 'must shield fishing industry' |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130055349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm |archivedate=30 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm |title=EU fish quota deal hammered out |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=21 December 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061226234953/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm |archivedate=26 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html |title=Ocean study predicts the collapse of all seafood fisheries by 2050 |accessdate=13 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315014325/http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html |archivedate=15 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm |title=Atlantic bluefin tuna could soon be commercially extinct |accessdate=18 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430205610/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm |archivedate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitat destruction===
{{See also|Environmental impact of fishing}}

A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including [[water pollution]], the building of dams, removal of water for use by humans, and the introduction of [[invasive species|exotic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the [[pallid sturgeon]], a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126220804/http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |archivedate=26 November 2005 |url=http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |title=Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon ''Scaphirhynchus'' Fact Sheet |accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic species===
Introduction of [[invasive species|non-native]] species has occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of [[Nile perch]] into [[Lake Victoria]] in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 [[Endemism|endemic]] [[cichlid]] species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,,1541613,00.html |title=The little fish fight back |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Laura |last=Spinney |date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carp]], [[Channidae|snakeheads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html |title=Stop That Fish! |accessdate=26 August 2007 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=3 July 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103055232/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tilapia]], [[perch|European perch]], [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[sea lamprey]]s are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.

==Importance to humans==

===Economic importance===
{{Main|Fishing industry|Aquaculture|Fish farming}}
[[File:Community fish-farming ponds in the rural town of Masi Manimba, DRC (7609946524).jpg|alt=A row of square artificial ponds, with trees on either side|thumb|These fish-farming ponds were created as a [[cooperative]] project in a rural village.]]

Throughout history, humans have utilized [[Fish as food|fish as a food source]]. Historically and today, most fish [[protein]] has come by means of catching wild fish. However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalding |first1=Mark |title=Sustainable Ancient Aquaculture |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=13 August 2015 |date=11 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518210243/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein is estimated to be provided by fish.&lt;ref name="Helfman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Helfman |first1=Gene S. |title=Fish Conservation: A Guide to Understanding and Restoring Global Aquatic Biodiversity and Fishery Resources |date=2007 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1597267601 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proportion is considerably elevated in some [[developing nation]]s and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.

Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as [[fishing]], while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a [[fishery]]. Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people.&lt;ref name="Helfman" /&gt; The annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf |website=fao.org |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828131307/http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with popular species including [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], and [[salmon]]. However, the term fishery is broadly applied, and includes more organisms than just fish, such as [[Mollusca|mollusks]] and [[crustacean]]s, which are often called "fish" when used as food.

===Recreation===
{{Main|Fishkeeping|Recreational fishing|Angling}}
Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in [[cave art]], being raised as [[ornamental fish]] in ponds, and displayed in [[aquarium]]s in homes, offices, or public settings.

''Recreational fishing'' is fishing for pleasure or competition; it can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is fishing for profit. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[fish hook|hook]]s and any one of a wide range of [[bait (luring substance)|baits]]. Angling is a method of fishing, specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an "angle" (hook). Anglers must select the right hook, [[cast net|cast]] accurately, and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions, species, fish response, time of the day, and other factors.

=== Culture ===
{{main|Fish in culture}}

[[File:Matsya painting.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] as a [[Matsya]]|alt=Photo of painting showing blue-skinned, 4-armed upper body of man standing in the opened mouth of a fish with bent tail with other, paler men facing him with hands raised together]]

Fish feature prominently in art and literature, in movies such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and books such as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''. Large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently been the subject of [[Horror film|horror movies]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], most notably the novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'', which spawned a series of films of the [[Jaws (film)|same name]] that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as ''[[Shark Tale]]'' and ''[[Snakehead Terror]]''. Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''; however, contrary to popular belief, the [[red-bellied piranha]] is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zollinger |first1=Sue Anne |title=Piranha–Ferocious Fighter or Scavenging Softie? |url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/ |website=A Moment of Science |publisher=Indiana Public Media |accessdate=1 November 2015 |date=3 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017010303/http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/ |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends of half-human, half-fish [[mermaid]]s have featured in folklore, including the stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

==Terminology==
===Fish or fishes===
Though often used interchangeably, in biology these words have different meanings. ''Fish'' is used as a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. ''Fishes'' is used to describe different species or species groups.&lt;ref name="Pauly2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pauly |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Pauly |title=Fish(es) |encyclopedia=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77 |date=13 May 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-45181-9 |page=77 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208060837/https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77 |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph S. Nelson|Nelson, Joseph S]] and Paetz, Martin Joseph (1992) [http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf ''The Fishes of Alberta''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085249/http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf |date=7 April 2014 }} page 400, University of Alberta. {{ISBN|9780888642363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="publishing5"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.

===True fish and finfish=== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[True fish]], [[Fin-fish]] and [[Finfish]] redirect here --&gt;
* In biology, the term ''fish'' is most strictly used to describe any animal with a [[Vertebral column|backbone]] that has [[gill]]s throughout life and has limbs, if any, in the shape of [[fin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fishes of the World |last=Nelson |first=Joseph S. |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-25031-9 |pages=2|title-link=Fishes of the World }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s with common names ending in "fish" are not fish in this [[Fish#Definition|sense]]; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction—sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seal]]s, whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name="integrated" /&gt;
* In fisheries, the term ''fish'' is used as a collective term, and includes [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and any [[aquatic animal]] which is harvested.&lt;ref name="fao glossary"&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp ''Fisheries glossary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129213844/http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp |date=29 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a ''true fish''. True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.

===Shoal or school===
{{Main|Shoaling and schooling}}
[[File:School of Pterocaesio chrysozona in Papua New Guinea 1.jpg|thumb|These [[goldband fusilier]]s are [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] because their swimming is synchronised.|alt=Photo of thousands of fish separated from each other by distances of {{convert|2|in}} or less]]

A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an ''aggregation''. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A ''shoal'' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. ''Schools'' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helfman |first=G. |last2=Collette |first2=B. |last3=Facey |first3=D. |year=1997 |title=The Diversity of Fishes |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=375 |isbn=978-0-86542-256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* Cichlids congregating at [[Lek (mating arena)|lekking]] sites form an ''aggregation''.
* Many minnows and characins form ''shoals''.
* Anchovies, herrings and silversides are classic examples of ''schooling'' fish.

While the words "school" and "shoal" have different meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as [[synonym]]s. Thus speakers of [[British English]] commonly use "shoal" to describe any grouping of fish, and speakers of [[American English]] commonly use "school" just as loosely.&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher T. J. and Parish J. K.

The field of [[psychology]] has been greatly influenced by the study of [[genetics]]. Decades of research has demonstrated that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in a variety of behaviors in humans and animals (e.g. Grigorenko &amp; Sternberg, 2003). The genetic basis of [[aggression]], however, remains poorly understood. Aggression is a multi-dimensional concept, but it can be generally defined as behavior that inflicts pain or harm on another.

Genetic-developmental theory states that individual differences in a continuous [[phenotype]] result from the action of a large number of [[genes]], each exerting an effect that works with environmental factors to produce the trait.&lt;ref name="Tremblay05"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tremblay, Richard E., Hartup, Willard W. and Archer, John (eds.) |year=2005 |title=Developmental Origins of Aggression |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=1-59385-110-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of trait is influenced by multiple factors making it more complex and difficult to study than a simple [[Mendelian]] trait (one [[gene]] for one [[phenotype]]).

==History==
Past thought on genetic factors influencing aggression tended to seek answers from [[chromosomal abnormalities]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Specifically, four decades ago, the [[XYY]] genotype was (erroneously) believed by many to be correlated with aggression. In 1965 and 1966, researchers at the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]] Clinical &amp; Population Cytogenetics Research Unit led by Dr. Court Brown at [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]] reported finding a much higher than expected nine XYY men (2.9%) averaging almost 6&amp;nbsp;ft. tall in a survey of 314 patients at the [[State Hospital]] for [[Scotland]]; seven of the nine XYY patients were mentally retarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Court Brown, W.M. |year=1967 |title=Human Population Cytogenetics |location=Amsterdam |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their initial reports published before examining the XYY patients, the researchers suggested they might have been hospitalized because of aggressive behavior. When the XYY patients were examined, the researchers found their assumptions of aggressive behavior were incorrect. Unfortunately, many science and medicine textbooks quickly and uncritically incorporated the initial, incorrect assumptions about XYY and aggression—including psychology textbooks on aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnson, Roger N. |year=1972 |title=Aggression in Man and Animals |location=Philadelphia |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |isbn=0-7216-5160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XYY genotype first gained wide notoriety in 1968 when it was raised as a part of a defense in two murder trials in [[Australia]] and [[France]]. In the [[United States]], five attempts to use the XYY genotype as a defense were unsuccessful—in only one case in 1969 was it allowed to go to a jury—which rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denno, Deborah H. |year=1996 |chapter=Legal implications of genetics and crime research |editor=Bock, Gregory R. |editor2=Goode, Jamie A. |title=Genetics of Criminal and Antisocial Behavior |pages=248–264 |location=Chichester |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn= 0-471-95719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results from several decades of long-term follow-up of scores of unselected XYY males identified in eight international newborn chromosome screening studies in the 1960s and 1970s have replaced pioneering but [[ascertainment bias|biased]] studies from the 1960s (that used only institutionalized XYY men), as the basis for current understanding of the XYY genotype and established that XYY males are characterized by increased height but are not characterized by aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allanson, Judith E. |author2=Graham, Gail E. |year=2002 |chapter=Sex chromosome abnormalities |editor1=Rimoin, David L. |editor2=Connor, J. Michael. |editor3=Pyeritz, Reed E. |editor4=Korf, Bruce R. |title=Emery and Rimoin's Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics |edition=4th |pages=1184–1201 |location=London |publisher=Churchill-Livingstone |isbn= 0-443-06434-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Milunsky, Jeff M. |year=2004 |chapter=Prenatal Diagnosis of Sex Chromosome Abnormalities |editor=Milunsky, Aubrey |title= Genetic Disorders and the Fetus: Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment |edition=5th |pages=297–340 |location=Baltimore |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-7928-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the link currently between genetics and aggression has turned to an aspect of genetics different from chromosomal abnormalities, it is important to understand where the research started and the direction it is moving towards today.

==Heritability==
[[Aggression]], as well as other behavioral traits, is studied genetically based on its [[heritability]] through generations. Heritability models of aggression are mainly based on animals due to the ethical concern in using humans for [[genetics|genetic]] study. Animals are first selectively bred and then placed in a variety of environmental conditions, allowing researchers to examine the differences of [[Selection (biology)|selection]] in the aggression of animals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Research methods===
As with other topics in [[behavioral genetics]], aggression is studied in three main experimental ways to help identify what role [[genetics]] plays in the [[behavior]]:
* [[Heritability]] studies – studies focused to determine whether a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]], such as aggression, is heritable and how it is inherited from parent to offspring. These studies make use of genetic linkage maps to identify [[genes]] associated with certain behaviors such as aggression.
* Mechanism experiments – studies to determine the biological mechanisms that lead certain genes to influence types of behavior like aggression.
* Genetic behavior [[correlation]] studies – studies that use scientific data and attempt to correlate it with actual human behavior. Examples include [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]].

These three main experimental types are used in [[animal studies]], studies testing heritability and [[molecular genetics]], and gene/environment interaction studies. Recently, important links between aggression and genetics have been studied and the results are allowing scientists to better understand the connections.&lt;ref name="Nelson06"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nelson, Randy Joe (ed.) |year=2006 |title=Biology of Aggression |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-516876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective breeding===
The [[heritability]] of aggression has been observed in many animal strains after noting that some strains of birds, dogs, fish, and mice seem to be more [[aggressive]] than other strains. [[Selective breeding]] has demonstrated that it is possible to select for genes that lead to more aggressive behavior in animals.&lt;ref name="Nelson06"/&gt; Selective breeding examples also allow researchers to understand the importance of [[developmental]] timing for genetic influences on aggressive behavior. A study done in 1983 (Cairns) produced both highly aggressive male and female strains of mice dependent on certain developmental periods to have this more aggressive behavior expressed. These mice were not observed to be more aggressive during the early and later stages of their lives, but during certain periods of time (in their middle-age period) were more violent and aggressive in their attacks on other mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brain, Paul F. and Benton, David (eds.) |year=1981 |title=The Biology of Aggression |location= Alphan aan den Rijn, The Netherlands |publisher=Sijthoff and Noordhoff |isbn=90-286-2851-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selective breeding is a quick way to select for specific [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] and see those selected traits within a few generations of [[reproduction|breeding]]. These characteristics make selective breeding an important tool in the study of genetics and aggressive behavior.

===Mouse studies===
[[Mice]] are often used as a model for human [[genetics|genetic]] behavior since mice and humans have [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[genes]] coding for homologous [[proteins]] that are used for similar functions at some biological levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Southwick, Charles H. |year=1970 |title=Animal Aggression: Selected Readings |location=London |publisher=Litton Educational Publishing Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice aggression studies have led to some interesting insight in human aggression. Using [[reverse genetics]], the [[DNA]] of genes for the receptors of many [[neurotransmitter]]s have been [[cloned]] and [[sequenced]], and the role of neurotransmitters in rodent aggression has been investigated using [[pharmacological]] manipulations. [[Serotonin]] has been identified in the offensive attack by male mice against intruder male mice. Mutants were made by manipulating a receptor for serotonin by deleting a gene for the serotonin receptor. These mutant male mice with the knockout [[alleles]] exhibited normal behavior in everyday activities such as eating and exploration, but when prompted, attacked intruders with twice the intensity of normal male mice. In offense aggression in mice, males with the same or similar [[genotype]]s were more likely to fight than males that encountered males of other genotypes. Another interesting finding in mice dealt with mice reared alone. These mice showed a strong tendency to attack other male mice upon their first exposure to the other animals. The mice reared alone were not taught to be more aggressive; they simply exhibited the behavior. This implicates the natural tendency related to biological aggression in mice since the mice reared alone lacked a parent to model aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Bock96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bock, Gregory R. and Goode, Jamie A. (eds.) |year=1996 |title=Genetics of Criminal and Antisocial Behavior |location=Chichester |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-471-95719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxidative stress]] arises as a result of excess production of reactive oxygen species in relation to defense mechanisms, including the action of [[antioxidant]]s such as superoxide dismutase 1 ([[SOD1]]).  Knockout of the Sod1 gene was experimentally introduced in male mice leading to impaired [[antioxidant]] defense.&lt;ref name="pmid25524980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garratt M, Brooks RC |title=A genetic reduction in antioxidant function causes elevated aggression in mice |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=218 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=223–7 |date=January 2015 |pmid=25524980 |doi=10.1242/jeb.112011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These mice were designated (''Sod1-/-'').   The ''Sod1-/-'' male mice proved to be more aggressive than both [[zygosity|heterozygous]] knockout males (''Sod1+/-'') that were 50% deficient in SOD1, and wild-type males (''Sod1+/+'').&lt;ref name="pmid25524980" /&gt;  The basis for the association of oxidative stress with increased aggression has not yet been determined.

==Biological mechanisms==
Experiments designed to study biological mechanisms are utilized when exploring how [[aggression]] is influenced by [[genetics]]. [[Molecular genetics]] studies allow many different types of behavioral traits to be examined by manipulating [[genes]] and studying the effect(s) of the manipulation.

===Molecular genetics===
A number of [[molecular genetics]] studies have focused on manipulating candidate aggression [[genes]] in mice and other animals to induce effects that can be possibly applied to humans. Most studies have focused on [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] of [[serotonin]] receptors, [[dopamine]] receptors, and [[neurotransmitter]] metabolizing [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name="Tremblay05"/&gt; Results of these studies have led to [[linkage analysis]] to map the serotonin-related genes and impulsive aggression, as well as dopamin-related genes and proactive aggression. In particular, the serotonin [[5-HT]] seems to be an influence in inter-male [[aggression]] either directly or through other molecules that use the 5-HT pathway. 5-HT normally dampens aggression in animals and humans. Mice missing specific genes for 5-HT were observed to be more aggressive than normal mice and were more rapid and violent in their attacks.&lt;ref name="Nelson01"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nelson, Randy J.  |author2=Chiavegatto, Silvana |year=2001 |title=Molecular basis of aggression |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=713–9 |pmid=11718876 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01996-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have been focused on neurotransmitters. Studies of a [[mutation]] in the neurotransmitter metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) have been shown to cause a syndrome that includes violence and impulsivity in humans.&lt;ref name="Tremblay05"/&gt; Studies of the molecular genetics pathways are leading to the production of [[pharmaceuticals]] to fix the pathway problems and hopefully show an observed change in aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Nelson01"/&gt;

==Human behavior genetics==
In determining if a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] is related to genetic factors or environmental factors, [[twin studies]] and adoption studies are used. These studies examine [[correlations]] based on similarity of a trait and a person's genetic or environmental factors that could influence the trait. [[Aggression]] has been examined via both twin studies and adoption studies.

===Twin studies===
Twin studies manipulate the environmental factors of behavior by examining if [[identical twins]] raised apart are different from twins raised together. Before the advancement of [[molecular genetics]], twin studies were almost the only mode of investigation of [[genetics|genetic]] influences on personality. [[Heritability]] was estimated as twice the difference between the [[correlation]] for identical, or monozygotic, twins and that for fraternal, or dizygotic, twins. Early studies indicated that personality was fifty percent genetic. Current thinking holds that each individual picks and chooses from a range of [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and events largely on the basis of his [[genotype]] creating a unique set of experiences; basically meaning that people create their own environments.&lt;ref name="Bock96"/&gt;

'''Headworks''' is a civil engineering term for any structure at the head or diversion point of a waterway. It is smaller than a [[barrage (dam)|barrage]] and is used to divert water from a river into a canal or from a large canal into a smaller canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual of irrigation engineering|first1=Herbert Michael |last1=Wilson|chapter=CHAPTER 10. HEADWORKS AND DIVERSION WEIRS |url=https://archive.org/details/manualirrigatio02wilsgoog |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1896|isbn= |page=155  |ref= }} at [[Web archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the phrase "headworks" derives from the traditional approach of diverting water at the start of an irrigation network and the location of these processes at the "head of the works".

'''Hyperreality''', in [[semiotics]] and [[postmodernism]], is an inability of [[consciousness]] to distinguish [[reality]] from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern [[Society|societies]]. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.&lt;ref name="Tiffin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiffin|first=John|author2=Nobuyoshi Terashima|title=Paradigm for the third millennium|journal=Hyperreality|year=2005|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the co-mingling of physical [[reality]] with [[virtual reality]] (VR) and [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref name="Tiffin" /&gt; Individuals may find themselves, for different reasons, more in tune or involved with the hyperreal world and less with the physical real world. Some famous theorists of hyperreality/hyperrealism include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], [[Neil Postman]] and [[Umberto Eco]].

==Origins and usage==
The postmodern semiotic concept of "hyperreality" was contentiously coined by French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]] in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. Baudrillard defined "hyperreality" as "the generation by models of a real without origin or reality";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309115319/https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. Baudrillard believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard in particular suggests that the world we live in has been replaced by a copy world, where we seek simulated stimuli and nothing more. Baudrillard borrows, from [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" (already borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]]),the example of a society whose [[Cartography|cartographers]] create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape.  He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal.  Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Baudrillard challenges McLuhan's famous statement that the 'medium is the message', by suggesting that information devours its own content. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;Zompetti, J. P., &amp; Moffitt, M. A. (2008). Revisiting Concepts of Public Relations Audience Through Postmodern Concepts of Metanarrative, Decentered Subject, and Reality/Hyperreality. Journal of Promotion Management, 14(3/4), 275-291. doi:10.1080/10496490802623762.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: "There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined".&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"&gt;Laughey, D. (2010). Key themes in media theory. Maidenhead: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eco |first=Umberto |title=Travels in Hyperreality |url=http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |work=The fortress of Solitude |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521085018/http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to contemporary [[western culture]] Umberto Eco and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] would argue, that in current cultures fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular [[Sign system|sign-systems]].

Hyperreality can also be thought of as "reality by proxy"; simply put, an individual takes on someone else's version of reality and claims it as his or her own. For example, persons who watch soap operas for an extended period of time may develop a view of interpersonal relationships (reality) that are skewed by how the writers depict the characters and situations within the show. Individuals may begin to believe that these extreme dramatic relationships are authentic and real, and they may begin to judge social relationships and situations by this heightened lens of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=Garry|title=What is Hyperreality|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hyperreality.htm|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Hyperreality is significant as a [[paradigm]] to explain current cultural conditions. [[Consumerism]], because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word), fulfillment or [[happiness]] is found through simulation and imitation of a transient [[simulacrum]] of reality, rather than any interaction with any "real" [[reality]].

While hyperreality is not a relatively new concept, its effects are more relevant today than when it was first conceptualized.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This is attributed to the way it effectively captured the postmodern condition, particularly how people in the postmodern world seek stimulation by creating unreal worlds of spectacle and seduction and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412978200|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, "we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bemoans the loss of old heroes like [[Moses]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Aeneas]], [[Jesus]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Muhammad|Muhammed]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[George Washington]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], who did not have [[public relations]] (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction|last=Kincheloe|first=Joe|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2008|isbn=9781402082238|location=New York|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger in the pursuit of stimulation and seduction emerge not in the lack of meaning but, as Baudrillard maintained, "we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping the Subject: Geographies of Cultural Transformation|last=Pile|first=Steve|last2=Thrift|first2=Nigel|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=0415102251|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperreality, some sources point out, may provide insights into the postmodern moment by analyzing how simulations disrupt the [[binary opposition]] between reality and [[illusion]] but  it does not address or resolve the contradictions inherent in this tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Postmodernism, Page 2|last=Taylor|first=Victor|last2=Winquist|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415152941|location=London|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key relational themes==
Simulation/Simulacra: 
The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by [[Jean Baudrillard]] in his book ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''.  The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality.

===Simulation===
[[Simulation]] is characterized by a blending of 'reality' and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; "It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc.

===Simulacrum===
The [[simulacrum]] is often defined as a copy with no original, or as [[Gilles Deleuze]] (1990) describes it, "the simulacrum is an image without resemblance". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boundas|first=Gilles Deleuze ; translated by Mark Lester with Charles Stivale ; edited by Constantin V.|title=The logic of sense|year=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231059831|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right. He created four steps of reproduction: (1) basic reflection of reality, (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretense of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Doug|title=Jean Baudrillard|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/baudrillard1.htm|work=A Very Short Introduction|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotations ==
"Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map." — Jean Baudrillard, "The Precession of Simulacra," ''Simulacra and Simulation''

== Examples ==

=== Disneyland ===
Both [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] refer to [[Disneyland]] as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look "absolutely realistic", taking visitors' imagination to a "fantastic past".&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', New York, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere "can give us more reality than nature can".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fake nature" of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life.The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour.&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"/&gt; When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy "the real thing" and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland's doors.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', Baudrillard argues the "imaginary world" of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as "imaginary" to make people believe that all its surroundings are "real". But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called "real". This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and "concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," in ''Selected Writings'', Mark Poster, ed. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It's meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness."&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," pp. 166-184&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Industrial Revolution in Scotland''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes and economic expansion between the mid-eighteenth century and the late nineteenth century. By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing [[British Empire]], resulting in the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707. There was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve [[agriculture in Scotland]]. New crops were introduced and [[enclosure]]s began to displace the [[run rig]] system and free pasture. The economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glass-works, breweries, and soap-works, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial center after 1815.

The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute, and woolen industries. Encouraged and subsidized by the [[Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland|Board of Trustees]] so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. Historians often emphasize that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the [[American Civil War]] Scottish entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870. As a result, Scotland became a center for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives.

Scotland was already one of the most urbanized societies in Europe by 1800. Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London. [[History of Dundee|Dundee]] upgraded its harbor and established itself as an industrial and trading center. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. Owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class. Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, as a result, during the period 1841–1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were [[Scottish Canadians]] and [[Scottish American]]s as the five million remaining in Scotland.

==Background==
{{Main|Scotland in the modern era}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adam Smith]]. the "father of modern economics"]]
By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing [[British Empire]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]] voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69 to adopt the [[Treaty of Union]]. It was a full economic union. Most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as "Great Britain". It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Smout, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707.

Major factors that facilitated industrialisation in Scotland included cheap and abundant labour; natural resources that included coal, blackband [[ironstone]] and potential water power; the development of new technologies, among them the [[steam engine]] and markets that would buy Scottish products. Other factors that also contributed to the process included the improvement of transport links, which helped facilitated the movement of goods, an extensive banking system, and the widespread adoption of ideas about economic development with their origins in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"&gt;R.

===Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
In the eighteenth century, the Scottish Enlightenment brought the country to the front of intellectual achievement in Europe.&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;[[Arthur L. Herman|A. Herman]], ''[[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]]'' (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), {{ISBN|0-609-80999-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific. Adam Smith developed and published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' the first work of modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British [[economic policy]] and still frames discussions on [[globalisation]] and [[tariff]]s.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0-415-06164-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key scientific work included the discoveries of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist, [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]], [[Joseph Black]], [[physicist]] and chemist, and [[James Hutton]], the first modern [[geologist]].&lt;ref name="Repcheck"&gt;J.

===Agricultural revolution===
{{Main|Scottish Agricultural Revolution}}
[[File:George Heriot Swanston03.jpg|thumb|right|alt=man guiding two horses pushing machine |An 1851 illustration showing the reaping machine developed by [[Patrick Bell]]]]
After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as [[John Cockburn (Scottish politician)|John Cockburn]] and [[Sir Archibald Grant, 2nd Baronet|Archibald Grant]]. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp206-7"&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hay]]making was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and [[crop rotation]] were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. [[Enclosure]]s began to displace the [[Run rig|runrig]] system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers,&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly known as the [[Lowland Clearances]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-521-89167-1}}, pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; when hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; Improvement continued in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working [[Reaper|reaping machine]], developed by [[Patrick Bell]] in 1828. His rival [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.&lt;ref name="Sprott2011"&gt;G. Sprot, "Agriculture, 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 321–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Scottish agriculture meant that Scotland could support its increased population with food and it released labour that would take part in industrial production.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt;

===Banking===
[[File:Former British Linen Bank, St. Andrew Square Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The former headquarters of the [[British Linen Bank]] in St Andrews Square, Edinburgh]]
The first banks formed in Scotland were the [[Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1695) and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1727).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saville, ''Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695–1995'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0757-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow would soon follow with branches of its own (notably, the first was to be Dunlop, Houston &amp; Co. in 1749, known as "the Ship Bank" for the image of a ship printed on all their bills)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7,000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700–1850'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-19-822281-5}}, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Cowen and R. Kroszner, "Scottish Banking before 1845: A Model for Laissez-Faire?", ''Journal of Money, Credit and Banking'', vol. 21 (2), (May, 1989), pp. 221–31, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1992370 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; As a joint-stock company the British Linen Company had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity.&lt;ref name="A. Malcolm, 1950"&gt;C. A. Malcolm, ''The History of the British Linen Bank'' (Edinburgh: T. &amp; A. Constable, 1950), {{ISBN|1446526283}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
The extensive Scottish coastline meant that few parts of the country that were not within easy reach of sea transportation, particularly the central belt that would be the heartland of industrial development. Before the eighteenth century most roads were relatively poor dirt tracks. In the late eighteenth century there were improvements carried out by [[turnpike trusts]] and the creation of a series of [[Old military roads of Scotland|military roads]].&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; Canal building also developed, with four major lowland canals: the [[Forth and Clyde Canal|Forth and Clyde]], [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union]], [[Monkland Canal|Monkland]] and [[Crinan Canal|Crinan]] and further north the [[Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal|Paisley]], [[Caledonian Canal|Caledonian]] and [[Aberdeenshire Canal|Inverurie]] canals, carrying thousands of passengers and tons of goods by the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Durie, "Movement, transport and tourism" in T. Griffiths and G. Morton, eds, ''A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748621709}}, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exports===
[[File:'Ships off Greenock, Scotland' by Robert Salmon, Cincinnati Art Museum.JPG|thumb|''Ships off Greenock, Scotland'' (1813) by [[Robert Salmon]]]]
With tariffs with England abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with [[Colonial America]]. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million.&lt;ref name="H. Hamilton, 1963"&gt;H. Hamilton, ''An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Scotland's economy had been ravaged by the [[Darien scheme]]: according to some estimates, half of all the circulating wealth in Scotland went into the scheme. Glasgow merchants had been particularly enthusiastic, and consequently had no ships of their own for twenty years following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Massie, ''Glasgow: Portraits of a City'' (Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1989), p. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow [[Tobacco Lords]] were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lester, "The Tobacco Lords: A study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Activities", ''Virginia Historical Society'' Vol. 84, No. 1 (1976), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4248011?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103494003161 in JSTOR], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade had started as smuggling during the 1600s, but with the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], it became legal and trade picked up.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, "The Colonial Trades and Industrial Investment in Scotland, c. 1700–1815," ''Economic History Review,'' Feb 1976, vol. 29 (1), pp. 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when its sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began to make up for the loss of the tobacco business,&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Campbell, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences," ''Economic History Review,'' April 1964 vol. 16, pp. 468–477 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2592849 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, "An Eighteenth-Century Business Élite: Glasgow-West India Merchants, c 1750–1815," ''Scottish Historical Review,'' April 1978, vol. 57 (1), pp. 40–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p296&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linen===
[[File:NewlanarkNL06.jpg|thumb|left|[[New Lanark]], cotton mills and housing on the River Clyde, founded in 1786]]
Linen manufacture was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute,&lt;ref&gt;L. Miskell and C. A. Whatley, "'Juteopolis' in the Making: Linen and the Industrial Transformation of Dundee, c. 1820–1850," ''[[Textile History]],'' Autumn 1999, vol. 30 (2), pp. 176–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and woollen industries.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Durie, "The Markets for Scottish Linen, 1730–1775", ''Scottish Historical Review'' vol. 52, no. 153, Part 1 (April, 1973), pp. 30–49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25528985 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish industrial policy was made by the [[Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland]], which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woolens, this meant linen.&lt;ref name=Durie1993/&gt; The Scottish members of parliament managed to see off an attempt to impose an export duty on linen and from 1727 it received subsidies of £2,750 a year for six years, resulting in a considerable expansion of the trade. Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p292&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees, so that they could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref name=Durie1993&gt;Alastair Durie, "Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen," ''Journal of Design History,'' 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the eighteenth century, exporting linen to England and America.&lt;ref name="A. Malcolm, 1950"/&gt; In 1728, 2.2 million yards of linen cloth had been produced and by 1730 it had already supplanted woollen cloth as the major manufacturing industry. By 1750 it reached 7.6 million and it peaked at 12.1 million yards in 1775. However, there were sharp slumps, particularly in the periods  1734–43 and 1763–72. It was a mainly rural industry, with most of the manufacture carried out in homes, rather than factories. It employed perhaps 100,000 people, four out of five of which were women who spun the flax, while men operated the looms.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p381"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government promoted the use of linen from the late 17th century: a 1686 Act of Parliament stated that all Scots were to be buried in Scottish-made linen winding sheets, using Scottish flax. In 1748, an embargo on the import or use of French [[cambric]] provided a further boost to the linen industry.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1770, [[Glasgow]] was the largest linen manufacturer in Britain, and in 1787, [[Calton, Glasgow]] was the site of Scotland's first industrial dispute when 7,000 weavers went on strike in protest against a 25% cut in their wages. The [[39th Foot]] were sent in, and three people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheer linen, which had then come into vogue, was almost unobtainable in Scotland in the 1780s. In a bid to stay competitive, Glasgow manufacturers turned to fine cotton muslin, at which they succeeded so well that it became cheaper than imported Indian muslins.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern'' (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; With the popularity of Indian muslins, from the 1760s onwards, had come a fashion for [[tambour lace]], or [[sewed muslin]], which briefly became a flourishing business in Ayrshire, thanks to the enterprising spirit of [[Mrs Jamieson]].

==Nineteenth century==

The economy, long based on agriculture,&lt;ref name="H. Hamilton, 1963"/&gt; began to industrialize after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the production of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the [[American Civil War]] the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cotton===
From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton. The first cotton spinning mill was opened at [[Penicuik]] in 1778. By 1787 Scotland had 19 mills, 95 by 1795 and there were 192 by 1839. The rise of cotton was the result of a sudden fall in the price of the raw materials, mostly imported from the US, and the availability of a pool of cheap labour caused by population rise and migration. In 1775 137,000&amp;nbsp;lb of raw cotton were being imported into the Clyde and by 1812 it had increased eightfold to over 11 million lb. The capital invested in the industry increased sevenfold between 1790 and 1840.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"/&gt; By 1800, cotton was the main industry in the Glasgow area: [[New Lanark]] mills were at the time the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Early production was aided by the new technology of the [[spinning mule]], [[water frame]] and water power.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; Steam powered machines were introduced into the industry from 1782.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"/&gt; However, only about a third of workers were employed in factories and it continued to rely heavily on the [[hand loom]] weaver, working in his own home. In 1790 there were about 10,000 weavers involved in cotton manufacture and by 1800 it was 50,000.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p384"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; The cotton industry flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Henderson, ''The Lancashire Cotton Famine 1861–65'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1934), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources.&lt;ref name="A. Whatley, 1997 p. 51"&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-521-57643-1}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
[[File:Francis Colliery Headgear - geograph.org.uk - 305376.jpg|thumb|left|The headgear at Francis Colliery, Fife]]
Coal mining became a major industry, and continued to grow into the twentieth century, producing the fuel to smelt iron, heat homes and factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. Coal mining expanded rapidly in the eighteenth century, reaching 700,000 tons a year by 1750. Most coal was in five fields across the [[Central Belt]]. The first [[Newcomen Steam Engine]] was introduced into a Scottish colliery in 1719, but water remained the most important source of power for most of the century. With increased demand for household fuel from a growing urban population and the emerging demands of heavy industry, production grew from an estimated 1 million tons a year in 1775, to 3 million by 1830.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp211-12"/&gt; Production almost doubled by the 1840s and peaked in 1914 at about 42 million tons a year.&lt;ref name="Whatley2001pp208-9"&gt;C. A. Whatley, "Economy: primary sector: 3 mining and quarrying", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 208–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially increased production was made possible by the introduction of cheap labour, provided from the 1830s by large numbers of Irish immigrants.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p408"/&gt; There were then changes in mining practices, which included the introduction of [[blasting powder]] in the 1850s and the use of mechanised methods of transferring the coal to the surface,&lt;ref&gt;W. Knox, ''Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800–present'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press Series, 1999), {{ISBN|0748610855}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the introduction of steam power in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p408"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Landed proprietors were replaced by profit-seeking [[leasehold]] partnerships and [[joint-stock]] companies, whose members were often involved in the emerging iron industry.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp211-12"&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Economy: primary sector: 1 industry to 1770s", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 211–12.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914 there were a million coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs;&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Whatley, "Scottish 'collier serfs', British coal workers? Aspects of Scottish collier society in the eighteenth century", ''Labour History Review,'' Fall 1995, vol. 60 (2), pp. 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with a strong emphasis on masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.&lt;ref&gt;A. Campbell, ''The Scottish Miners, 1874–1939'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), {{ISBN|0-7546-0191-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron and steel===
[[File:Monkland Rlies 1848.gif|thumb|right|Map of the Monkland Railways and surrounding lines in 1848]]
The invention of [[James Beaumont Neilson]]'s [[hot blast]] process for smelting iron in 1828 revolutionised the Scottish iron industry, allowing abundant native blackstone iron ore to be smelted with ordinary coal.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; In 1830 Scotland had 27 iron furnaces and by 1840 it was 70, 143 in 1850 and it peaked at 171 in 1860.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p407"/&gt; Output was over 2,500,000 tons of iron ore in 1857, 6.5 per cent of UK output. Output of [[pig iron]] rose from 797,000 tons in 1854 to peak at 1,206,00 in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives.&lt;ref name="A. Whatley, 1997 p. 51"/&gt; In the 1871 census, the workforce in heavy industry overtook textiles in the Strathclyde region and in 1891 it became the majority employer in the country. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, steel production largely replaced iron production.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p407"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways===
Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between [[Monklands (district)|Monkland]] and [[Kirkintilloch]], opened in 1826. By the late 1830s there was a network of railways that included lines between Dundee and Arbroath, and connecting Glasgow, Paisley and Ayr. The line between Glasgow and Edinburgh, largely designed for passenger transport, opened in 1842 and proved highly successful. By the mid-1840s the mania for railways had begun.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p410"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; A good passenger service established by the late 1840s, and a network of freight lines reduced the cost of shipping coal, making products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp17-52/&gt; The [[North British Railway]] was formed in 1844 to link Edinburgh and eastern Scotland with Newcastle and the next year the [[Caledonian Railway]] began connecting Glasgow and the west to Carlisle. The creation of a dense network in the Lowlands with connections to England would take until the 1870s to complete.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp26-7/&gt;

A series of amalgamations meant that five main companies operated 98 per cent of the system by the 1860s. The capital invested in Scottish railways was £26.6 million in 1859 and by 1900 it had reached £166.1 million. The floatation of railway companies was a major factor in the formation of the Scottish stock exchanges and the rise of share holding in Scotland and after the early stages drew in large amounts of English investment.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp26-7&gt;O.

===Shipbuilding===
[[File:Govan cranes.JPG|thumb|left|Surviving cranes at the former [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] shipyard in [[Govan]]]]
Shipbuilding on [[Clydeside]] (the river Clyde through Glasgow and other points) began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scott family's]] shipyard at Greenock.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shields, ''Clyde Built: a History of Ship-Building on the River Clyde'' (Glasgow: William MacLellan, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Major firms included [[William Denny and Brothers|Denny]] of Dumbarton, [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] of Greenock, [[Lithgows]] of Port Glasgow, Simon and [[Lobnitz]] of Renfrew, [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] of Linthouse, [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] of Govan, [[A. &amp; J. Inglis|Inglis]] of Pointhouse, [[Barclay Curle]] of Whiteinch, [[Charles Connell and Company|Connell]] and [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] of Scotstoun. Equally important were the engineering firms that supplied the machinery to drive these vessels, the boilers and pumps and steering gear – Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Hastie's and Kincaid's of Greenock, Rowan's of Finnieston, [[Weir Group|Weir's]] of Cathcart, Howden's of Tradeston and [[Doosan Babcock|Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] of Renfrew.&lt;ref&gt;R. Johnston, ''Clydeside Capital, 1870–1920: a Social History of Employers'' (Tuckwell Press, 2000), {{ISBN|1862321027}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest customer was Sir William Mackinnon, who ran five shipping companies in the nineteenth century from his base in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;J. Forbes Munro, ''Maritime Enterprise and Empire: Sir William Mackinnon and His Business Network, 1823–1893'' (Boydell Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0851159354}}, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan works, owned by [[Robert Napier and Sons]] were the first to start the production of large passenger iron ships in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p409"/&gt;

In 1835 the Clyde produced only 5 per cent of the ship tonnage built in Britain. The transition from wooden to iron ships was an uneven one, with wooden ships still cheaper to build until around 1850 and the material continued to be used until the 1860s in ships with composite hulls, like the clipper the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', which was launched from Dumbarton in 1869. Cost also delayed the transition from iron to steel shipbuilding and as late as 1879 only 18,000&amp;nbsp;tons of steel-built shipping was launched on the Clyde, 10 per cent of all tonnage. A similar process occurred in means of propulsion with shifts from sail to steam and back again between the 1840s and the introduction of the more efficient [[steam turbine]] engine that became dominant in the mid-1880s. Tonnage increased by more than a factor of six between 1880 and 1914.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p409"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Production peaked during the First World War and the term "Clyde-built" became synonymous with industrial quality.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp199-200"&gt;R.

===Engineering architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Forth bridge histo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Forth Bridge]] on completion in 1890]]
The nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including [[Thomas Telford]]'s (1757–1834) stone [[Dean Bridge]] (1829–31) and iron [[Craigellachie Bridge]] (1812–14).&lt;ref&gt;C. Harvie, ''Scotland: A Short History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-19-210054-8}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s the possibilities of new [[wrought iron|wrought-]] and [[cast-iron]] construction were explored in the building of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian]] style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–56), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Engine Works built in 1856–58, using massive rubble blocks.&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep254&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0849-2}}, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important engineering project was the [[Forth Bridge]], a [[cantilever bridge|cantilever]] railway bridge over the [[Firth of Forth]] in the east of [[Scotland]], 14&amp;nbsp;kilometres (9&amp;nbsp;mi) west of central [[Edinburgh]]. Construction of a [[suspension bridge]] designed by [[Thomas Bouch]] (1822–80), was stopped after the collapse of another of his works, the [[Tay Rail Bridge|Tay Bridge]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Whyte, A. J. MacDonald and C. Baxter, ''John Fowler, Benjamin Baker, Forth Bridge'' (Axel Menges, 2nd edn., 1997), {{ISBN|3-930698-18-8}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was taken over by [[John Fowler (engineer)|John Fowler]] (1817–98) and [[Benjamin Baker (engineer)|Benjamin Baker]] (1840–1907), who designed a structure that was built by Glasgow-based company [[Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.]] from 1883. It was opened on 4 March 1890, and spans a total length of {{convert|2528.7|m}}. It was the first major structure in Britain to be constructed of steel;&lt;ref name="Blanctal"&gt;A. Blanc, M. McEvoy and R. Plank, ''Architecture and Construction in Steel'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993), {{ISBN|0-419-17660-8}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; its contemporary, the [[Eiffel Tower]] was built of [[wrought iron]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Impact==

===Population and urbanisation===
{{Main|Demographic history of Scotland}}
[[File:Glasgow map 1878.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Glasgow, the "second city of the Empire", in 1878]]
The census conducted by the Reverend [[Alexander Webster]] in 1755 showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The "Ill Years" of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7486-3887-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;123–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the first [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal census]] in 1801, the population was 1,608,420. It grew steadily in the nineteenth century, to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Cairncross, ''The Scottish Economy: A Statistical Account of Scottish Life by Members of the Staff of Glasgow University'' (Glasgow: Glasgow University Press, 1953), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

While population fell in some rural areas as a result of the agricultural revolution, it rose rapidly in the towns. Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow all grew by a third or more between 1755 and 1775 and the textile town of Paisley more than doubled its population.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ferguson, ''The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest'' (1998) [https://www.questia.com/read/54868029 online edition].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, 17 per cent of people in Scotland lived in towns of more than 10,000 inhabitants. By 1850 it was 32 per cent and by 1900 it was 50 per cent. By 1900 one in three of the entire population were in the four cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp411-2"/&gt;

Glasgow emerged as the largest city. Its population in 1780 was 43,000, reaching 147,000 by 1820; by 1901 it had grown to 762,000. This was due to a high birth rate and immigration from the countryside and particularly from Ireland; but from the 1870s there was a fall in the birth rate and lower rates of migration and much of the growth was due to longer life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp411-2"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, pp. 411–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow was now one of the largest cities in the world, and it became known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. MacKenzie, "The second city of the Empire: Glasgow – imperial municipality", in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, ''Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7190-6497-X}}, pp. 215–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravestone of William Beattie and family.JPG|thumb|right|Evidence of high infant mortality on an Edinburgh gravestone]]
[[History of Dundee|Dundee]] upgraded its harbour and established itself as an industrial and trading centre. Dundee's industrial heritage was based on "the three Js": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the nineteenth century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America. However, the profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade. The reasons were that low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important natural resources; thus the Dundee region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.&lt;ref&gt;B. Lenman and Kathleen Donaldson, "Partners' Incomes, Investment and Diversification in the Scottish Linen Area 1850–1921", ''Business History'', Jan 1971, vol. 13(1), pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Lee, ''Scotland and the United Kingdom: the Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7190-4101-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates were high compared with England and other European nations. Evidence suggests a national death rate of 30 per 1,000 in 1755, 24 in the 1790s and 22 in the early 1860s. Mortality tended to be much higher in urban than rural settlements. The first time these were measured, 1861–82, in the four major cities these were 28.1 per 1,000 and 17.9 in rural areas. Mortality probably peaked in Glasgow in the 1840s, when large inflows of population from the Highlands and Ireland combined population outgrowing sanitary provision and combining with outbreaks of epidemic disease. National rates began to fall in the 1870s, particularly in the cities, as environmental conditions improved.&lt;ref&gt;M. Anderson, "Population patterns: 2 since 1770, in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-19-969305-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;489–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.&lt;ref&gt;J. Melling, "Employers, industrial housing and the evolution of company welfare policies in Britain's heavy industry: west Scotland, 1870–1920", ''International Review of Social History'', Dec 1981, vol. 26 (3), pp. 255–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class identity===
[[File:Carron Company trademark.jpg|thumb|left|The Carron Company trademark on the Carron Works, the objective of the 1820 [[Radical War]]]]
One of the consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation was the development of a distinct skilled [[working class]]. W. H. Fraser argues that the emergence of a class identity can be located to the period before the 1820s, when cotton workers in particular were involved in a series of political protests and events. This led to the [[Radical War]] of 1820, in which a declaration of a provisional government by three weavers coincided with a strike by Glasgow cotton workers. The climax of the five-day war was a march from [[Glasgow Green]] to [[Falkirk]] to take control of the [[Carron Company|Carron Iron Works]]. It ended in a cavalry charge by government forces at [[Bonnymuir]]. The result was a discouragement of direct political action by workers, although attempts at political reform continued in movements like [[Chartism]] and the [[Eight-hour day|short hours]] movement in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp390-1"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, pp. 390–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1830s the political influence of the working classes was expanded through the widening of the franchise, industrial action and the growth and organisation of trade unionism. There were less than 5,000 eligible voters in Scotland before the [[Reform Act 1832|1832 Reform Act]] saw the enlargement of the franchise to include middle class men of business. The [[Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868|1868 Act]] brought in skilled artisans and that of [[Representation of the People Act 1884|1884]] admitted many farm workers, crofters, miners and unskilled men. These changes were supported by trade unions,&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed from the mid-century. Concerted industrial action was undertaken by spinners in the cotton industry in 1836-7 after a collapse of foreign markets led to wage cuts, but was ultimately defeated by the factory owners. The most sustained industrial action was in the mining industry, where the owners controlled employment as well as housing and retail trade through the [[truck system]]. In 1887 colliers in the west of Scotland won a major victory over both wages and rents.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, pp. 86–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish trade unionism in the nineteenth century differed from that in the rest of Britain in that unions were often small and highly localised and lacked higher industrial and national organisation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kenefick, ''Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872–1932'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748625186}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade councils were established in Edinburgh in 1853 and in Glasgow in 1858 in an attempt to organise on a regional basis, but were often ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[new unionism]] of the last two decades of the century saw the dockers and railwaymen organise a network of regional and national support, but this began to wain towards the end of the century and the situation of union parochialism would remain the dominant mode until union amalgamations got under way after 1914.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kenefick, ''Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872–1932'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748625186}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
[[File:Powerloom weaving in 1835.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of power loom weaving in 1835, showing an idealised view of women working in a clean and spacious environment]]
The industrialisation of Scotland had a major impact of the roles of women. Women and girls formed a much higher proportion of the workforce than elsewhere in Britain and were the majority of workers in some industries. The expansion of flax spinning and the rise of linen industry in the eighteenth century was almost totally dependent on female labour and the situation was similar in the [[sewed muslin]] industry in the West of Scotland towards the end of the century. When flax spinning became mechanised the proportion of men to women was 100:280, the highest proportion of women in the United Kingdom. In Dundee in the 1840s, while male employment increased by a factor of 1.6, female employment went up by 2.5, making it the only large town in Scotland with the majority of its female population in paid employment. In cotton in the nineteenth century women and girls accounted for 61 per cent of the workforce in Scottish mills, compared with 50 per cent in Lancashire. Although most women were employed in the textile industries, they were also a significant proportion of the workforce in other areas, making up 12 per cent of underground workers in mining, compared with 4 per cent in Britain overall.&lt;ref name=Whatley1997pp74-5&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0521576431}}, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The expanded opportunities for women, and the extra income they and children brought into the household, probably did the most to help increase living standards for working-class families.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0521576431}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in workforce peaked in the 1830s. As heavy industry began to dominate there were less opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=Whatley1997pp74-5/&gt; From the mid-nineteenth century there were a series of laws that limited female roles in industry, beginning with the Mines Regulation Act of 1842, which prevented them from working underground. This put 2,500 women out of work in the east of Scotland, causing real hardship as their contribution to the family economy was vital. This was followed by a series of factory acts that placed restrictions on the employment of women. Many of these acts were brought in because of pressure from trade unions who were attempting to secure a living wage for their male members. Women had relatively little involvement in official trade unions for much of the period of industrialisation. However, they were frequently involved in unofficial disputes, the first being recorded in 1768 and of which there are known to have been 300 strikes that involved women between 1850 and 1914. Towards the end of the century there were increasing attempts to unionise women. The Scottish Women's Trade Council (SWTC) was formed in 1887. From this emerged the [[Women's Protective and Provident League]] (WPPL) and the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades (GCWT). In 1893, the National Federal Council of Scotland for Women's Trades (NFCSWT) was established and the Scottish Council for Women's Trades (SCWT) in 1900. By 1895 the NFCSWT alone had an affiliated membership of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Brown, "Women: 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0199234825}}, pp. 647–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration===
[[File:Scottish poster advertising emigration to New Zealand.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"First Scottish Colony for New Zealand" – 1839 poster advertising emigration from Scotland to New Zealand]]
The growth of industry resulted in the arrival of large numbers of workers from Ireland who moved into the factories and mines in the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"/&gt; Many were seasonal workers employed as [[navvies]] on the construction of docks, canals and then railways.&lt;ref name=McCarrery2001pp331-3/&gt; An estimated 60–70 per cent of colliers in Lanarkshire were Irish by the 1840s. The arrivals intensified with the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Potato famine]] of 1845.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; By the census of 1841, 126,321, or 4.6 per cent of Scotland's population, had been born in Ireland and many more were of Irish descent. Most were concentrated in the west of Scotland, and in Glasgow there were 44,000 people who were born in Ireland, 16 per cent of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;W. Knox, ''Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800–present'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0748610855}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Irish immigrants, about three quarters, were Catholic,&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"/&gt; leading to a major cultural and religious change in Scotland, but a quarter were Protestant, eventually bringing with them institutions like the [[Orange Order]] and intensifying a sectarian divide in the major cities.&lt;ref name=McCarrery2001pp331-3&gt;J. McCaffery, "Immigration, Irish", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 331–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, which with major changes in agriculture, meant that during the period 1841–1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australasia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.&lt;ref name=Houston&amp;Knox2001pxxxii&gt;R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds, ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 2001), {{ISBN|0-14-026367-5}}, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who migrated to non-European locations in the century before 1914, 44 per cent went to the US, 28 per cent to Canada, and 25 per cent to Australia and New Zealand. Other important locations included the Caribbean, India and South Africa.&lt;ref name=Harper2001pp232-4&gt;M. D. Harper, "Emigration: 4 post-1750, excluding Highlands", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 232–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were [[Scottish Canadians]] and [[Scottish American]]s as the five million remaining in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Houston&amp;Knox2001pxxxii/&gt; There was little support from the government and in the early stages many migrants agreed to [[indenture]]s, particularly to the [[thirteen colonies]], that paid for their passage and guaranteed accommodation and work for five or seven years. Later immigration was assisted by agents and societies, such as the [[Salvation Army]], [[Barnados]] and the Aberdeen Ladies Union, who often focused on the young or female immigrants.&lt;ref name=Harper2001pp232-4/&gt;{{clear}}

'''Integrated enterprise modeling''' (IEM) is an [[enterprise modeling]] method used for the admission and for the [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]] of [[Business process|processes]] both in producing enterprises and in the public area and service providers. In integrated enterprise modeling different aspects as functions and data become described in one model. Furthermore, the method supports analyses of [[business process]]es independently of the available organizational structure.

The Integrated Enterprise Modeling is developed at the ''[[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute]] for Production Systems and Design Technology (German: IPK) Berlin, Germany''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Integrierte Unternehmensmodellierung|German page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrated enterprise modeling topics==

===Base constructs===
[[Image:Generische Objektklassen der IUM 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Generic object classes of the IEM]]
[[Image:Beispielklassen.jpg|300px|thumb|Overview of the object classes product, order and resource]]
[[Image:Generisches Aktivitaetsmodell.jpg|300px|thumb|Generic activity model]]The integrated enterprise modeling (IEM) method uses an [[Object orientated|object-oriented]] approach and adapts this for the enterprise description. An application-oriented division of all elements of an enterprise forms the core of the method in generic object classes ''"product"'', ''"resource"'' and ''"order"''.

;Product

The object class "product" represents all objects whose production and sale are the aim of the looked-at-enterprise as well as all objects which flow into the end product. Raw materials, intermediate products, components and end products as well as services and the describing data are included.

;Order

The object class "order" describes all types of a commissioning in the enterprise. The objects of the class "order" represent the information which is relevant from the point of view of planning, control and supervision of the enterprise processes. One understands by it what, when, at which objects, in whose responsibility and with which resources it will be executed.

;Resource

The IEM class "resource" contains all necessary key players which are required in the enterprise for the execution or support of activities. Among other things these are employees, business partner, all kinds of documents as well as information systems or operating supplies.

The classes "product", "order", and "resource" can gradually be given full particulars and specified. Through this it is possible to show both line of business typical and enterprise specific product, order and resource subclasses. Structures (e.g. parts lists or organisation charts) can be shown as relational features of the classes with the help of being-part-of- and consists-of-relations between different subclasses.

; Action

The activities which are necessary for the production of products and to the provision of services can be described as follows: an activity is the purposeful change of objects. The aim orientation of the activities causes an explicit or implicit planning and control. The execution of the activities is incumbent by the capable key players. From these considerations the definitions can be derived for the following constructs:
* An ''action'' is an object neutral description of activities: a verbal description of a work task, a lawsuit or proceeding;
* A ''function'' describes the change of state of a defined status into another defined one of objects of a class by using an action;
* An ''activity'' specifies necessary resources for the state transformation of objects of a class the controlling order described by a function and these for the execution of this transformation in the enterprise, in each case represented by an object state description.

===Views===
All modeled data of the looked-at-enterprise are recorded in the model core of an Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM) model in two main [[View model|views]]:
* the "[[information model]]" and
* the "[[business process model]]".
All relevant objects of an enterprise, their qualities and relations are shown in the "information model". It is class trees of the object classes "product", "order" and "resource" here. The "business process model" represents enterprise processes and their relations to each other. Activities are shown in their interaction with the objects.

===Process modeling===
The structuring of the enterprise processes in Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is reached by its hierarchical subdivision with the help of the decomposition. Decomposition means the reduction of a system in a partial system which respectively contains components which are in a logical cohesion. The process modeling is a partitioning of processes into its threads. Every thread describes a task completed into itself. The [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] of single processes can be carried out long enough until the threads are manageable, i.e. appropriately small. They may turn out also not too rudimentary because a high number of detailed processes increases the complexity of a business process model. A process modeling person therefore have to find a balance between the effort complexity degree of the model and possible detailed description of the enterprise processes. A model depth generally recommends itself with at most three to four decomposition levels (model levels).

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Image:elemente 1 Sequenz.jpg|Sequential order
Image:Elemente 2 Verzweigung.jpg|Parallel branching
Image:Elemente 3 Fallunterscheidung.jpg|Case distinction
Image:Elemente 4 Zusammenfuehrung.jpg|Uniting
Image:Elemente 5 Schleife.jpg|Loop
&lt;/gallery&gt;

On a model level business process flows are represented with the aid of illustrated combination elements. There are these five basic types of combinations between the activities:
* Sequential orde: At a sequential order the activities are executed after each other.
* Parallel branching: A parallel branching means that all parallel branched activities to be executed have to be completed before the following activity can be started with. It is not necessary that the parallel activities are executed at the same time. They can be deferredly carried out, too.
* Case distinction: Decision either or. The case distinction is a branching in alternative processes depending on definition of the subsequent conditions.
* Uniting: The end of a parallel as the case may be alternative execution or also an integration of process chains is indicated by the uniting.
* Loop: A repatriation (loop, cycle) is represented by means of case distinction and uniting. The activities included in the loop are executed as long as the condition for the continuation is given.

===Modeling proceeding===
The modeling procedure for the illustration of business processes in IEM covers the following steps:
* System [[delimitation]],
* Modeling,
* Model evaluation and use,
* Model change.

The ''system delimitation'' is the base of an efficient modeling. Starting out from a conceptual formulation the area of the real system to be shown is selected and interfaces will be defined to an environment. In addition, the detail depth of the model is also determined, i.e. the depth of the hierarchical decomposition relations in the view "business process model".

The delimited real system is convicted with help of the IEM method in an abstract model. IEM is the construction of the two main positions "information model" and "business process model". The "information model" is made by the specification of the object classes to be modeled for "product", "order" and "resource" with the class structures as well as descriptive and relational features. By identification and description of functions, activities and its combination to processes the "business process model" is formed. As a general rule the construction of the "information model" follows first in which the modeling person can go back to available reference class structures. The reference classes which do not correspond to the real system or were not found to be relevant at the system delimitation are deleted. The missing relevant classes are inserted. After the object base is fixed, the activities and functions are joined together at the objects according to the "generic activity model" and with the help of combination elements to business processes. A model is made which can be analysed and changed if it's required. It often happens, that during the construction of the "business process model" new relevant object classes are identified so that the class trees getting completed. The construction of the two positions is therefore an iterative process.

Afterwards weak points and improvement potentials can be identified in the course of the ''model evaluation''. This can cause the ''model changes'' whose realization should clear the weak points and make use of the improvement potentials in the real system.

===Modeling tool MO²GO===
The software tool MO²GO (method for an object-oriented business process optimization) supports the modeling process based on the integrated enterprise modeling (IEM). Different analyses of a given model are available like the planning and implementation of information systems. The MO²GO system is expandable easily and makes a high-speed modeling approach possible.

The currently used MO²GO system consists of the following components:
* MO²GO version 2.4: This component offers modeling functions for class structures, process chains and mechanism for analysis of IEM.
* MO²GO Macro editor version 2.1 : The macro editor supports the outline of MO²GO [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for user-defined evaluation procedures.
* MO²GO Viewer version 1.07 : The Java-based and licence free MO²GO Viewer is a user interface to be used easily to navigate process chains through MO²GO.
* MO²GO XML converter version 1.0 : Nowadays the IT implementation works mainly with [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagrams. MO²GO supports a component for a model based [[Xml|XML]] file which can be imported in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools.
* MO²GO Web publisher version 2.0 : The web Publisher is a mechanism of analysis to be started directly out of MO²GO 2.4. A process assistant is the result of the evaluation of the model contents based on texture and [[hyperlink]] representation. To be able to adapt the process assistant to the user requirements flexibly, the web Publisher contains a configuration component.

===MO²GO process assistant===
[[Image:screenshot prozessassistent.jpg|300px|thumb|Prozess assistant]]
The IEM business process models contain much information which can not only be used by system analysts but also be helpful for the employees at their daily work. To provide this model information for the staff and to enable the participation of the employees for the results of the modeling, a special tool was developed at the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] IPK. This is a web based process assistant whose contents are generated automatically from the IEM business process model of the enterprise. The process assistant provides all users the information of the business process model in a [[Html|HTML]] based form by intranet of the enterprise. For its implementation no special methods or tool knowledge is required besides the basic EDP and Internet experiences.

The process assistant has been developed so that the employees can find answers to the questions fast and precisely: e.g.
* What are the processes in the enterprise?
* In which way are they structured as?
* Who and with which responsibility is involved in the certain process?
* Which documents and application systems are used?

Or also:
* A certain organisation unit is involved at which processes?
* Or in which processes a certain document or an application system is used?

To make an informative process assistant from the business process model, certain modeling rules must be followed. The means e.g. that the individual actions must be deposited with its descriptions, the responsibility of the organisation units must be indicated explicitly or the paths also must be entered to the documents in the class tree. The fulfilment of these conditions means an additional time expenditure at the modeling, if these conditions are met, all employees are able to ''"surf"'' online through the [[intranet]] with the help of the process assistant by an informative enterprise documentation. They have the possibility between a graphic view and a texture based description according to their preferences and methodical previous knowledge. The graphic view is provided by the MO²GO Viewer, a viewer tool for MO²GO models. The process assistant and the MO²GO Viewer are connected so that the graphic representation of the process looked at can be accessed context sensitively from the process assistant.

Users can call on all templates, specifications and documents for the working sequence both from the process assistant and from the MO²GO Viewer online. Therefore, the process assistant cannot only be employed for the tracing of the modeling results but also in the daily business for the training of new employees as well as execution of process steps. To improve the usability in the daily routine, the process assistant can be adapted to the needs of the users flexibility. This customization can be carried out both concerning the layout and concerning the main content emphases of the process assistant.

==Areas of application of the IEM==
Knowledge is used in organisations as a resource to render services for customers. The service preparation performs along actions which are described as processes or business processes. The analysis and improvement in dealing with knowledge presupposes a common idea about this context. An explicit description of the processes therefore is required because they represent the context for the respective knowledge contents. The process modeling represents a powerful instrument for the design and a conversion of a process-oriented [[knowledge management]]. In the context of the method of the business process-oriented [[knowledge management]] (GPO KM) developed at the [[Fraunhofer society|Fraunhofer]] IPK the method of the "integrated enterprise modeling" (IEM) is accessed. It makes it possible to be able to show, to describe, to analyse and to form organisational processes. The IEM features few object classes, is ascertainable easily understandable and fast. Furthermore, the object orientation of the IEM opens up the possibility of showing knowledge as an object class. For the knowledge-oriented modeling of the business processes according to the IEM method the relevant knowledge contents have to be specified after knowledge domains and know-how bearers and represented as resources in the business process model.

In further applications IEM is used to create models across organisations (e.g. companies)to archive a common understanding between the involved stakeholders and derive services (create software and define the ASP). In this context the object oriented basis of IEM has been used to create a common semantic across the single company models and to archive compliant enterprise models (predefined classes – terminology, model templates, etc.). The reason is that the terminology used within a model has to be understandable independent of the modeling language, see also [[SDDEM]].

'''Integrated modification methodology''' ('''IMM''') is a procedure encompassing an open set of scientific techniques for morphologically analyzing the [[built environment]] in a multiscale manner and evaluating its performance in actual states or under specific design scenarios.

The methodology is structured around a nonlinear phasing process aiming for delivering a systemic understanding of any given urban settlement, formulating the modification set-ups for improving its performance, and examining the modification strategies to transform that system. The basic assumption in IMM is the recognition of the built environment as a [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=J|date=2007|title=Complex Adaptive Systems|url=|journal=CIS Technical Report|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMM has been developed by IMMdesignlab, a research lab based at [[Polytechnic University of Milan|Politecnico di Milano]] at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC).

==History==

IMM began in 2010 as an academic research at Politecnico di Milano. That research criticized the analytical approach frequently used to study and evaluate the built environment by most of the sustainable development methods. By Recognizing the built environment as a [[Complex Adaptive System]] (CAS), IMM is urged towards a holistic simulation rather than simplifying the complex mechanisms within the cities with [[reductionism]].

In 2013, Massimo Tadi established the ''IMMdesignlab'' at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC) of the Politecnico di Milano. The purpose of the mentioned laboratory is to develop IMM through research and education.

IN 2015, ''Integrated Modification Methodology for the Sustainable Built Environment'' has been approved as an academic course in the curriculum of the ''Architectural Engineering'', an International Master Program in Politecnico di Milano.

==Background==

At its theoretical background, Integrated Modification Methodology refers to the contemporary urban development as a highly paradoxical context arisen from the social and economic significance of the cities on the one hand and their arguably negative environmental impacts on the other. Asserting the inevitably of [[urbanization]], IMM declares that the only way to overcome that paradox for the cities is to develop in a profound integration with the [[ecology]]. According to IMM, the fundamental prerequisite of ecologically [[sustainable development]] is to have a comprehensive systemic understanding of the built environment.

IMM suggests that the advancement in construction techniques, building materials quality and transportation technologies alone have not solved the complex problems of the urban life simply because such improvements are not necessarily dealing with the systemic integration. The core argument of IMM is that the performance of the city is being chiefly driven by the complex relationships subsystems rather than the independent qualities of the urban elements. Thus, it aims at portraying the systemic structure of the built environment by introducing a logical framework for modeling the linkage between the city’s static and dynamic elements.

== Methodology ==

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first2=S|date=2014|title=Transformation of an urban complex system into a more sustainable form via integrated modification methodology (I.M.M)|url=|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Investigation
# Formulation
# Modification
# Retrofitting and Optimization 
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with ''Horizontal Investigation'' in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with ''Vertical Investigation'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first=S|last2=Tadi|first2=Massimo|date=2011|title=, Sustainable urban morphology emergence via Complex Adaptive System analysis|url=|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=|pages=89–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named ''[[Key Categories]]''. In a nutshell they are types of [[emergence]] that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. 
IMM declares that the city’s functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the ''Evaluation'' step which is basically an examination of the system’s performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance, after the transformation design process occurred.

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and the urban element within the  area deduced from the Investigation phase. These critical attributes are being interpreted as the Catalysts of transformation and are to come to the designer’s use to set a contextual priority list of ''[[Design Ordering Principals]]''.

The third phase is the introduction of the modification/design scenarios to the project and advances with examining them by the exact procedure of the Investigation phase in a repetitive manner until the transformed context is predicted to be acceptable in arrangement and evaluation.

The fourth phase, Retrofitting and Optimization, is a testing process of the outcomes of the modification phase, then a local optimization by technical strategies (e.g. installing photovoltaic panels, designing green roofs, studying building orientations etc.) is initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Mohammad Zadeh|first2=Hadi|date=2014|others=Naraghi, Vahabzadeh Manesh|title=Environmental and energy performance optimization of a neighborhood in Tehran, via IMM methodology|url=|journal=International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology (IJESIT)|volume=|pages=409–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In perceiving a sequence of consecutive stimuli, subjects tend to overestimate the elapsed time between two successive stimuli when the distance between the stimuli is sufficiently large, and to underestimate the elapsed time when the distance is sufficiently small.

==In different sensory modalities==
The kappa effect can occur with visual (e.g., flashes of light), auditory (e.g., tones), or tactile (e.g. taps to the skin) stimuli. Many studies of the kappa effect have been conducted using visual stimuli. For example, suppose three light sources, X, Y, and Z, are flashed successively in the dark with equal time intervals between each of the flashes. If the light sources are placed at different positions, with X and Y closer together than Y and Z, the temporal interval between the X and Y flashes is perceived to be shorter than that between the Y and Z flashes.&lt;ref name="TAU-AND KAPPA-EFECTS"&gt;TAU- AND KAPPA-EFFECTS.

Advances in Sound Localization, 95-104&lt;/ref&gt; In touch, the kappa effect was first described as the "S-effect" by Suto (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suto|first=Y|title=The effect of space on time estimation (S-effect) in tactual space|journal=Japanese Journal of Psychology|year=1952|volume=22|pages=45–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; refers to the kappa effect as "perceptual time dilation" in analogy with the physical [[time dilation]] of the [[theory of relativity]].

==Theories based in velocity expectation==
Physically, traversed space and elapsed time are linked by velocity. Accordingly, several theories regarding the brain's expectations about stimulus velocity have been put forward to account for the kappa effect.

===Constant velocity expectation===
According to the constant velocity hypothesis proposed by Jones and Huang (1982), the brain incorporates a prior expectation of speed when judging spatiotemporal intervals. Specifically, the brain expects temporal intervals that would produce constant velocity (i.e., [[Kinematics|uniform motion]]) movement.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, B. &amp; Huang, Y. L. (1982). Space-time dependencies in psychophysical judgment of extent and duration: algebraic models of the tau and kappa effects. Psychological Bulletin, 91(1), 128-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuda"&gt;Masuda, T., Kimura, A., Dan, I. &amp; Wada, Y. (2011). Effects of environmental context on temporal perception bias in apparent motion" ''Vision Research'' 51, 1728-1740&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the kappa effect occurs when we apply our knowledge of motion to stimulus sequences, which sometimes leads us to make mistakes.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;Dr. Molly J. Henry, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences; Leipzig, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the role of a uniform motion expectation in temporal perception comes from a study&lt;ref name="Sarrazin"&gt;Sarrazin, J. C., Giraudo, M. D., Pailhous, J., &amp; Bootsma, R. (2004). Dynamics of balancing space and time in memory: tau and kappa effects revisited. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 30(3), 411-430,&lt;/ref&gt; in which participants observed eight white dots that successively appeared in one direction in a horizontal alignment along a straight line. When the temporal separation was constant and the spatial separation between the dots varied, they observed the kappa effect, which follows the constant velocity hypothesis. However, when both the temporal and spatial separation between the dots varied, they failed to observe the response pattern that the constant velocity hypothesis predicts. A possible explanation is that it is difficult to perceive a uniform motion from such varying, complicated patterns; thus, the context of observed events may affect our temporal perception.

===Low-speed expectation===
A [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] perceptual model&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|title=A Bayesian perceptual model replicates the cutaneous rabbit and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Mar 28, 2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=e333|pmid=17389923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000333|pmc=1828626}}&lt;/ref&gt; replicates the tactile kappa effect and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions, including the tau effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]]. According to this model, brain circuitry encodes the expectation that tactile stimuli tend to move slowly. The Bayesian model reaches an optimal probabilistic inference by combining uncertain spatial and temporal sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speed movement. The expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly results in the perceptual overestimation of the time elapsed between rapidly successive taps applied to separate skin locations. Simultaneously, the model perceptually underestimates the spatial separation between stimuli, thereby reproducing the cutaneous rabbit illusion and the tau effect. Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; speculated that a Bayesian slow-speed prior might explain the visual kappa effect as well the tactile one. Recent empirical studies support this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Youguo|last2=Zhang|first2=Bangwu|last3=Kording|first3=Konrad Paul|authorlink3=Konrad Kording|last4=Luo|first4=Wenbo|title=Speed Constancy or Only Slowness: What Drives the Kappa Effect|journal=PLOS ONE|date=21 April 2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0154013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0154013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuroda|first1=Tsuyoshi|last2=Grondin|first2=Simon|last3=Miyazaki|first3=Makoto|last4=Ogata|first4=Katsuya|last5=Tobimatsu|first5=Shozo|title=The Kappa Effect With Only Two Visual Markers|journal=Multisensory Research|date=31 October 2016|volume=29|issue=8|pages=703–725|doi=10.1163/22134808-00002533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion in different contexts===
The kappa effect appears to depend strongly on phenomenal rather than physical extent.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; The kappa effect gets bigger as stimuli move faster.&lt;ref name="Masuda"/&gt; Observers tend to apply their previous knowledge of motion to a sequence of stimuli. When subjects observed vertically arranged stimuli, the kappa effect was stronger for sequences moving downward. This can be attributed to the expectation of downward acceleration and upward deceleration, in that the perceived accelerated downward motion causes us to underestimate temporal separation judgments.

==Related illusions==
If observers interpret rapid stimulus sequences in light of an expectation regarding velocity, then it would be expected that not only temporal, but also spatial illusions would result. This indeed occurs in the [[tau effect]], when the spatial separation between stimuli is constant and the temporal separation is varied. In this case, the observer decreases the judgment of spatial separation as temporal separation decreases, and vice versa. For example, when equally spaced light sources X, Y, and Z are flashed successively in the dark with a shorter time between X and Y than between Y and Z, X and Y are perceived to be closer together in space than are Y and Z.&lt;ref name="TAU-AND KAPPA-EFECTS" /&gt; Goldreich (2007) &lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; linked the tau and kappa effects to the same underlying expectation regarding movement speed. He noted that, when stimuli move rapidly across space, "perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events".&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; termed these two fundamental perceptual distortions "perceptual length contraction" (tau effect) and "perceptual time dilation" (kappa effect) in analogy with the physical [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]] of the [[theory of relativity]]. Perceptual length contraction and perceptual time dilation result from the same Bayesian observer model, one that expects stimuli to move slowly.&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; Analogously, in the theory of relativity, length contraction and time dilation both occur when a physical speed ([[Speed of light|the speed of light]]) cannot be exceeded.

'''Kleinjena''' is situated 4 kilometres north of Naumburg on a long spur at the foot of the Finne mountain range above the village of Kleinjena, at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanscape around Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Landscape around Neuenburg]]

== World Heritage Nomination ==
The castle of Kleinjena is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. As Kleinjena marks the starting point for the vast growth of the region in the [[12th century]], it is indispensable for an understanding of the history of this [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The castle of Kleinjena was built by the influential [[Ekkehard]]ine dynasty. This dynasty owned estates in the old settlement area in the northern part of [[Thuringia]] and in the area of the conﬂuence of the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]. The family seat was the castle of Gene, which was situated south of the Unstrut River in the former diocese of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Ekkehardiner, Markgrafen von Meißen und ihre Beziehungen zum Reich und zu den Piasten (= Europäische Hochschulschriften. Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften. Bd. 691).|trans-title=The Ekkerhardines, margraves of Meißen and their relations in the empire (European university publications. Number 3: History and related sciences. Bd. 691.|author=Rupp, Gabriele|publisher=Lang|date=1996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Ottonian]] [[palace]]s or imperial [[castles]] of the time, the castle complex of Ekkehard I was a segmented complex with two ramparts on a ﬂat spur. Its main rampart and the related trench have ﬂattened to a great extent, but they are still clearly visible in the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mitteldeutsche Geschichte. Sachsen - Sachsen-Anhalt - Thüringen.|trans-title=Central German history. Saxony - Saxony-Anhalt-Thuringia|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Edition Leipzig|date=2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the murder of [[Ekkehard I]], the site was gradually abandoned as the margravial brothers Hermann and Ekkehard II transferred their family seatfrom Kleinjena to Naumburg (Nuenburch), first mentioned in the records in 1012.

[[File:Certificate Emperor Conrad.tif|thumb|Certificate Emperor Conrad]]
Encouraged by a privilege granted by [[Emperor Conrad II]] in 1033, also the merchants of Kleinjena moved to Naumburg, since they were guaranteed free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile. The comparative advantage of Naumburg was also a topographical one as that the descent of the long-distance routes coming from the plateau was not as steep as in Kleinjena and Grossjena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geschichte Thüringens|trans-title=History of Thuringia|pages=15–79|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Beck|date=2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
These archeologically documented remains of the [[castle]] of the [[Margraves of Meissen|Markgraves of Meißen]], the Ekkehardines, date back to the [[10th century]].  At the European level, these preserved structures are an early evidence of the efforts undertaken by the high nobility to impose its centre of power through large-scale fortifications that eventually served as their memorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Burgen der Ekkehardinger an der Unstrutmündung(1.

'''L. Bancel LaFarge''' (1900-1989) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]].  He was a founding member of the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref name="nyt1989obit"&gt;Flint, Peter B. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/04/obituaries/l-b-la-farge-89-an-architect.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bancel%20laFarge&amp;st=cse  "L. B. La Farge, 89, an Architect,"] ''New York Times.'' July 4, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Louis Bancel LaFarge was born into a prominent American family. His grandfather, [[John LaFarge]], was a noted American artist. His grandmother was a granddaughter of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and a direct descendant of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890279-1,00.html  "Religion: Reasoned Optimist,"] ''Time.'' March 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Bancel LaFarge, was an artist who continued his father's work in glass,&lt;ref name="mfaa"&gt;Monuments Men Foundation: [http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/ Monuments Men] LaFarge, Maj. L. Bancel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Time.'' March 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother Tom was a mural painter.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T. ''Emigrés in the Wilderness''. New York: Macmilland, 1941, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaFarge was a graduate of [[Harvard College]] and the [[Yale School of Architecture]].&lt;ref name="mfaa"/&gt; He married Margaret Hockaday, with whom he had three children: Timothy, Benjamin, and Celestine.

==Career==
LaFarge established himself as an architect in New York specializing in domestic architecture.  His practice was interrupted by military service in the Second World War.  At war's end, he returned to his work as an architect. At one time he served as president of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1958-1960), and he was a founding member of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (1965–70).&lt;ref name="nyt1989obit"/&gt;

==World War II==
Major LaFarge was assigned to the 7th Army in Europe during the Second World War.  He was the Chief of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives]] (MFAA) section.  LaFarge was the first MFAA officer to arrive in France after [[D-Day]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="mfaa"/&gt;

'''Laurie L. Patton''' (born November 14, 1961) is an [[Americans|American]] academic, author and poet who serves as the 17th President of [[Middlebury College]]. Previously, she was the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Early Indian Religions at [[Emory University]] before assuming the role of Robert F. Durden Professor of Religion and Dean of Arts and Sciences at [[Duke University]].

Patton was named Middlebury's 17th President on  November 18, 2014, and became Middlebury's first woman president upon taking office on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/help/mediaserv/stream&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2008-12-01 |title=Mumbai is Not 9/11 |first=Laurie |last=Patton |newspaper=Religious Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604090208/http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |archivedate=June 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton graduated from [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] in Wallingford, Connecticut, holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], a doctorate from the [[University of Chicago]], and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 2000. She focuses her research on early Indian rituals, narrative and mythology, literary theory in religious studies, and [[Hinduism]] in modern India. She has published on the interpretation of early Indian ritual and narrative, comparative mythology, literary theory in the study of religion, women and Hinduism in contemporary India, and religion and conflict.

Her early Indological work applies literary theory and theory of canon to the texts of early India, particularly Vedic texts. Later, she used a theory of metonymy to rethink the application of mantras in early Indian ritual.  Her first edited work, ''Authority, Anxiety, and Canon'' (1994) surveyed the larger field of Vedic interpretation as it existed in various intellectual contexts throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1849-authority-anxiety-and-canon.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

She was co-editor on ''Myth and Method'' an assessment of the state of the field in comparative mythology. Her co-edited work with Edwin Bryant (2005) brings together for the first time a variety of differing perspectives on the problem of Aryan origins.

Patton has also worked on gender questions, beginning with her edited volume, ''Jewels of Authority'' (2002), which examined early feminist stereotypes about women in Indian textual traditions as well as contemporary life.  Her recent articles on gender are derived from her present project, the first ethnography of women Sanskritists ever to be undertaken in India.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Her translation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' in the [[Penguin Classics]] Series follows a free verse style constrained by eight line stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stainton|first1=Hamsa|title=Review: The Bhagavad Gita|url=http://www.saglobalaffairs.com/book-reviews/191-review-the-bhagavad-gita.html|website=SAGlobalAffairs.com|publisher=SAGlobalAffairs.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton regularly teaches in public venues nationally and internationally on interfaith issues, comparative religion, and religion and conflict.  In 2008–09 she co-hosted a TV series on "Faith and Feminism" for Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasting.  Patton served as Chair of the Department from 2000–07, as Co-convenor of the Religions and the Human Spirit Strategic Plan from 2005–07, and as Winship Distinguished Research Professor from 2003–06. She was the recipient of Emory’s highest award for teaching, the Emory Williams Award, in 2006. She co-convenes the Religion and Conflict Initiative at Emory University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovguide.com/laurie-l-patton-9202a8c04000641f8000000012e52aaa#&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22638">{{distinguish|MacGuffin (cipher)}}
In [[fiction]], a '''MacGuffin''' (sometimes '''McGuffin''') is a [[plot device]] in the form of some goal, desired object, or another motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no [[narrative]] explanation. The MacGuffin's importance to the plot is not the object itself, but rather its effect on the characters and their motivations.

The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially [[Thriller film|thrillers]]. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first [[Act (theater)|act]], and thereafter declines in importance. It may reappear at the climax of the story but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as '''plot coupons'''.&lt;ref name="ansible"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html |title=The Well-Tempered Plot Device |last=Lowe |first=Nick |authorlink=&lt;!-- not the comics writer (born 1979).

==History and use==
The use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name ''MacGuffin''.&lt;ref name=mward /&gt;  The [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian Legend]] has been cited as an example of an early MacGuffin, as the desired object that serves to advance the plot.&lt;ref name=mward&gt;Dr. Marjory T. Ward, "King Arthur Revisited" in Dr. Andrew Keen (ed.) "Proceedings of the Second History/Literature Conference on Medieval Literature"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World War I]]–era actress [[Pearl White]] used ''weenie'' to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes, and often the villains as well, to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' and the other [[Movie serial#Silent era|silent film serials]] in which she starred.&lt;ref name="Lahue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bound and Gagged: The Story of the Silent Serials |first=Kalton C. |last=Lahue |year=1968 |publisher=Oak Tree Pubs |isbn=978-0-498-06762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1929 detective novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', a small [[statuette]] provides both the book's [[eponymous]] title and its motive for intrigue.

The name ''MacGuffin'' was coined by the English screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Colin|title=Whisky Galore! and the Maggie: A British Film Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-86064-633-1|p=21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215809/https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|archivedate=2017-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in the 1930s.

===Alfred Hitchcock===
The [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]] Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term ''MacGuffin'' and the technique with his 1935 film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', an early example of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall Deutelbaum |author2=Leland A. Poague |year=2009 |title=A Hitchcock reader |page=114 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Digou|first=Mike|title=Hitchcock's Macguffin In The Works Of David Mamet|journal=Literature Film Quarterly|date=October 2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' in a 1939 lecture at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, 'What's that package up there in the baggage rack?' And the other answers, 'Oh, that's a MacGuffin'. The first one asks, 'What's a MacGuffin?' 'Well,' the other man says, 'it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.' The first man says, 'But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,' and the other one answers, 'Well then, that's no MacGuffin!' So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interviewed in 1966 by [[François Truffaut]], Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' using the same story.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framing Hitchcock: Selected essays from the Hitchcock annual|publisher=Wayne State University Press Detroit|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|work=[[Google Books]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock also said, "The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=David |date=1995 |title=Perspectives on Alfred Hitchcock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqZZAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=G. K. Hall |page=31 |isbn= 9780816116034 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's term ''MacGuffin'' helped him to assert that his films were in fact not what they appeared to be on the surface.  Hitchcock also related this anecdote in a television interview for [[Richard Schickel]]'s documentary ''The Men Who Made the Movies'', and in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=cavettbiter|title=Alfred Hitchcock was confused by a laxative commercial|date=2007-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503122702/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]], a friend of Hitchcock's, may have originally coined the term, according to the author Ken Mogg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |title=Frequently asked questions on Hitchcock |author=Ken Mogg |work=labyrinth.net.au |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703212952/http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |archivedate=July 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lucas===
On the commentary soundtrack to the 2004 DVD release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', [[screenwriter|writer]] and [[film director|director]] [[George Lucas]] describes [[R2-D2]] as "the main driving force of the movie&amp;nbsp;... what you say in the movie business is the MacGuffin&amp;nbsp;... the object of everybody's search".&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;''Star Wars'' (1977) Region 2 DVD release (2004). Audio commentary, 00:14:44 – 00:15:00.&lt;/ref&gt; In TV interviews, Hitchcock defined a MacGuffin as the object around which the plot revolves, but as to what that object ''specifically'' is, he declared, "The audience don't care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |title=The 39 Steps – Film (Movie) Plot and Review |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193532/http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lucas believes that the MacGuffin should be powerful and that "the audience should care about it almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |title=Keys to the Kingdom |date=February 2008 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193209/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yves Lavandier===
For the filmmaker and drama writing theorist [[Yves Lavandier]], in the strictly Hitchcockian sense, a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |title=Excerpts from Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118203139/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |archivedate=January 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[North by Northwest]]''{{'}}s supposed MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the alleged MacGuffins of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''. In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflictual premises of a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |title=Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113150601/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- Please don't add an example without a reliable source explicitly calling it a MacGuffin. Google Books might be of help. Also, please limit examples unless an existing one can be replaced by a much better one. The point of MacGuffins is that they are a very common device. This is a list of *examples*, not an exhaustive run-down of every work that has one.--&gt;
Alfred Hitchcock popularized the use of the MacGuffin technique.&lt;ref name=FreeDictionary&gt;{{cite dictionary | url = https://www.thefreedictionary.com/MacGuffin | title = MacGuffin | work = The Free Dictionary | publisher = Farlex, Inc. | date = | access-date = 7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from Hitchcock's films include plans for a silent plane engine in ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', radioactive uranium ore in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and a clause from a secret peace treaty in ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''.&lt;ref name="Walker2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Michael|title=Hitchcock's Motifs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWhZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297|accessdate=2 September 2017|year=2005|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5356-773-9|page=297|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215808/https://books.google.com/books?id=OWhZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297|archivedate=24 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other films have also deployed this technique; for example, the Maltese Falcon in the [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|1941 film of the same name]], the meaning of "Rosebud" in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/citi.html |website=Filmsite.org |title=Greatest Films: Citizen Kane (1941) |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312003503/http://www.filmsite.org/citi.html |archivedate=March 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Heart of the Ocean]] necklace in 1997's ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=April 4, 2012 |title=TIME's Titanic 3D Review |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/04/titanic-time-and-me/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191147/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/04/04/titanic-time-and-me/ |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the letters of transit in ''[[Casablanca]]'' (1942 film),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.purpleclover.com/entertainment/6617-classic-movie-mcguffins/item/letterscasablanca-mcguffins/|website=purpleclover.com |title=The Letters of Transit in 'Casablanca' | accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Rabbit's Foot" in ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.observer.com/node/38831 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106064328/http://www.observer.com/node/38831 |archivedate=November 6, 2007 |title=What the MacGuffin?

To emphasize how the nature of the MacGuffin is not important, in the film ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' (1998) the MacGuffin is a metallic briefcase whose contents are never revealed.&lt;ref name="Nadel2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nadel|first=Ira|authorlink=Ira Nadel|title=David Mamet: A Life in the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVddAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT344|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=16 July 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37873-5|pages=344–3345}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example is the briefcase shown throughout ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), in which the glowing contents of the briefcase are never revealed, despite being violently coveted by many major characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chernov |first1=Matthew |title=‘Pulp Fiction’ at 20: Why It’s the Coolest Film of the ’90s |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/pulp-fiction-at-20-what-makes-it-the-coolest-film-of-the-90s-1201328795/ |accessdate=16 November 2018 |work=Variety |date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the mixed critical reception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), the primary criticism was that the [[crystal skull]] in the film was seen as an unsatisfying MacGuffin. The director [[Steven Spielberg]] said, "I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Steven Spielberg admits he had reservations about 'Indiana Jones 4,' but still defends worst scene in 'Indiana Jones 4' |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193750/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an essential mineral [[nutrient]] (i.e., element) for life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnesium (In Biological Systems)|journal=Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia|date=2006|doi=10.1002/0471743984.vse4741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leroy 1926"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Leroy| first=J.| year=1926| title=Necessite du magnesium pour la croissance de la souris| journal=Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société de Biologie| volume=94| pages= 431–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lusk 1968"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lusk| first=J.E.|author2=Williams, R.J.P. |author3=Kennedy, E.P. | year=1968| title=Magnesium and the growth of Escherichia coli| journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume=243| pages=2618–2624| pmid=4968384| issue=10 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/243/10/2618.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"&gt;{{cite book| last=Marschner| first= H.| year=1995| title=Mineral Nutrition in Higher Plants| location=San Diego| publisher= Academic Press| isbn=0-12-473542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is present in every [[cell (biology)|cell]] type in every organism. For example, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must bind to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP.&lt;ref name="cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225194451/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?magnesium|title=Definition: magnesium from Online Medical Dictionary|date=25 December 2007|website=Archive.org|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, magnesium plays a role in the stability of all [[polyphosphate]] compounds in the cells, including those associated with the synthesis of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].

Over 300 [[enzyme]]s require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including ''all'' enzymes utilizing or synthesizing ATP, or those that use other [[nucleotide]]s to synthesize DNA and RNA. [cite needed]

In plants, magnesium is necessary for synthesis of [[chlorophyll]] and [[photosynthesis]].

==Function==
A balance of magnesium is vital to the well-being of all organisms. Magnesium is a relatively abundant ion in Earth's crust and mantle and is highly bioavailable in the [[hydrosphere]].  This availability, in combination with a useful and very unusual chemistry, may have led to its utilization in evolution as an ion for signaling, enzyme activation, and [[catalysis]].  However, the unusual nature of ionic magnesium has also led to a major challenge in the use of the ion in biological systems.  Biological membranes are impermeable to magnesium (and other ions), so transport proteins must facilitate the flow of magnesium, both into and out of cells and intracellular compartments.

Chlorophyll in plants converts water to oxygen as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  [[Hemoglobin]] in vertebrate animals transports oxygen as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the blood. Chlorophyll is very similar to hemoglobin, except magnesium is at the center of the chlorophyll molecule and iron is at the center of the hemoglobin molecule, with other variations.&lt;ref&gt;Granick S, Evolution of Heme and Chlorophyll in book, Bryson V, HJ Vogel, ed., Evolving Genes and Proteins.  Academic Press, NY and London, 1965, pp. 67-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process keeps living cells on earth alive and maintains baseline levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in our atmosphere.

{{Further|Magnesium deficiency}}

Inadequate magnesium intake frequently causes muscle [[spasm]]s, and has been associated with [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], [[anxiety]] disorders, [[migraine]]s, [[osteoporosis]], and [[cerebral infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;

The most common symptom of excess oral magnesium intake is [[diarrhea]]. Supplements based on [[amino acid]] [[chelates]] (such as [[glycinate]], [[lysinate]] etc.) are much better-tolerated by the [[digestive system]] and do not have the [[side-effects]] of the older compounds used, while [[sustained-release]] [[dietary supplements]] prevent the occurrence of diarrhea.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Since the kidneys of adult humans excrete excess magnesium efficiently, oral magnesium poisoning in adults with normal [[renal function]] is very rare. Infants, which have less ability to excrete excess magnesium even when healthy, should not be given magnesium supplements, except under a physician's care.

[[Magnesium (pharmaceutical preparation)|Pharmaceutical preparations with magnesium]] are used to treat conditions including [[magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium deficiency]] and [[hypomagnesemia]], as well as [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=Euser2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Euser | first1 = A.

Magnesium is absorbed with reasonable efficiency (30% to 40%) by the body from any soluble magnesium salt, such as the chloride or citrate. Magnesium is similarly absorbed from [[Epsom salts]], although the sulfate in these salts adds to their laxative effect at higher doses. Magnesium absorption from the insoluble oxide and hydroxide salts ([[milk of magnesia]]) is erratic and of poorer efficiency, since it depends on the neutralization and solution of the salt by the acid of the stomach, which may not be (and usually is not) complete.

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and [[Recommended Dietary Allowances]] (RDAs) for magnesium in 1997. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EARs for magnesium for women and men ages 31 and up are 265&amp;nbsp;mg/day and 350&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 320 and 420&amp;nbsp;mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 350 to 400&amp;nbsp;mg/day depending on age of the woman. RDA for lactation ranges 310 to 360&amp;nbsp;mg/day for same reason. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 65 to 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of magnesium the UL is set at 350&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The UL is specific to magnesium consumed as a dietary supplement, the reason being that too much magnesium consumed at one time can cause diarrhea. The UL does not apply to food-sourced magnasium. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK109816/ "Magnesium"], pp.190-249 in "Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride". National Academy Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set at 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation are also 300&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 170 to 250&amp;nbsp;mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 250&amp;nbsp;mg/day - lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnesium UL is unique in that it is lower than some of the RDAs. It applies to intake from a pharmacological agent or dietary supplement only, and does not include intake from food and water.

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value (%DV). For magnesium labeling purposes 100% of the daily value was 400&amp;nbsp;mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 420&amp;nbsp;mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates|title=Labeling &amp; Nutrition - Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|website=www.FDA.gov|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food sources ==
[[Image:FoodSourcesOfMagnesium.jpg|upright|thumb|Some good sources of magnesium]]
[[Green vegetable]]s such as [[spinach]] provide magnesium because of the abundance of [[chlorophyll]] molecules, which contain the ion. [[Nut (fruit)|Nut]]s (especially [[Brazil nut]]s, [[cashew]]s and [[almond]]s), [[seed]]s (e.g., [[pumpkin seed]]s), [[dark chocolate]], roasted [[soybean]]s, [[bran]], and some [[whole grain]]s are also good sources of magnesium.&lt;ref name="foods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/foods-high-in-magnesium.php|title=Top 10 Foods Highest in Magnesium + Printable One Page Sheet|website=HealthAliciousNess|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many foods contain magnesium, it is usually found in low levels. As with most nutrients, daily needs for magnesium are unlikely to be met by one serving of any single food. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains will help ensure adequate intake of magnesium.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Because magnesium readily dissolves in water, refined foods, which are often processed or cooked in water and dried, in general, are poor sources of the nutrient. For example, [[whole-wheat bread]] has twice as much magnesium as white bread because the magnesium-rich germ and bran are removed when white flour is processed. The table of food sources of magnesium suggests many dietary sources of magnesium.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Hard water|"Hard" water]] can also provide magnesium, but [[Soft water|"soft" water]] contains less of the ion. Dietary surveys do not assess magnesium intake from water, which may lead to underestimating total magnesium intake and its variability.

Too much magnesium may make it difficult for the body to absorb [[calcium]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Not enough magnesium can lead to [[hypomagnesemia]] as described above, with irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure (a sign in humans but not some experimental animals such as rodents), insomnia, and muscle spasms ([[fasciculation]]).  However, as noted, symptoms of low magnesium from pure dietary deficiency are thought to be rarely encountered.

In plants, and more recently in animals, magnesium has been recognized as an important signaling ion, both activating and mediating many biochemical reactions. The best example of this is perhaps the regulation of [[carbon]] fixation in [[chloroplast]]s in the [[Calvin cycle]].&lt;ref name="Berkowitz 1993"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Berkowitz| first= G.

Magnesium is very important in cellular function.  Deficiency of the [[nutrient]] causes disease of the affected organism. In single-cell organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]], low levels of magnesium manifests in greatly reduced growth rates. In magnesium transport [[knockout]] strains of bacteria, healthy rates are maintained only with exposure to very high external concentrations of the ion.&lt;ref name="Hmiel 1989"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hmiel| first= S.

Plants deficient in magnesium show stress responses. The first observable signs of both magnesium starvation and overexposure in plants is a decrease in the rate of [[photosynthesis]].  This is due to the central position of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in the [[chlorophyll]] molecule. The later effects of magnesium deficiency on plants are a significant reduction in growth and reproductive viability.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; Magnesium can also be toxic to plants, although this is typically seen only in [[drought]] conditions.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 1987"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kaiser| first= W.

[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the chlorophyll a molecule, with the Magnesium ion (bright-green) visible at the center of the [[porphyrin]] group]]

In animals, magnesium deficiency ([[hypomagnesemia]]) is seen when the environmental availability of magnesium is low. In ruminant animals, particularly vulnerable to magnesium availability in pasture grasses, the condition is known as ‘grass tetany’. Hypomagnesemia is identified by a loss of balance due to muscle weakness.&lt;ref name="Grunes 1970"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Grunes| first= D. L.|author2=Stout, P.

Overexposure to magnesium may be toxic to individual cells, though these effects have been difficult to show experimentally.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} [[Hypermagnesemia]], an overabundance of magnesium in the blood, is usually caused by loss of [[kidney]] function. Healthy animals rapidly excrete excess magnesium in the urine and stool.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, Online Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Urinary magnesium is called ''magnesuria''. Characteristic concentrations of magnesium in model organisms are: in ''E. coli'' 30-100mM (bound), 0.01-1mM (free), in budding yeast 50mM, in mammalian cell 10mM (bound), 0.5mM (free) and in blood plasma 1mM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-concentrations-of-different-ions-in-cells/|title =Cell Biology by the Numbers: What are the concentrations of different ions in cells? |website =book.bionumbers.org|first1= Ron|last1= Milo|first2= Rob |last2=Philips|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological chemistry==
Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the fourth-most-abundant [[metal]] [[ion]] in cells (per [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s) and the most abundant free divalent cation — as a result, it is deeply and intrinsically woven into cellular [[metabolism]]. Indeed, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [[enzyme]]s appear in virtually every metabolic pathway: Specific binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to biological membranes is frequently observed, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is also used as a signalling molecule, and much of nucleic acid biochemistry requires Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, including all reactions that require release of energy from ATP.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"&gt;{{cite book| last=Cowan| first= J.

===Chlorophyll===

In photosynthetic organisms, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has the additional vital role of being the [[Coordination complex|coordinating ion]] in the [[chlorophyll]] molecule. This role was discovered by [[Richard Willstätter]], who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1915 for the purification and structure of chlorophyll.

===Enzymes===

The chemistry of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, as applied to enzymes, uses the full range of this ion’s unusual reaction chemistry to fulfill a range of functions.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black 1995a"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Black| first= C. B.|author2=Cowan, J.A.| year= 1995| title= Magnesium-dependent enzymes in nucleic acid biochemistry| work=The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium| editor=J.A.

In general, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interacts with substrates through inner sphere coordination, stabilising anions or reactive intermediates, also including binding to ATP and activating the molecule to nucleophilic attack. When interacting with enzymes and other proteins, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may bind using inner or outer sphere coordination, to either alter the conformation of the enzyme or take part in the chemistry of the catalytic reaction. In either case, because Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is only rarely fully dehydrated during ligand binding, it may be a water molecule associated with the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that is important rather than the ion itself. The [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acidity]] of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] 11.4) is used to allow both hydrolysis and condensation reactions (most common ones being phosphate ester hydrolysis and phosphoryl transfer) that would otherwise require pH values greatly removed from physiological values.

=== Essential role in the biological activity of ATP ===
[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must be bound to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP.&lt;ref name="cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Nucleic acids===

[[Nucleic acid]]s have an important range of interactions with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] stabilises structure; this can be observed in the increased melting temperature (''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of double-stranded DNA in the presence of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt; In addition, [[ribosome]]s contain large amounts of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the stabilisation provided is essential to the complexation of this ribo-protein.&lt;ref name="Sperazza 1983"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sperazza| first= J. M.|author2=Spremulli, L. L. | year=1983| title= Quantitation of cation binding to wheat germ ribosomes: influences on subunit association equilibria and ribosome activity| journal= Nucleic Acids Research| volume= 11| pages= 2665–2679| doi=10.1093/nar/11.9.2665| pmid=6856472| issue=9| pmc=325916}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of enzymes involved in the biochemistry of nucleic acids bind Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for activity, using the ion for both activation and catalysis. Finally, the autocatalysis of many [[ribozymes]] (enzymes containing only RNA) is Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent (e.g. the yeast mitochondrial group II self splicing introns&lt;ref name="Smith 1995"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Smith| first= R. L.|author2=Thompson, L.J. |author3=Maguire, M. E. | year=1995| title= Cloning and characterization of MgtE, a putative new class of Mg2+ transporter from Bacillus firmus OF4| journal= Journal of Bacteriology| volume= 177| pages= 1233–1238| pmid=7868596| issue=5| pmc=176728}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Magnesium ions can be critical in maintaining the positional integrity of closely clustered phosphate groups. These clusters appear in numerous and distinct parts of the [[cell nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]]. For instance, hexahydrated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions bind in the deep [[DNA|major groove]] and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid [[Nucleic acid double helix|duplexes]].&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/28/8/1760/1009217|title=Hexahydrated magnesium ions bind in the deep major groove and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid duplexes|first1=Howard|last1=Robinson|first2=Yi-Gui|last2=Gao|first3=Ruslan|last3=Sanishvili|first4=Andrzej|last4=Joachimiak|first5=Andrew H.-J.|last5=Wang|date=15 April 2000|publisher=|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1760–1766|access-date=17 January 2018|via=nar.OxfordJournals.org|doi=10.1093/nar/28.8.1760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell membranes and walls===

Biological [[cell membrane]]s and [[cell wall]]s are polyanionic surfaces. This has important implications for the transport of ions, in particular because it has been shown that different membranes preferentially bind different ions.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt; Both Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regularly stabilize membranes by the cross-linking of [[Carboxylation|carboxylated]] and [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] head groups of lipids. However, the envelope membrane of ''[[E. coli]]'' has also been shown to bind Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The transport of ions is dependent on both the concentration gradient of the ion and the electric potential (ΔΨ) across the membrane, which will be affected by the charge on the membrane surface. For example, the specific binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to the [[chloroplast]] envelope has been implicated in a loss of photosynthetic efficiency by the blockage of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake and the subsequent acidification of the chloroplast stroma.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz 1993"/&gt;

===Proteins===

The Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion tends to bind only weakly to [[protein]]s ([[Acid dissociation constant|''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] ≤ 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt;) and this can be exploited by the cell to switch [[enzymatic]] activity on and off by changes in the local concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Although the concentration of free cytoplasmic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, the total Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content of animal cells is 30&amp;nbsp;mmol/L&lt;ref name="Ebel 1980"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ebel| first= H.|author2=Gunther, T. | year= 1980| title= Magnesium metabolism: a review| journal= Journal of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Biochemistry| volume= 18| pages= 257–270| doi=10.1515/cclm.1980.18.5.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in plants the content of leaf endodermal cells has been measured at values as high as 100&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990), much of which buffered in storage compartments. The cytoplasmic concentration of free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is buffered by binding to [[Chelation|chelators]] (e.g., ATP), but also, what is more important, by storage of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in intracellular compartments. The transport of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; between intracellular compartments may be a major part of regulating enzyme activity. The interaction of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with proteins must also be considered for the transport of the ion across biological membranes.

===Manganese===

In biological systems, only [[manganese]] (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is readily capable of replacing Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but only in a limited set of circumstances. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is very similar to Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in terms of its chemical properties, including inner and outer shell complexation. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; effectively binds ATP and allows hydrolysis of the energy molecule by most ATPases. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can also replace Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as the activating ion for a number of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent enzymes, although some enzyme activity is usually lost.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt; Sometimes such enzyme metal preferences vary among closely related species: For example, the [[reverse transcriptase]] enzyme of [[lentivirus]]es like [[HIV]], [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] and [[FIV]] is typically dependent on Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the analogous enzyme for other [[retrovirus]]es prefers Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Importance in drug binding ===
An article&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35101544|year=2001|last1=Schlünzen|first1=Frank|last2=Zarivach|first2=Raz|last3=Harms|first3=Jörg|last4=Bashan|first4=Anat|last5=Tocilj|first5=Ante|last6=Albrecht|first6=Renate|last7=Yonath|first7=Ada|last8=Franceschi|first8=François|journal=Nature|volume=413|issue=6858|pages=814–21|pmid=11677599|title=Structural basis for the interaction of antibiotics with the peptidyl transferase centre in eubacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating the structural basis of interactions between clinically relevant antibiotics and the 50S ribosome appeared in Nature in October 2001. High-resolution X-ray crystallography established that these antibiotics associate only with the 23S rRNA of a ribosomal subunit, and no interactions are formed with a subunit's protein portion. The article stresses that the results show "the importance of putative Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions for the binding of some drugs".

==Measuring magnesium in biological samples==

===By radioactive isotopes===
The use of radioactive tracer elements in ion uptake assays allows the calculation of km, Ki and Vmax and determines the initial change in the ion content of the cells. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Mg decays by the emission of a high-energy beta or gamma particle, which can be measured using a scintillation counter. However, the radioactive half-life of &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, the most stable of the radioactive magnesium isotopes, is only 21 hours. This severely restricts the experiments involving the nuclide. Also, since 1990, no facility has routinely produced &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, and the price per mCi is now predicted to be approximately US$30,000.&lt;ref name="Maguire 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Maguire| first= M.E.|author2=Cowan, J.

The difficulty of using metal ion replacement in the study of enzyme function is that the relationship between the enzyme activities with the replacement ion compared to the original is very difficult to ascertain.&lt;ref name="Tevelev 1995"/&gt;

===By fluorescent indicators===
A number of chelators of divalent cations have different fluorescence spectra in the bound and unbound states.&lt;ref name="Drakenberg 1995"&gt;{{cite book| last=Drakenberg| first= T. | year= 1995| title= Physical methods for studying the biological chemistry of magnesium| work= The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium| editor=J.

(2001) have described work into a new class of compounds that may prove more useful, having significantly better binding affinities for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Otten 2001"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Otten| first= P.A.|author2=London, R.E. |author3=Levy, L.

If the ion concentration is buffered by the cell by chelation or removal to subcellular compartments, the measured rate of uptake will give only minimum values of km and Vmax.

===By electrophysiology===
First, ion-specific microelectrodes can be used to measure the internal free ion concentration of cells and organelles. The major advantages are that readings can be made from cells over relatively long periods of time, and that unlike dyes very little extra ion buffering capacity is added to the cells.&lt;ref name="Gunzel 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gunzel| first= D.|author2=Schlue, W.-R. | year= 2002| title= Determination of [Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]i - an update on the use of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective electrodes| journal=BioMetals| volume= 15| pages= 237–249| doi=10.1023/A:1016074714951| pmid=12206390| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the technique of two-electrode voltage-clamp allows the direct measurement of the ion flux across the membrane of a cell.&lt;ref name="Hille 1992 ch2"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hille| first= B. | year=1992| title= Ionic channels of excitable membranes| location=Sunderland| publisher= Sinauer Associates Inc.| chapter=2| isbn=0-87893-322-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane is held at an electric potential and the responding current is measured. All ions passing across the membrane contribute to the measured current.

Third, the technique of patch-clamp uses isolated sections of natural or artificial membrane in much the same manner as voltage-clamp but without the secondary effects of a cellular system. Under ideal conditions the conductance of individual channels can be quantified. This methodology gives the most direct measurement of the action of ion channels.&lt;ref name="Hille 1992 ch2"/&gt;

===By absorption spectroscopy===
Flame [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS) determines the total magnesium content of a biological sample.&lt;ref name="Drakenberg 1995"/&gt; This method is destructive; biological samples must be broken down in concentrated acids to avoid clogging the fine nebulising apparatus. Beyond this, the only limitation is that samples must be in a volume of approximately 2 mL and at a concentration range of 0.1 – 0.4 µmol/L for optimum accuracy. As this technique cannot distinguish between Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; already present in the cell and that taken up during the experiment, only content not uptaken can be quantified.

[[Inductively coupled plasma]] (ICP) using either the [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) or [[atomic emission spectroscopy]] (AES) modifications also allows the determination of the total ion content of biological samples.&lt;ref name="Dean 1997"&gt;See Chapters 5 and 6 in  {{cite book| last=Dean| first= J.R. | year= 1997| title= Atomic Absorption and Plasma Spectroscopy| location=Chichester| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn=0-471-97255-X}} for descriptions of the methodology as applied to analytical chemistry.&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are more sensitive than flame AAS and are capable of measuring the quantities of multiple ions simultaneously. However, they are also significantly more expensive.

==Magnesium transport==
{{main|Magnesium transport}}

The chemical and biochemical properties of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; present the cellular system with a significant challenge when transporting the ion across biological membranes. The dogma of ion transport states that the transporter recognises the ion then progressively removes the water of hydration, removing most or all of the water at a selective pore before releasing the ion on the far side of the membrane.&lt;ref name="Hille 1992 ch11"&gt;Hille, 1992. Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the properties of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, large volume change from hydrated to bare ion, high energy of hydration and very low rate of ligand exchange in the inner [[coordination sphere]], these steps are probably more difficult than for most other ions. To date, only the ZntA protein of Paramecium has been shown to be a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel.&lt;ref name="Haynes 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Haynes| first= W. J.|author2=Kung, C. |author3=Saimi, Y. |author4=Preston, R. R. | year=2002| title= An exchanger-like protein underlies the large Mg2+ current in Paramecium| journal= PNAS| volume= 99| pages= 15717–15722| doi=10.1073/pnas.242603999| pmid=12422021| issue=24| pmc=137782}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport by the remaining proteins are beginning to be uncovered with the first three-dimensional structure of a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport complex being solved in 2004.&lt;ref name="Warren 2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Warren| first= M.

The [[hydration shell]] of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a very tightly bound inner shell of six water molecules and a relatively tightly bound second shell containing 12–14 water molecules (Markham ''et al.'', 2002). Thus, it is presumed that recognition of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion requires some mechanism to interact initially with the hydration shell of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by a direct recognition/binding of the ion to the protein.&lt;ref name="Maguire 2002"/&gt; Due to the strength of the inner sphere complexation between Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and any ligand, multiple simultaneous interactions with the transport protein at this level might significantly retard the ion in the transport pore. Hence, it is possible that much of the hydration water is retained during transport, allowing the weaker (but still specific) outer sphere coordination.

In spite of the mechanistic difficulty, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; must be transported across membranes, and a large number of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes across membranes from a variety of systems have been described.&lt;ref name="Gardner 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gardner| first= R. C. | year= 2003| title= Genes for magnesium transport| journal= Current Opinion in Plant Biology| volume= 6| pages= 263–267| doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(03)00032-3| pmid=12753976| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small selection of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters have been characterised at the molecular level.

=== Ligand ion channel blockade ===
[[Magnesium]] [[ion]]s (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[cellular biology]] are usually in almost all senses opposite to [[calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions, because they are [[Bivalent (chemistry)|bivalent]] too, but have greater [[electronegativity]] and thus exert greater pull on water molecules, preventing passage through the channel (even though the magnesium itself is smaller). Thus, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions block Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels such as ([[NMDA channel]]s) and have been shown to affect gap junction channels forming [[electrical synapse]]s.

==Plant physiology of magnesium==
The previous sections have dealt in detail with the chemical and biochemical aspects of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and its transport across cellular membranes. This section will apply this knowledge to aspects of whole plant physiology, in an attempt to show how these processes interact with the larger and more complex environment of the multicellular organism.

===Nutritional requirements and interactions===
Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is essential for plant growth and is present in higher plants in amounts on the order of 80 μmol g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; The amounts of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; vary in different parts of the plant and are dependent upon nutritional status. In times of plenty, excess Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be stored in vascular cells (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990;&lt;ref name="Shaul 1999"/&gt; and in times of starvation Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is redistributed, in many plants, from older to newer leaves.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Laing| first= W.|author2=Greer, D. |author3=Sun, O. |author4=Beets, P. |author5=Lowe, A. |author6=Payn, T.  | year=2000| title= Physiological impacts of Mg deficiency in Pinus radiata: growth and photosynthesis| journal= New Phytol| volume= 146| pages= 47–57| doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00616.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is taken up into plants via the roots. Interactions with other cations in the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]] can have a significant effect on the uptake of the ion.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980;&lt;ref name="Heenan 1981"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Heenan| first= D.P.|author2=Campbell, L.C. | year=1981| title= Influence of potassium and manganese on growth and uptake of magnesium by soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv Bragg| journal=Plant Soil| volume= 61| pages= 447–456| doi=10.1007/BF02182025| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of root cell walls is highly permeable to water and ions, and hence ion uptake into root cells can occur anywhere from the root hairs to cells located almost in the centre of the root (limited only by the [[Casparian strip]]). Plant cell walls and membranes carry a great number of negative charges, and the interactions of cations with these charges is key to the uptake of cations by root cells allowing a local concentrating effect.&lt;ref name="Hope 1952"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hope| first= A. B.|author2=Stevens, P. G. | year=1952| title= Electrical potential differences in bean roots on their relation to salt uptake| journal= Australian Journal of Scientific Research, Series B| volume= 5| pages= 335–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binds relatively weakly to these charges, and can be displaced by other cations, impeding uptake and causing deficiency in the plant.

Within individual plant cells, the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; requirements are largely the same as for all cellular life; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is used to stabilise membranes, is vital to the utilisation of ATP, is extensively involved in the nucleic acid biochemistry, and is a cofactor for many enzymes (including the ribosome). Also, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. It is the intracellular compartmentalisation of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in plant cells that leads to additional complexity. Four compartments within the plant cell have reported interactions with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Initially, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; will enter the cell into the cytoplasm (by an as yet unidentified system), but free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations in this compartment are tightly regulated at relatively low levels (≈2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L) and so any excess Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is either quickly exported or stored in the second intracellular compartment, the vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8.5.2 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mitochondria has been demonstrated in yeast&lt;ref name="Bui 1999"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bui| first= D.M.|author2=Gregan, J. |author3=Jarosch, E. |author4=Ragnini, A. |author5=Schweyen, R.

===Distributing magnesium ions within the plant===
Once in the cytoplasmic space of root cells Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, along with the other cations, is probably transported radially into the stele and the vascular tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.7 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; From the cells surrounding the xylem the ions are released or pumped into the xylem and carried up through the plant. In the case of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is highly mobile in both the xylem and phloem,&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; the ions will be transported to the top of the plant and back down again in a continuous cycle of replenishment. Hence, uptake and release from vascular cells is probably a key part of whole plant Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Figure 1 shows how few processes have been connected to their molecular mechanisms (only vacuolar uptake has been associated with a transport protein, AtMHX).

The diagram shows a schematic of a plant and the putative processes of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport at the root and leaf where Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is loaded and unloaded from the vascular tissues.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is taken up into the root cell wall space (1) and interacts with the negative charges associated with the cell walls and membranes. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be taken up into cells immediately (symplastic pathway) or may travel as far as the Casparian band (4) before being absorbed into cells (apoplastic pathway; 2). The concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the root cells is probably buffered by storage in root cell vacuoles (3). Note that cells in the root tip do not contain vacuoles. Once in the root cell cytoplasm, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; travels toward the centre of the root by [[plasmodesmata]], where it is loaded into the xylem (5) for transport to the upper parts of the plant. When the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reaches the leaves it is unloaded from the xylem into cells (6) and again is buffered in vacuoles (7). Whether cycling of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the phloem occurs via general cells in the leaf (8) or directly from xylem to phloem via [[transfer cells]] (9) is unknown. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may return to the roots in the phloem sap.

[[Image:whole plant mg transport.png|frame|center|Figure 1: Magnesium in the whole plant]]
When a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has been absorbed by a cell requiring it for metabolic processes, it is generally assumed that the ion stays in that cell for as long as the cell is active.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; In vascular cells, this is not always the case; in times of plenty, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is stored in the vacuole, takes no part in the day-to-day metabolic processes of the cell (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990), and is released at need. But for most cells it is death by senescence or injury that releases Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and many of the other ionic constituents, recycling them into healthy parts of the plant. In addition, when Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the environment is limiting, some species are able to mobilise Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from older tissues.&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"/&gt; These processes involve the release of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from its bound and stored states and its transport back into the vascular tissue, where it can be distributed to the rest of the plant. In times of growth and development, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is also remobilised within the plant as source and sink relationships change.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt;

The homeostasis of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within single plant cells is maintained by processes occurring at the plasma membrane and at the vacuole membrane (see Figure 2). The major driving force for the translocation of ions in plant cells is ΔpH.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.4 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proton ATPase|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases]] pump H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions against their concentration gradient to maintain the pH differential that can be used for the transport of other ions and molecules. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are pumped out of the cytoplasm into the extracellular space or into the vacuole. The entry of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into cells may occur through one of two pathways, via channels using the ΔΨ (negative inside) across this membrane or by [[Symporter|symport]] with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. To transport the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion into the vacuole requires a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Antiporter|antiport]] transporter (such as AtMHX). The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases are dependent on Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (bound to ATP) for activity, so that Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is required to maintain its own homeostasis.

A schematic of a plant cell is shown including the four major compartments currently recognised as interacting with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Proton ATPase|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases]] maintain a constant ΔpH across the plasma membrane and the vacuole membrane. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is transported into the vacuole using the energy of ΔpH (in ''A. thaliana'' by AtMHX). Transport of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into cells may use either the negative ΔΨ or the ΔpH. The transport of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into mitochondria probably uses ΔΨ as in the mitochondria of yeast, and it is likely that [[chloroplast]]s take Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by a similar system. The mechanism and the molecular basis for the release of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from vacuoles and from the cell is not known. Likewise, the light-regulated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration changes in chloroplasts are not fully understood, but do require the transport of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the [[thylakoid]] membrane.

===Magnesium, chloroplasts and photosynthesis===
Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the coordinating metal ion in the chlorophyll molecule, and in plants where the ion is in high supply about 6% of the total Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is bound to chlorophyll.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott 1990a"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Scott| first= B.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is probably taken up into chloroplasts to the greatest extent during the light-induced development from proplastid to chloroplast or etioplast to chloroplast. At these times, the synthesis of chlorophyll and the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane stacks absolutely require the divalent cation.&lt;ref name="Gregory 1989"&gt;{{cite book| last=Gregory| first= R.

Whether Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is able to move into and out of chloroplasts after this initial developmental phase has been the subject of several conflicting reports. Deshaies ''et al.'' (1984) found that Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; did move in and out of isolated chloroplasts from young pea plants,&lt;ref name="Deshaies 1984"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Deshaies| first= R.

The relative proportion of immature chloroplasts present in the preparations may explain these observations.

The metabolic state of the chloroplast changes considerably between night and day. During the day, the chloroplast is actively harvesting the energy of light and converting it into chemical energy. The activation of the metabolic pathways involved comes from the changes in the chemical nature of the stroma on the addition of light. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is pumped out of the stroma (into both the cytoplasm and the lumen) leading to an alkaline pH.&lt;ref name="Heldt 1973"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Heldt| first= H.W.|author2=Werdan, K. |author3=Milovancev, M. |author4=Geller, G. | year=1973| title= Alkalization of the chloroplast stroma caused by light-dependent proton flux into the thylakoid space| journal= Biochimica et Biophysica Acta| volume= 314| pages= 224–241| doi=10.1016/0005-2728(73)90137-0| pmid=4747067| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hind 1974"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hind| first= G.|author2=Nakatani, H.

Two major classes of the enzymes that interact with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the stroma during the light phase can be identified.&lt;ref name="Black 1995b"/&gt; Firstly, enzymes in the glycolytic pathway most often interact with two atoms of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The first atom is as an allosteric modulator of the enzymes’ activity, while the second forms part of the active site and is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. The second class of enzymes includes those where the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is complexed to nucleotide di- and tri-phosphates (ADP and ATP), and the chemical change involves phosphoryl transfer. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may also serve in a structural maintenance role in these enzymes (e.g., enolase).

===Magnesium stress===
{{Main|magnesium deficiency (agriculture)}}
Plant stress responses can be observed in plants that are under- or over-supplied with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The first observable signs of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stress in plants for both starvation and toxicity is a depression of the rate of photosynthesis, it is presumed because of the strong relationships between Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and chloroplasts/chlorophyll. In pine trees, even before the visible appearance of yellowing and necrotic spots, the photosynthetic efficiency of the needles drops markedly.&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"/&gt; In Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency, reported secondary effects include carbohydrate immobility, loss of RNA transcription and loss of protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8.5.6 of Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the mobility of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the plant, the deficiency phenotype may be present only in the older parts of the plant. For example, in Pinus radiata starved of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, one of the earliest identifying signs is the [[chlorosis]] in the needles on the lower branches of the tree. This is because Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has been recovered from these tissues and moved to growing (green) needles higher in the tree.&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"/&gt;

A Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficit can be caused by the lack of the ion in the media (soil), but more commonly comes from inhibition of its uptake.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binds quite weakly to the negatively charged groups in the root cell walls, so that excesses of other cations such as K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can all impede uptake.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980;&lt;ref name="Heenan 1981"/&gt; In acid soils Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is a particularly strong inhibitor of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake.&lt;ref name="Rengel 1989"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rengel| first= Z.|author2=Robinson, D. L. | year=1989| title= Competitive Al3+ Inhibition of Net Mg2+ Uptake by Intact Lolium multiflorum Roots : I.

Waisel |editor2=A. Eshel |editor3=U. Kafikfai| location=New York| publisher=Marcel Dekker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhibition by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is more severe than can be explained by simple displacement, hence it is possible that these ions bind to the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake system directly.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; In bacteria and yeast, such binding by Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has already been observed. Stress responses in the plant develop as cellular processes halt due to a lack of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g. maintenance of ΔpH across the plasma and vacuole membranes). In Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-starved plants under low light conditions, the percentage of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; bound to chlorophyll has been recorded at 50%.&lt;ref name="Dorenstouter 1985"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dorenstouter| first= H.|author2=Pieters, G.A. |author3=Findenegg, G. R. | year= 1985| title= Distribution of magnesium between chloroplhyll and other photosynthetic functions in magnesium deficient 'sun' and 'shade' leaves of poplar| journal= Journal of Plant Nutrition| volume= 8| pages= 1088–1101| doi=10.1080/01904168509363409| issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, this imbalance has detrimental effects on other cellular processes.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity stress is more difficult to develop. When Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is plentiful, in general the plants take up the ion and store it (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990). However, if this is followed by drought then ionic concentrations within the cell can increase dramatically. High cytoplasmic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations block a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel in the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast, in turn inhibiting the removal of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from the chloroplast stroma. This leads to an acidification of the stroma that inactivates key enzymes in [[carbon fixation]], which all leads to the production of oxygen [[free radicals]] in the chloroplast that then cause oxidative damage.&lt;ref name="Wu 1991"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wu| first= W.|author2=Peters, J. |author3=Berkowitz, G.A.  | year=1991| title= Surface Charge-Mediated Effects of Mg2+ on K+ Flux across the Chloroplast Envelope Are Associated with Regulation of Stromal pH and Photosynthesis| journal= Plant Physiology| volume= 97| pages= 580–587| doi=10.1104/pp.97.2.580| pmid=16668438| issue=2| pmc=1081046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This is often related to high food prices and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; A lack of [[breastfeeding]] may contribute, as may a number of [[infectious diseases]] such as: [[gastroenteritis]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and [[measles]], which increase nutrient requirements.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; There are two main types of undernutrition: [[protein-energy malnutrition]] and dietary deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Jones2011/&gt; Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: [[marasmus]] (a lack of protein and calories) and [[kwashiorkor]] (a lack of just protein).&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[iodine deficiency|iodine]], and [[vitamin A deficiency|vitamin A]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; During [[pregnancy]], due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Arora |editor-first1=Mala  |editor-last2=Konje |editor-first2=Justin C. |title=Recurrent pregnancy loss |date=2007 |publisher=Jaypee Bros.

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

==Causes==

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=John Ulimwengu|title=Need in a land of planty |publisher= dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/spite-drcs-huge-agricultural-potential-many-people-lack-vital-nutrients|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for investing in agriculture include [[Jeffrey Sachs]], who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa’s farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion |agency= |work= The New York Times|newspaper= |date=July 9, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Celia W. |last2=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children. The medical community recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months, with nutritional whole food supplementation and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years or older for overall optimal health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Linda C.|last2=Milligan|first2=Renee A.|last3=Frick|first3=Kevin D.|last4=Spatz|first4=Diane|last5=Bronner|first5=Yvonne|date=2002-06-01|title=Breastfeeding Duration, Costs, and Benefits of a Support Program for Low-Income Breastfeeding Women|journal=Birth|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00169.x|pmid=12000411|issn=1523-536X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaodong|last2=Wardlaw|first2=Tessa|last3=Brown|first3=David W.|date=2012-09-28|title=Global trends in exclusive breastfeeding|journal=International Breastfeeding Journal|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-7-12|pmid=23020813|pmc=3512504|issn=1746-4358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as only giving an infant breast milk for six months as a source of food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; This means no other liquids, including water or semi-solid foods.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sguassero|first1=Y|last2=de Onis|first2=M|last3=Bonotti|first3=AM|last4=Carroli|first4=G|date=Jun 13, 2012|title=Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD005039|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3|pmid=22696347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment.

Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Lazzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazzerini|first1=M|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|date=Jun 21, 2013|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009584|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|pmid=23794237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if [[ready-to-use therapeutic food]] differs from a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonees|first1=A|last2=Lombard|first2=M|last3=Musekiwa|first3=A|last4=Nel|first4=E|last5=Volmink|first5=J|date=Jun 6, 2013|title=Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of age.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2|pmid=23744450}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|date=June 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=BBC News|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those who are severely malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Via2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viana Lde|first1=A|last2=Burgos|first2=MG|last3=Silva Rde|first3=A|date=Jan–Mar 2012|title=Refeeding syndrome: clinical and nutritional relevance.|journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Cirurgia Digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian Archives of Digestive Surgery|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=22569981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with [[heart failure]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and confusion that can result in death.&lt;ref name="Via2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boateng|first1=AA|last2=Sriram|first2=K|last3=Meguid|first3=MM|last4=Crook|first4=M|date=Feb 2010|title=Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.|journal=Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)|volume=26|issue=2|pages=156–67|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.11.017|pmid=20122539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See especially Ch. 4 "Management of Acute Diarrhoea (Without Blood)" and Ch. 8 "Management of Diarrhoea With Severe Malnutrition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

In 2010 [[protein-energy malnutrition]] resulted in 600,000 deaths down from 883,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lozano R, Naghavi M, Foreman K, etal |title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 |journal=Lancet |volume=380 |issue=9859 |pages=2095–128 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23245604 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 |url=|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nutritional deficiencies, which include [[iodine deficiency]] and [[iron deficiency anemia]], result in another 84,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="Loz2012" /&gt; In 2010 malnutrition caused about 1.5 million deaths in women and children.&lt;ref name="Lim2012" /&gt;

Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously{{when|date=September 2016}} seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions. Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.1.23|jstor=3986477|title=The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education|author=Jere R.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity.

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health, accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global [[disease burden]] according to 2008 studies.&lt;ref name="Black2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = R.

The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide,&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; about 1 million children.&lt;ref name="ENJM013113"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manary|first1=Mark J. |author2=Indi Trehan |author3=Hayley S.

(2008). [http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/saferwater/en/ Safer water, better health - Costs, benefits and sustainability of interventions to protect and promote health]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Women===

{{main article|Food security#Gender and food security}}
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

The '''Maria reactor''' is [[Poland]]'s second [[nuclear research reactor]] and the only one still in use. It is located at Świerk-[[Otwock]], near Warsaw and named in honor of [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]]. It is the only reactor of Polish design.

Maria is a multifunctional research tool, with a notable application in production of [[radioisotope]]s, research with utilization of neutron beams, [[neutron therapy]], and [[neutron activation analysis]]. It operates about 4000 hours annually, usually in blocks of 100 hours.

==Technical description==
The technical details of the reactor are given in the references.&lt;ref&gt;"Reaktor Maria" at the website of the Polish Institute of Atomic Energy  (pl:Instytut Energii Atomowej) "POLATOM" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110228013041/http://www.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor_ang.html (English)] [http://www.iea.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor.html (Polish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221134737/http://www.iea.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor.html |date=2009-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krzysztoszek-2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/meetings/PDFplus/2007/cn156/cn156presentations/cn156_Krzysztoszek.pdf |title=Maria research reactor conversion to LEU fuel |first=Grzegorz |last=Krzysztoszek |publisher=IAEA |work=Institute of Atomic Energy |year=2007 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cyf.gov.pl/nowa/annual_report_pdf/2008/Chapter_1.pdf |title=Operation of Maria Research Reactor |author1=G.

Maria is a [[pool reactor|pool type reactor]] with a power of 20 to 30 MW (thermal). Despite it being a pool reactor, it contains channels (aluminum tubes) individually connected to the primary coolant. The water pool provides cooling for elements (e.g., fuel elements) that are not otherwise cooled, and also acts as radiation shielding. Maria uses [[enriched uranium]] as fuel (80% enrichment in [[U-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] till year 1999; 36% since). The fuel elements and channels are vertical but arranged conically. Water and [[beryllium]] blocks serve as the moderator (70% and 30% of the moderation, respectively). Elements of [[boron carbide]] sheathed in aluminum are utilized for control, compensation, and safety. The use of beryllium blocks results in a comparatively large fuel lattice pitch, and consequently large volume for payload targets. There is also a [[graphite]] [[neutron reflector|reflector]] (aluminum sheathed). Maria supplies a [[neutron flux]] of 4x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s ([[thermal neutrons]]) and 2x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s ([[fast neutrons]]). There are six horizontal channels for controlled use of neutron beams. There is also a window of lead-containing glass through which the core can be viewed. The reactor is housed in a [[Containment building|sealed containment]].

Following preparation which started in 2004, Maria was converted to use [[Uranium enrichment#Low-enriched uranium (LEU)|low-enriched uranium]] (LEU) fuel by 2012.&lt;ref name=krzysztoszek-2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/mariareactor092512 |title=NNSA Helps Poland Convert Reactor, Remove Highly Enriched Uranium |publisher=NNSA |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction began on June 16, 1970 and the reactor was activated on December 18, 1974. With the shutdown of the [[Ewa reactor]] in 1995 it became Poland's only research nuclear reactor.

In February 2010, it was announced that Maria will start producing [[medical isotopes]] in cooperation with [[Covidien]], to help ease the isotope shortages due to shutdowns of the Canadian [[National Research Universal Reactor|NRU reactor]] and the Dutch [[Petten nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Wawrzyński, "Reaktor Maria ratuje świat", "Gazeta Wyborcza", 2010-02-17 [http://wyborcza.pl/1,75476,7572615,Reaktor_Maria_ratuje_swiat.html (in Polish)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Wald, "Poland emerges as new source of rare medical isotope", [[International Herald Tribune]], 2010-02-18, p.2 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/health/17isotope.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">'''Marouflage''' is a technique for affixing a [[painting|painted]] canvas to a wall to be used as a [[mural]], using an adhesive that hardens as it dries such as [[plaster]] or [[cement]].

==History==
[[File:Cocarde IMG 2197.jpg|thumb|Interior sign of a Parisian pub, oil on canvas, marouflage on cardboard, ([[Musée de la Révolution française]])]]

A [[French language|French]] word originally referring to sticky, partly hardened scraps of paint, marouflage is a 3,000-year-old technique. Historically, artists used several types of adhesives including a [[rabbit-skin glue]]. [[White lead ore]] was used in the 19th and 20th centuries in the mixture to help it dry.

A thin coat of the [[adhesive]] is applied to both the wall and the [[canvas]]. Once the canvas is mounted to the wall, pressure is exerted with rubber hand rollers to smooth the canvas and remove any bubbles.

==Uses==
===Conservation===
In [[art conservation]], the word can be [[term of art]] meaning the removal of the painted surface from its underlying support, usually a stretched canvas. The process is more typically called transferring and can cause significant damage. Twenty-first century conservators seldom need to resort to this technique.

==Murals==
Intended murals are normally painted on large canvas in the studio and attached to the wall on site, using a starch based glue (applied to the wall only), the murals can then be moved (by a professional) and re-instated elsewhere if required.  The damage caused to the painting if removed using this technique is minimal.

The '''Masters and Johnson Institute''' (1964–1994) was the clinical and research foundation of [[sexologist]] duo [[Masters and Johnson]]. Located in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]], the institute was established to study [[human sexuality]] with particular emphasis on the [[sexual anatomy|anatomy and physiology]] of [[human sexual response cycle|human sexual response]] and the diagnosis and treatment of [[sexual disorders|sexual dysfunctions]].

Founded as the '''Reproductive Biology Research Foundation''', the organization changed its name to the Masters and Johnson Institute in 1978; it closed in 1994.

==History==
After [[William H. Masters]] hired [[Virginia E. Johnson]] in 1957 as a research assistant on a project in human sexuality, they originally worked together in the Department of [[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], before continuing to create an independent research institution at 4910 Forest Park Avenue in the Central Medical Building in St. Louis in 1964, deliberately named the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation (rather than using the word "sex" in its title) to keep their work out of the limelight. The foundation did, in fact, conduct studies of conception, contraception, and infertility, although the major focus of its work was on advancing the scientific study of human sexuality.

Their work, which pioneered human sexuality as a science, was primarily conducted at this institute.  They published books including ''{{no redirect|Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response}}'' (1966; {{OCLC|318151909}}) and ''{{no redirect|Human Sexual Inadequacy}}'' (1970; {{OCLC|299881470}}).

Masters and Johnson married in 1971 and by 1978, at the urging of their board of directors, agreed to rename their foundation Masters &amp; Johnson Institute believing that the institutes's work might capitalize to a degree on their personal fame.

At the height of its operations, the institute included a multi-disciplinary staff of medical professionals (including specialists from the fields of obstetrics and gynecology, [[internal medicine]] and [[endocrinology]], [[psychiatry]], and [[nursing]]) as well as [[behavior therapy|behavioral clinician]]s (including [[clinical psychologist]]s, [[social worker]]s, [[theologian]]s, and pastoral counselors) and a dedicated [[biochemical]] and endocrine laboratory.

The institute conducted a wide range of workshop and seminar programs for health care professionals both in St. Louis and across the country and also ran a full-time training program for [[sex therapist]]s.  In addition to the research and educational work it conducted, and its world-renowned therapy program, the institute also spearheaded a drive during the 1970s to establish ethical guidelines for sex educators, therapists, and researchers.

The institute was closed when Masters retired in 1994.

==Popular culture==
The founders and their institute inspired the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV series ''[[Masters of Sex]]''.

'''Mediated quasi-interaction''' is a concept in [[communication science]] that describes a monological interaction between people, which is oriented towards an indefinite range of potential recipients.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson,1995&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a fundamental asymmetry between producers and receivers.&lt;ref name="DavidHesmondhalgh"&gt;David Hesmondhalgh,2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Mediated Quasi-Interaction are television, radio and newspapers and other forms of mass media.

== History ==

The concept was developed by sociologist [[John Brookshire Thompson]], a professor at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]. The concept is first documented in his book “The Rise of Mediated Interaction”, which was published in 1995 in Cambridge, UK. Thompson developed a [[conceptual framework]] for the analysis of the forms of action and interaction created by the media. He wanted to focus the types of interactional situation created by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He also wanted the analytical framework to examine some of the interactional features of the social relationships established by the media.&lt;ref name="Thompson_a"&gt;Thompson 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He created the concept in part of his theory of interaction. The 3 steps theory consisted of Face-to-Face interaction, Mediated Interaction and Mediated Quasi-Interaction. Face-to- people share time and space, since they are co-present and mediated interaction the sending of the message and its reception are separated in time and space.&lt;ref name="Wouters"&gt;Wouters,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic premises and approach ==

Mediated Quasi-interaction is monologicial in character and involves the production of symbolic forms for an indefinite range of potential recipients. Mediated Quasi-Interaction creates a certain kind of social situation in which individuals are linked together in a process of communication and symbolic exchange. It is a structured situation in which some individuals are engaged primarily in producing symbolic forms for others who are not physically present, while others are involved primarily in receiving symbolic forms produced to whom they cannot respond, but with whom they can form bonds of friendship, affection or loyalty.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated quasi-interaction is based on social relations established by media of mass communications.&lt;ref name="TerhiRantanen"&gt;Terhi Rantanen,2005&lt;/ref&gt; With mass media being impossible to be genuine interactivity, Mediated quasi-interaction is simulated interaction. It is typical for the mass media to try to simulate [[interpersonal communication]] and to personalize their communication (ex. Call-ins).&lt;ref name="PekkaIsotalus"&gt;Pekka Isotalus,1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another focus of Mediated Quasi-Interaction is also on its space-time constitution. It is described as a separation of contexts with extended availability in time and space.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated Quasi-Interaction can also be combined with other interaction such as [[dyadic communication|face-to-face]]. For example, people can sit in a room together and have a discussion while they are watching television. In a similar relation, a television program may involve face to face interaction with a panel and an audience, although the program remains primarily a form Mediated Quasi-Interaction.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

[[File:Tomb of the Unknown Warrior June 2012.JPG|300px|thumb|The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in June 2012]]
The '''New Zealand Tomb of the Unknown Warrior''' is at the [[National War Memorial (New Zealand)|National War Memorial]] in Buckle Street, [[Wellington]]. 

On 6 November 2004, the remains of an unknown New Zealand soldier were exhumed from the ([[CWGC]]) [[Caterpillar Valley Cemetery]], and laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Wellington, New Zealand. He represents over 18,000 members of New Zealand forces who lost their lives during the First World War. A special headstone marks his original resting place in Plot 14, Row A, Grave 27.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Handover16.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Catafalque]] Guard stands in position flanking the casket of the New Zealand Unknown Warrior during the handover ceremony|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 17 November 2007}}]] --&gt;On 6 November 2004 the remains, in a copper [[coffin]] sealed and placed in a [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]] coffin brought from New Zealand, were handed over from the care of the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] to a New Zealand delegation during a ceremony at [[Longueval]], [[Somme (department)|Somme]], [[France]]. [[New Zealand Defence Force]] chief, [[Air Marshal]] [[Bruce Ferguson]], who had the task of repatriating the Warrior's remains, said of the occasion "I told him [the Warrior] we're taking him home and that those who are taking him home are soldiers, sailors and airmen, past and present. I asked the Warrior to be the guardian of all military personnel who had died on active service. I then promised that we, the people of New Zealand, will be his guardian for ever".

The Warrior arrived in New Zealand on 10 November 2004. While he lay in state in the Parliament Buildings an estimated 10,000 people paid their respects. The Warrior was laid to rest on the 86th [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 2004, after a service at [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, Wellington|St Paul's Anglican Cathedral]] and a 2.85 km [[Parade (military)|slow march]] procession through the streets of Wellington, lined by about 100,000 people. The Tomb was sealed with a [[bronze]] [[mantel]] at 3:59pm, bearing the words:&lt;br&gt;
{{cquote|An Unknown New Zealand Warrior&lt;br&gt;
He Toa Matangaro No Aotearoa}}

The Warrior is one of more than 1500 New Zealanders killed on the Somme. Most of them, 1272, remained unidentified and are buried in unmarked graves or remembered on memorial walls. The remains are thought to include an almost complete skeleton, and other belongings that established beyond doubt the Warrior's nationality.

==Awards==
The Warrior was awarded:
* [[1914–15 Star]] for service between August 1914 and December 1915
* [[British War Medal]] for service during World War I up to 1920
* [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]]
* [[1939–1945 Star]] for service during [[World War II]]
* [[New Zealand Operational Service Medal]]

The [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]] also awarded its Badge in Gold, the first time it has been awarded posthumously. Immediate Past National President David Cox, a World War II veteran, made the presentation:

{{cquote|The Badge in Gold is a fitting tribute because the Unknown Warrior paid the ultimate price for his service and now he is finally returned. You are now one of us — welcome home.}}

Each RNZRSA District President placed soil and other items into the Tomb to acknowledge the service personnel from their districts who had given their lives to the nation, including soil from the farm of [[Charles Upham]]. Soil from Caterpillar Valley Cemetery was provided by the [[Ambassador]] from France, Jean-Michel Marlaud.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5696">[[Culture]] consists of both [[material culture]] and '''non-material culture'''. Thoughts or ideas that make up a culture are called the non-material culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to material culture, non-material culture does not include any physical objects or artifacts. Examples of non-material culture include any [[idea]]s, [[belief]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[Norm (social)|norms]] that may help shape [[society]].

== Language ==



Language and culture are closely tied together and can affect one another. One example of culture shaping language is the case of the [[Pirahã people]]. Their lack of words for numbers makes it impossible for them to have complex mathematical systems in their culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language: The Cultural Tool|last=Everett|first=Daniel L.|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=2012|isbn=9780307473806|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a result of their cultural requirements: because they have no need for extensive mathematics, there would be no need for them to form number words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The formation of [[American slang (disambiguation)|American slang]] can also serve as a reflection of culture and has changed as American culture developed. For example, as people began speaking out in defense of homosexuality in the 1960s, vulgar language and slang became more acceptable to use and began to be included in dictionaries.

The theory based on the works of [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] holds that language actually limits and shapes how people see the world around them. This theory of [[linguistic relativity]] would indicate that language alters and restricts the formation of language.

== Symbols ==
In his 1973 book, ''[[The Interpretation of Cultures]]'', anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] refers to culture as "a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Basic Books, Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=89|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing the importance he placed on symbols in culture. Just like language, symbols form as a culture grows. People in a particular society attribute meaning to specific objects, and that imbued meaning transforms that object into a widely recognized symbol in that society. There can be symbols that cross cultural boundaries. For example, a cross is a universal symbol of [[Christianity]], and is so universally known due to the prevalence of Christianity in different cultures.

== Behavior ==
The culture that an individual is part of influences several aspects of that individual, including behavior. Through [[socialization]], an individual will learn the values and norms inherent in their society and, in most cases, will behave according to those values and norms. Behavior is important because it can convey the values of a society. For example, in Japanese culture, which depends on the "fundamental relatedness of individuals"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markus|first=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224|journal=Psychological Review|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is important to fit in with those around you and maintain harmonious personal relationships. Individuals in Japanese culture behave to avoid exclusion from society, putting flexibility, empathy, and self-restraint above expression of personal thoughts and opinions. 

Behavior can also influence a culture. This can be seen in the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in [[India]]. In higher caste levels, it is customary for an individual to follow [[Sanskrit|Sanskritic]] customs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and society among the Coorgs of South India|last=Srinivas|first=Mysore Narasimhachar|publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press|year=1952|isbn=|location=|pages=30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in the lower caste levels take on this behavior in order to move up in the caste system. This type of behavior has had an influence on Indian culture: the numerous lower caste individuals participating in Sanskritic customs helped spread those customs all throughout India.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Occupational health psychology''' ('''OHP''') is an interdisciplinary area of psychology that is concerned with the health and safety of workers.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"&gt;Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Chang, C.-H. (2017). ''Occupational health psychology: Work, stress, and health''. New York, NY: Springer Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houdmont"&gt;Houdmont, J., &amp; Leka, S. (2010).

John Wiley: Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''Occupational Health Psychology (OHP)''. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohp/]&lt;/ref&gt; OHP addresses a number of major topic areas including the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, the impact of [[involuntary unemployment]] on physical and mental health, work-family balance, workplace violence and other forms of mistreatment, accidents and safety, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Houdmont"/&gt; OHP emerged from two distinct disciplines within [[applied psychology]], namely, [[health psychology]] and [[industrial and organizational psychology]], as well as [[occupational medicine]].&lt;ref name="Everly 1986"&gt;Everly, G.S., Jr. (1986).

== Historical overview ==

===Origins===
The [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted thinkers, such as [[Karl Marx]] with his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. (1967/1845). The German ideology. In L.D. Easton &amp; K.H.L. Guddat (Eds. and Trans.), ''Writings of the young Marx on philosophy and society''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; to concern themselves with the nature of work and its impact on workers.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor's]] (1911) ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management|Principles of Scientific Management]]''&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, F.W.

Washington, DC: Gower Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Elton Mayo|Mayo’s]] research in the late 1920s and early 1930s on workers at the [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne Western Electric plant]]&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1933) ''The human problems of an industrial civilization''. New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to inject the impact of work on workers into the subject matter psychology addresses. About the time Taylorism arose, [[James Hartness|Hartness]] reconsidered worker-machine interaction and its impact on worker psychology.&lt;ref name=Hartness1912&gt;{{Citation |last=Hartness |first=James |title=The human factor in works management |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1912 |location=New York and London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB41AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=1065709 |postscript=. Republished by Hive Publishing Company as Hive management history series no. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-87960-047-1}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation in 1948 of the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research|Institute for Social Research]] (ISR) at the [[History of the University of Michigan#Later 20th century .E2.80.94 Increasing student activism|University of Michigan]] was important because of its research on [[occupational stress]] and employee health.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, R.P. et al. (1971). ''Survey of working conditions: Final report on univariate and bivariate tables, Document No. 2916-0001''. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House, J.S.

Alienation and mental health in the modern industrial environment. In L. Levi (Ed.), ''Society, stress and disease'' (Vol. 1, pp. 148–180). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the impact of unemployment on mental health was conducted at the University of Sheffield’s Institute of Work Psychology.&lt;ref name = "Christie"/&gt; In 1970 Kasl and Cobb documented the impact of unemployment on blood pressure in U.S. factory workers.&lt;ref name="Kasl and Cobb"&gt;Kasl, S.V., &amp; Cobb, S. (1970). Blood pressure changes in men undergoing job loss: A preliminary report. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 32''(1), 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition as a field of study===
A number of individuals are associated with the creation of the term “occupational health psychology” or "occupational health psychologist."&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2018). Occupational health psychology. In D.S. Dunn (Ed.), ''Oxford Bibliographies in Psychology''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They include Ferguson (1977),&lt;ref name = "Ferguson 1977"&gt;Ferguson, D. (1977). The psychologist and occupational health. ''Proceedings of the Annual Conference, Ergonomics Society of Australia and New Zealand'' (pp. 41–50). Adelaide, South Australia, Australia: Department of Psychology, University of Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman (1985),&lt;ref name = "Feldman 1985"&gt;Feldman, R.H.L. (1985). Promoting occupational safety and health. G. Everly &amp; R.H.L. Feldman (Eds.), ''Occupational health promotion: Health behavior in the workplace'' (pp. 188–207). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Everly (1986),&lt;ref name="Everly 1986"/&gt; and Raymond, Wood, and Patrick (1990).&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"&gt;Raymond, J.S., Wood, D., &amp; Patrick, W.K. (1990). Psychology doctoral training in work and health. ''American Psychologist, 45'', 1159–1161. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.45.10.1159&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in response to a dramatic increase in the number of stress-related worker compensation claims in the U.S., the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) "recognized stress-related psychological disorders as a leading occupational health risk" (p.&amp;nbsp;201).&lt;ref name="sauter1999"&gt;Sauter, S.L., Hurrell, J.J., Jr., Fox, H.R., Tetrick, L.E., &amp; Barling, J. (1999). Occupational health psychology: An emerging discipline. ''Industrial Health, 37''(2), 199–211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apatimeline"&gt;"Milestones in the history of occupational health psychology", (February 2002). ''Monitor on Psychology'', [[American Psychological Association]]. 33(2). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/milestones.aspx] Retrieved July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When this change was coupled with an increased recognition of the impact of stress on a range of problems in the workplace, NIOSH found that their stress-related programs were significantly increasing in  prominence.&lt;ref name="sauter1999" /&gt; In 1990, Raymond et al.&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"/&gt; argued that the time has come for doctoral-level psychologists to get interdisciplinary OHP training, integrating [[health psychology]] with [[public health]], because creating healthy workplaces should be a goal for the field.

===Emergence as a discipline===
Established in 1987, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' is the first and "longest established journal in the fast developing discipline that is occupational health psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"&gt;Cox, T., &amp; Tisserand, M. (2006). Editorial: Work &amp; Stress comes of age: Twenty years of occupational health psychology. ''Work &amp; Stress, 20'', 1–5. doi:10.1080/02678370600739795&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"&gt;Barling, J., &amp; Griffiths, A. (2011). A history of occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 21–34). Washington, D.C., American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' was published by APA. That same year, the [[International Commission on Occupational Health]] created the Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee,&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Occupational Health-Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors [http://www.icohweb.org/site/scientific-committee-detail.asp?sc=33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/ico_scientific_committees.asp International Commission on Occupational Health]&lt;/ref&gt; which focused primarily on OHP.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; In 1999, the [[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"&gt;Houdmont, J. (2009). Across the pond: A history of the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology. ''Newsletter of the Society of Occupational Health Psychology, 7'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That workshop is considered to be the first EA-OHP conference, the first of a continuing series of conferences EA-OHP organizes and devotes to OHP research and practice.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"/&gt;

In 2000 the informal International Coordinating Group for Occupational Health Psychology (ICGOHP) was founded for the purpose of facilitating OHP-related research, education, and practice as well as coordinating international conference scheduling.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; Also in 2000, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' became associated with the EA-OHP.&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"/&gt; In 2005, the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]] (SOHP) was established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schonfeld, I.S. (2007). The historical development of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology (SOHP). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 2. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, SOHP joined with APA and NIOSH in co-sponsoring the Work, Stress, and Health conferences.&lt;ref name = "Hammer"&gt;Hammer, L.B., Sauter, S., &amp; Limanowski, J. (2008) Work, stress, and health 2008. ''Society for Occupational Health Psychology Newsletter, 2'', 2. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV2January2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, EA-OHP and SOHP began to coordinate biennial conferences schedules such that the organizations' conferences would take place on alternate years, minimizing scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name = "Hammer"/&gt; In 2017, SOHP and Springer began to publish an OHP-related journal ''Occupational Health Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/psychology/arbeits-+organisations-+%26+wirtschaftspsychologie/journal/41542 ''Occupational Health Science.'' Accessed January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Important theoretical models in OHP research===

Three influential theoretical models in OHP research are the demand-control-support, demand-resources, and effort-reward imbalance models.

==== Demand-control-support model ====
The most influential model in OHP research has been the original demand-control model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; According to the model, the combination of low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e., [[job control (workplace)|autonomy and control over the job]]) combined with high workloads (high levels of work demands) can be particularly harmful to workers (they can lead to "job strain," a term representing the combination of low decision latitude and high workload leading to poorer mental or physical health).&lt;ref name = "karasek 1979"&gt;Karasek, R.A. (1979). Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 24''(2), 285–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests not only that these two job factors are related to poorer health but that high levels of decision latitude on the job will buffer or reduce the adverse health impact of high levels of demands. Research has clearly supported the idea that decision latitude and demands relate to strains, but research findings about buffering have been mixed with only some studies providing support.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange, A.H., Taris, T.W., Kompier, M.A., Houtman, I.L., &amp; Bongers, P.M. (2003). "The very best of the millennium": Longitudinal research and the demand-control-(support) model. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 8'', 282–305. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.8.4.282&lt;/ref&gt; The demand-control model asserts that job control can come in two broad forms: ‘skill discretion’ and ‘decision authority’.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"&gt;Bean, C.G., Winefield, H.R., Sargent, C., &amp; Hutchinson, A.D.

''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 143'', 1–8. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.034&lt;/ref&gt; Skill discretion refers to the level of skill and creativity required on the job and the flexibility an employee is permitted in deciding what skills to use (e.g. opportunity to use skills, similar to job variety).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"&gt;de Araújo, T.M., Karasek. R. (2008) Validity and reliability of the job content questionnaire in formal and informal jobs in Brazil. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 6'', Suppl. 52–59&lt;/ref&gt; Decision authority refers to employees being able to make decisions about their work (e.g., having autonomy).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"/&gt; These two forms of job control are traditionally assessed together in a composite measure of decision latitude; there is, however, some evidence that the two types of job control may not be similarly related to health outcomes.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joensuu, M. et al. et al. (2012). Differential associations of job control components with mortality: A cohort study, 1986–2005. ''American Journal of Epidemiology, 175'', 609–619. doi:10.1093/aje/kws028&lt;/ref&gt;

About a decade after Karasek first introduced the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989),&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1989"&gt;Johnson, J. V., Hall, E. M., &amp; Theorell, T. (1989). Combined effects of job strain and social isolation on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in a random sample of the Swedish male working population. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 15'', 271–279. doi:10.5271/sjweh.1852&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support “iso-strain.” The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand–control–support (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that one or more of the components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack of social support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Job demands-resources model ====

An alternative model, the [[job demands-resources model|job demands-resources (JD-R) model]],&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F., &amp; Schaufeli, W.B. (2001). The job demands-resources model of burnout. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 86'', 499–512. doi:10.1037//0021-9010.86.3.499&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains more or less the same as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Effort-reward imbalance model====
After the DCS model, the, perhaps, second most influential model in OHP research has been the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model. It links job demands to the rewards employees receive for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J., &amp; Peter, R. (1994). Job stressors and coping characteristics in work-related disease: Issues of validity. ''Work &amp; Stress, 8'', 130–140. doi: 10.1080/02678379408259985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J. (1996). Adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 27–41. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.1.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; That model holds that high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related intrinsic (e.g., recognition) and extrinsic (e.g., pay) rewards triggers high levels of activation in neurohormonal pathways that, cumulatively, are thought to exert adverse effects on mental and physical health.

=== Occupational stress and physical health ===
A number of work-related, psychosocial factors have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

====Cardiovascular disease====
{{Main|Occupational stress|Cardiovascular disease}}
Research has identified health-behavioral and biological factors that are related to increased risk for CVD. These risk factors include smoking, obesity, low density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol), lack of exercise, and blood pressure. Psychosocial working conditions are also risk factors for CVD.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; In a case-control study involving two large U.S. data sets, Murphy (1991) found that hazardous work situations, jobs that required vigilance and responsibility for others, and work that required  attention to devices were related to increased risk for cardiovascular disability.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, L.R. (1991). Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 44''(2), 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt; These included jobs in transportation (e.g., air traffic controllers, airline pilots, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), preschool teachers, and craftsmen.

''American Journal of Public Health, 78''(10), 1336–1342.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 17 [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] having reasonably high [[internal validity]] found that 8 showed a significant relation between the combination of low levels of decision latitude and high workload (the job strain condition) and CVD and 3 more showed a nonsignificant relation.&lt;ref&gt;Belkic, K.L., Landsbergis, P.A., Schnall, P.L., &amp; Baker, D.

''The Lancet, 380'', 1491–1497. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60994-5&lt;/ref&gt; found that, controlling for other risk factors, the combination of high levels of demands and low control at baseline increased the risk of CVD in initially healthy workers by between 20 and 30% over a follow-up period that averaged 7.5 years. In this study the effects were similar for men and women.

====Workplace incivility====
{{Main|Incivility}}
[[Workplace incivility]] has been defined as "low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target....Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others" (p.&amp;nbsp;457).&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, L.

''Academy of Management Review, 24'', 452–471. doi:10.5465/AMR.1999.2202131&lt;/ref&gt;  Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, social isolation, etc. A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there.&lt;ref name="cortina magley"&gt;Cortina, L.M., Magley, V., Williams, J.H., &amp; Langhout, R.D.

==== Workplace violence ====
{{Main|Workplace violence}}
Workplace violence is a significant health hazard for employees, both physically and psychologically.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

::-Nonfatal assault-
Most workplace assaults are nonfatal, with an annual physical assault rate of 6% in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., Frone, M.R., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Prevalence of workplace aggression in the U.S. workforce. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J.  Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 47–89). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Assaultive behavior in the workplace often produces injury, psychological distress, and economic loss. One study of California workers found a rate of 72.9 non-fatal, officially documented [[assault]]s per 100,000 workers per year, with workers in the education, retail, and health care sectors subject to excess risk.&lt;ref&gt;Peek Asa, C., Howard, J., Vargas, L., Kraus, J.F. (1997). Incidence of non-fatal workplace assault injuries determined from employer's reports in California. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 39''(1), 44–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Minnesota workers' compensation study found that women workers had a twofold higher risk of being injured in an assault than men, and health and social service workers, transit workers, and members of the education sector were at high risk for injury compared to workers in other economic sectors.&lt;ref name="LaMar, 1998"/&gt; A West Virginia workers' compensation study found that workers in the [[health care]] sector and, to a lesser extent, the education sector were at elevated risk for assault-related injury.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, S.S., Edla, S.R., Mujuru, P., Doyle, E.J., &amp; Ducatman, A.M.

=== Mental disorder ===
{{Main|Mental disorder}}
Research has found that psychosocial workplace factors are among the risk factors for a number of categories of mental disorder.

==== Alcohol abuse ====
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Workplace factors can contribute to alcohol abuse and dependence of employees. Rates of abuse can vary by occupation, with high rates in the construction and transportation industries as well as among waiters and waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell W., Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., &amp; Garrison, R. (1992). Alcoholism and occupations: A review and analysis of 104 occupations.  ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 16'', 734–746. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1992.tb00670.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the transportation sector, heavy truck drivers and material movers were shown to be at especially high risk.  A prospective study of ECA subjects who were followed one year after the initial interviews provided data on newly [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incident]] cases of alcohol abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, R.M., Muntaner. C., Eaton. W.W., &amp; Anthony. J.C. (1995). Occupational stress and the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 19'', 647–655. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb01562.x&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that workers in jobs that combined low control with high physical demands were at increased risk of developing alcohol problems although the findings were confined to men.

==== Depression ====
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Using data from the ECA study, Eaton, Anthony, Mandel, and Garrison (1990) found that members of three occupational groups, lawyers, secretaries, and special education teachers (but not other types of teachers) showed elevated rates of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-III'']] major depression, adjusting for social demographic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., Mandel, W., &amp; Garrison, R. (1990). Occupations and the prevalence of major depressive disorder. ''Journal of Occupational Medicine, 32''(11), 1079–1087.&lt;/ref&gt; The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates of the risk of mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]], no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted.   Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wang J. (2005). Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s). ''Psychological Medicine, 35'', 865–871. doi:10.1017/S0033291704003241&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review and [[meta-analysis]] links high demands, low control, and low support to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, I.H., Nyberg, S.T.,  Magnusson Hanson, L.L., et al. (2017). Job strain as a risk factor for clinical depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis with additional individual participant data. ''Psychological Medicine, 47'', 1342–135. doi:10.1017/S003329171600355X&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name="Stansfeld 2006"/&gt;

==== Personality disorders ====
{{Main|Personality disorder}}
Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace, potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as [[substance abuse]] and co-morbid mental disorders, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L. (2011). Personality disorders and Work. In Schultz &amp; Rogers (Eds.), ''Work accommodation and retention in mental health'' (pp. 163–188). New York: Springer. doi:10.1007978-1-4419-0428-9_9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L., Maclean, J.C., &amp; French, M.T. (2011). Does having a dysfunctional personality hurt your career? Axis II personality disorders and labor market outcomes. ''Industrial Relations, 50'', 149–173. doi:10.1111/j.1468-232X.2010.00629.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schizophrenia ====
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
In a case-control study, Link, Dohrenwend, and Skodol found that, compared to depressed and well control subjects, schizophrenic patients were more likely to have had jobs, prior to their first episode of the disorder, that exposed them to “noisesome” work characteristics (e.g., noise, humidity, heat, cold, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Link, B.G., Dohrenwend, B.P., &amp; Skodol, A.E. (1986). Socio-economic status and schizophrenia: Noisome occupational characteristics as a risk factor. ''American Sociological Review, 51'', 242–258. doi:10.2307/2095519&lt;/ref&gt; The jobs tended to be of higher status than other blue collar jobs, suggesting that downward drift in already-affected individuals does not account for the finding. One explanation involving a [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that the job-related stressors helped precipitate the first episode in already-vulnerable individuals. There is some supporting evidence from the [[Psychiatric epidemiology#Example: The Epidemiological Catchment Area Project|Epidemiologic Catchment Area]] (ECA) study.&lt;ref&gt;Muntaner, C., Tien, A.Y., Eaton, W.W., &amp; Garrison R. (1991). Occupational characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic disorders. ''Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 26'', 273–280. doi:10.1007/BF00789219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological distress ===
{{Main|Psychological distress}}
[[longitudinal study|Longitudinal studies]] have suggested adverse working conditions can contribute to the development of psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, M.T., Matthews, R.A., Wooldridge, J.D., Mishra, V., Kakar, U.M., &amp; Strahan, S.R. (2014). How do occupational stressor-strain effects vary with time? A review and meta-analysis of the relevance of time lags in longitudinal studies. Work &amp; Stress, 28, 9–30. doi: 10.1080/02678373.2013.877096&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress refers to [[negative affect]], without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Dohrenwend, B.P., Shrout, P.E., Egri, G., &amp; Mendelsohn, F.S. (1980). Nonspecific psychological distress and other dimensions of psychopathology: Measures for use in the general population. ''Archives of General Psychiatry, 37'', 1229–1236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J.D. (1973). ''Persuasion and healing''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and [[anxiety]] symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. [[Job satisfaction]] is also related to negative health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, E.S., &amp; Grunberg, L. (1995). Work alienation and problem alcohol behavior. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 36'', 83–102. doi:10.2307/2137289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House, J.S. (1974). Occupational stress and coronary heart disease: A review and theoretical integration. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 15'', 12–27. doi:10.2307/2136922&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review&lt;ref&gt;Häusser, J. A., Mojzisch, A., Niesel, M. &amp; Schulz-Hardt, S. (2010).

''BMC Public Health, 15'', 738. doi:10.1186/s12889-015-1954-4&lt;/ref&gt; of high-quality longitudinal studies link high demands, low control, and low support to psychological symptoms.

==== Psychosocial working conditions====
Parkes (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, K.R. (1982). Occupational stress among student nurses: A natural experiment. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 67'', 784–796. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.67.6.784&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relation of working conditions to psychological distress in British student nurses. She found that in this "[[natural experiment]]," student nurses experienced higher levels of distress and lower levels of job satisfaction in medical wards than in surgical wards; compared to surgical wards, medical wards make greater affective demands on the nurses. In another study, Frese (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Frese, M. (1985). Stress at work and psychosomatic complaints: A causal interpretation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 70'', 314–328. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.70.2.314&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that objective working conditions (e.g., noise, ambiguities, conflicts) give rise to subjective stress and psychosomatic symptoms in blue collar German workers. In addition to the above studies, a number of other well-controlled longitudinal studies have implicated work stressors in the development of psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Carayon, P. (1992).  A longitudinal study of job design and worker strain: Preliminary results. In J.C. Quick, L.R. Murphy, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Work and well-being:  Assessments and instruments for occupational mental health'' (pp. 19–32). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. doi:10.1037/10116-002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dormann, C., &amp; Zapf, D. (2002). Social stressors at work, irritation, and depressive symptoms: Accounting for unmeasured third variables in a multi-wave study. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75'', 33–58. doi:10.1348/096317902167630&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment ====
A comprehensive meta-analysis involving 86 studies indicated that involuntary job loss is linked to increased psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, K. I., &amp; Moser, K. (2009). Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 74'', 264–282. doi:10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of involuntary unemployment was comparatively weaker in countries that had greater income equality and better social safety nets.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; The research evidence also indicates that poorer mental health slightly, but significantly, increases the risk of later job loss.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

==== Economic insecurity ====
Some OHP research is concerned with (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' physical and mental health and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis.&lt;ref name="probst sears"&gt;Probst, T.M., &amp; Sears, L.E. (2009). Stress during the financial crisis. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5'', 3–4. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV5January2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological distress and work-family conflict.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"&gt;Sinclair, R.R., Probst, T., Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schaffer, M.M. (2013). Low income families and occupational health: Implications of economic stress for work-family conflict research and practice. In A.G. Antoniou &amp; C.L. Cooper (Eds.), ''The psychology of the recession on the workplace'' (pp. 308–323). Northampton, MA, US: Edward Elgar Publishing. doi:10.4337/9780857933843.00030&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing job insecurity, even in the absence of job loss, is related to higher levels of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and worse overall health.&lt;ref name="Burgard"&gt;Burgard, S.A., Brand, J.E., &amp; House, J.S. (2009). Perceived job insecurity and worker health in the United States. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 69'', 777–785. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.06.029.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work-family balance ====
{{Main|Work–family conflict|Double burden|Work–life balance}}

Employees must balance their working lives with their home lives. Work–family conflict is a situation in which the demands of work conflict with the demands of family or vice versa, making it difficult to adequately do both, giving rise to distress.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"&gt;Greenhaus, J.G., &amp; Allen, T. (2011). Work-family balance: A review and extension. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 165–183). Washington DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more research has been conducted on work-family conflict, there is also the phenomenon of work-family enhancement, which occurs when positive effects carry over from one domain into the other.&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"/&gt;

=== Workplace interventions ===
A number of stress management interventions have emerged that have shown demonstrable effects in reducing job stress.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Richardson, K. M., &amp; Rothstein, H. R. (2008). Effects of occupational stress management intervention programs: A meta-analysis. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13'', 69–93. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.13.1.69&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral interventions have tended to have greatest impact on stress reduction.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

====Industrial organizations====
OHP interventions often concern both the health of the individual and the health of the organization. Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention,  an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, J.A. (1999). Promoting organizational health: The evolving practice of occupational health psychology. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30''(2), 129 137. doi:10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.129&lt;/ref&gt; The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, conflict mediation, and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery.

Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) detailed a different, multi-layered intervention in a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;Hugentobler, M.K., Israel, B.A., &amp; Schurman, S.J. (1992). An action research approach to workplace health: Integrating methods. ''Health Education Quarterly, 19''(1), 55–76. doi:10.1177/109019819201900105&lt;/ref&gt; The hub of the intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both their well-being and [[productivity]]. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had a positive impact on productivity.

==== OHP research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ====
{{Main|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}
Currently there are efforts under way at NIOSH to help reduce the incidence of preventable disorders (e.g., [[sleep apnea]]) among heavy-truck and tractor-trailer drivers and, concomitantly, the life-threatening accidents to which the disorders lead,&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock, E. (2008). NIOSH OHP activities. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 3'', 10. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV3May2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; improve the health and safety of workers who are assigned to shift work or who work long hours,&lt;ref&gt;Caruso, C.

[http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV9October2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military and first responders====
The Mental Health Advisory Teams of the United States Army employ OHP-related interventions with combat troops.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J.L. (2008). OHP Research and Practice in the US Army: Mental Health Advisory Teams. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 4'', 4–5.

''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 7'', 6–7.[http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modestly scaled interventions====
Schmitt (2007) described three different modestly scaled OHP-related interventions that helped workers abstain from smoking, exercise more frequently, and shed weight.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2007). OHP interventions: Wellness programs. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other OHP interventions include a campaign to improve the rates of hand washing, an effort to get workers to walk more often, and a drive to get employees to be more compliant with regard to taking prescribed medicines.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2008). OHP interventions: Wellness programs (Part 2). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2'', 6–7. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV2January2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The interventions tended reduce organization health-care costs.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"/&gt;

==== Health promotion ====

Organizations can play a role in the health behavior of employees by providing resources to encourage healthy behavior in areas of exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J.B., Cook, R.F., &amp; Pelletier, K.R. (2011). An integral framework for organizational wellness: Core technology, practice models, and case studies In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 95–118). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
Although the dimensions of the problem of workplace violence vary by economic sector, one sector, [[school violence#Prevention and intervention|education]], has had some limited success in introducing programmatic, psychologically-based efforts to reduce the level of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 169–229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED494566.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that there continue to be difficulties in successfully "screening out applicants [for jobs] who may be prone to engaging in aggressive behavior,"&lt;ref&gt;Day, A.L, &amp; Catano, V.M. (2006) Screening and selecting out violent employees. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 549–577). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that aggression-prevention training of existing employees may be an alternative to screening. Only a small number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training programs to reduce workplace violence currently exist.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Training as a workplace aggression intervention strategy. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 579–605). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total Worker Health™====
{{Main|Total Worker Health}}

Because many companies have implemented worker safety and health measures in a fragmented way,&lt;ref name = "Schill"&gt;Schill, A. L., &amp; Chosewood, L. C. (2013). The NIOSH Total Worker Health™ program: An overview. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55''(12 Suppl.), S8–S11. doi:10.1097/JOM.0000000000000037&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach to worker safety and health has emerged in response, driven by efforts advanced by [[NIOSH]]. NIOSH trademarked that approach, naming it Total Worker Health. Total Worker Health involves the coordination of evidence-based (a) health promotion practices at the level of the individual worker and (b) umbrella-like health and safety practices at the level of the organizational unit.&lt;ref name = "Schill"/&gt; Research findings indicate that this two-pronged approach is effective in preventing work-related illness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;Anger, W. K., Elliot, D. L., Bodner, T., Olson, R., Rohlman, D. S., Truxillo, D. M., &amp; ... Montgomery, D. (2015). Effectiveness of Total Worker Health interventions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 20'', 226–247. doi:10.1037/a0038340&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents and safety===
{{Main|Work accident}}

Psychological factors are an important factor in [[occupational accident]]s that can lead to injury and death of employees. An important influence on the incidence of accidents is the organization's [[safety climate]] that is employees' shared beliefs about how supervisors reward and support safety behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. ''Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42'', 1517–1522. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2009.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''operating point''' is a specific point within the operation [[Receiver operating characteristic|characteristic]] of a technical device. This point will be engaged because of the properties of the system and the outside influences and parameters. 
In [[electronic engineering]] establishing an operating point is called [[biasing]].

== Wanted and unwanted operating points of a system ==
[[File:operating point stable.png|thumb|Operating point of a system consisting of drive (AC motor) and working machine (pump)]]
The operating point of a system is the intersection point of the torque-speed curve of drive and machine. Both devices are linked with a shaft so the speed is always identical. The drive creates the torque which rotates both devices. The machine creates the counter-torque, e.g. by being a moved device which needs permanent energy or a wheel turning against the static friction of the track.

* The drive speed increases when the driving torque is higher than the counter-torque.
* The drive speed decreases when the counter-torque is higher than the driving torque.
 
At the operating point the driving torque and the counter-torque are balanced, hence the speed does not change anymore.

* A speed change in a stable operating point creates a torque change which acts against this change of speed.

A change in speed out of this stable operating point is only possible with a new control intervention. This can be changing the load of the machine or the power of the drive which both changes the torque because it is a change in the characteristic curves. The drive-machine system then runs to a new operating point with a different speed and a different balance of torques.
 
Should the drive torque be higher than the counter torque at any time then the system does not have an operating point. The result will be that the speed increases up to the idle speed or even until destruction. Should the counter torque be higher at any times the speed will decrease until the system stops.

== Stable and unstable operating points ==

[[File:operating point instable.png|thumb|Unstable operating point of an engine consisting of drive (AC motor) and working machine (pump)]]
Also in case of an unstable operating point the law of the balance of the torques is always valid. But when the operating point is unstable then the characteristics of drive and machine are nearly parallel. In such a case a small change in torque will result in a big change of speed. In practice no device has a characteristics which is so thin that the intersection point can be clearly expected. Because of parallel characteristics, inner and outer friction as well as mechanical imperfections the unstable operating point is rather a band of possible operating states instead of a point. Running at an unstable operating point is therefore undesirable.

The middle point on the curve in the third picture on the right is an unstable point, too. However the above-mentioned assumptions are not valid here. Torque and speed are the same but in case the speed will be increased only little then the torque of the drive will be much higher than the counter-torque of the machine. The same but vice versa applies when reducing the speed.  For this reason this operating point does not have a stabilizing effect on the speed. The speed will run away to the left or the right side of the point and the drive will run stable there.

== Wanted and unwanted operating points ==

[[File:operating points wanted unwanted.png|thumb|Wanted and unwanted operating points of an engine]]
In the lower right picture the electrical drive (AC motor) moves a conveyor belt. This type of machine has a nearly constant counter-torque over the whole range of speed. By choosing the incorrect drive (incorrect in size and type) there will be three possible operating points with the necessary working torque. Naturally the operating point with the highest speed is needed because only there will be the highest mechanical power (which is proportional to torque times speed). At the other operating points the majority of the electrical power (proportional only to the torque) will be only converted into heat inside the drive. Despite the bad power balance the drive can also overheat this way.
 
In the example shown in picture three the desired right operating point with same torque but higher speed (and therefore higher power) cannot be reached alone after starting the drive. The reason is the technically induced decrease of the drive characteristics in the middle of the curve. The speed will reach this area but not increase further. In case of such machines with constant torques a coupling can be used to prevent stopping during start up, it should be rotation speed dependent. (Of course a motor bigger in size would also do, but this is not as economical). With the coupling the counter torque will only be introduced when the load-less drive has reached a speed outside of the unstable working point. Then the drive can safely speed up. Alternatively a drive with an adequate characteristic can be chosen. In the past [[Brushed DC electric motor#Shunt wound motor|shunt-motors]] have been used for this purpose, nowadays asynchronous [[AC motor]]s are being used or AC motors in combination with a [[Variable-frequency drive|variable frequency drive]].

==Electronics==
In an electronic [[amplifier]], an operating point is a combination of current and voltage at "no signal" conditions; application of a signal to the stage - changes voltage and current in the stage. The operating point in an [[amplifier]] is set by the intersection of the [[load line(electronics)|load line]] with the non-linear characteristics of the device.  By adjusting the bias on the stage, an operating point can be selected that maximizes the signal output of the stage and minimizes distortion.

A '''pathovar''' is a [[bacteria]]l strain or set of strains with the same or similar characteristics, that is differentiated at infrasubspecific level from other strains of the same species or subspecies on the basis of distinctive pathogenicity to one or more [[plant]] hosts.

Pathovars are named as a ternary or quaternary addition to the species binomial name, for example the bacterium that causes [[citrus canker]] ''Xanthomonas axonopodis'', has several pathovars with different host ranges,  ''X. axonopodis'' pv. ''citri'' is one of them; the abbreviation 'pv.' means pathovar.

The [[type (biology)|type]] strains of pathovars are '''pathotypes''', which are distinguished from the types (holotype, neotype, etc.) of the species to which the pathovar belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.isppweb.org/about_tppb_naming.asp |title=International Standards for Naming Pathovars of Phytopathogenic Bacteria |author1=J.M.

This process takes place almost continuously as a "[[marine snow]]" of descending particles, falling at the rate of about {{convert|100|to|150|m|0|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=Gooday/&gt; Under certain conditions, phytoplankton may aggregate and fall rapidly through the [[water column]] to arrive little changed on the seabed. These fluxes sometimes occur seasonally or periodically, are sometimes associated with [[algal bloom]]s and may constitute the greater part of descending organic matter. If the amount is greater than the [[benthos|benthic]] [[detritivore]]s can process, the phytodetritus forms a fluffy layer on the surface of the sediment. It accumulates in many shallow and deep water locations throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oceanography and Marine Biology, An Annual Review, Volume 40 |last=Gibson |first=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">'''Phytomers''' are functional units of a plant, continually produced by root and shoot [[meristem]]s throughout a plant's vegetative life-cycle. The phytomer unit originates at the shoot (or root) apex, and a typical phytomer consists of a node to which a leaf is attached, a subtending internode, and an [[axillary bud]] at the base of the leaf. Each component of a phytomer can continue to differentiate and grow. Increases in a phytomer can be measured using the rate of [[phyllochron]] (rate of appearance of leaves on a shoot). Related to the phyllochron is the [[plastochron]], which is the rate of leaf primordia initiation. Since many more leaf primordia are initiated than leaves develop, the plastochron develops at a much faster rate (sometimes as much as twice as quickly) as the phyllochron.

Initially, a young plant will only produce phytomers at its apical meristems but later in development, secondary meristems will begin to form and phytomers will be formed on this lateral plant growth.

A '''private defense agency''' ('''PDA''') is an enterprise which would provide personal protection and [[military|military defense]] services to individuals who would voluntarily contract for its services. PDAs are advocated in [[anarcho-capitalism]] and market-based forms of [[social anarchism]], such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A PDA is distinguished from a [[Private military company|private contractor]] of the state which is [[Subsidy|subsidized]] financially through [[taxation]] or legally through [[monopoly]] and [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]], and relies on [[conscription]] and other involuntary support. Instead, such agencies would be voluntarily financed primarily by competing [[insurance]] and [[security]] companies, which are penalized for losses and damages, and have a financial incentive to minimize waste and maximize quality of service.

==Theory==
As proponents of [[free-market anarchism]],
[[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin,''The Relation of the State to the Individual'', 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker |first=Benjamin |title=Liberty and Taxation |journal=[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustave de Molinari]] first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies.
The concept later was advanced and expanded upon by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] who consider the state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The [[Mises Institute]] published a book of essays entitled ''[[The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Mises Review (Vol. 10, No. 1; Spring 2004) A summary is given in a review by David Gordon [https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=247&amp;sortorder=issue].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray N. Rothbard]] in ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'' and [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a [[privatization|privatized]] system of [[law]], [[police]], [[court]]s, [[insurance companies]] and [[arbitration]] agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, [[victimless crime]]s and "crimes against the state" would be rendered [[Mootness|moot]], and the legal realm would be limited to [[contract]]ual disputes and [[tort]] damages, as from [[assault]], [[burglary]], [[pollution]], and all other forms of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard133.html |title=Society without a State |journal=[[The Libertarian Forum]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=January 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Friedman, [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html Police, Courts, and Laws---on the Market], [http://daviddfriedman.com David Friedman home page].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is similar to [[Polycentric law]]. Within [[economics]], discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the [[Austrian School]], as in [[Hans Hoppe]]'s article "The Private Production of Defense" published by the [[Mises Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans |last=Hoppe |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |format=[[PDF]] | title=The Private Production of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing [[Statism|statist]] defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of law, as is true of [[Sovereign state|states]]. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs minimize offensive tendencies and [[Militarism|militarization]] in favor of a pure defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and [[decentralization]] of defense would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state.

As a private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. [[John Frederic Kosanke]] argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the greater number of [[proprietor]]s makes [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] more costly to an aggressor than a relatively authoritarian region, [[vulnerability]] to attack is less likely. Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to neighboring regions, official or [[Ideology|ideological]] justification by those neighbors for attacking them is also proportionately diminished.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederic Kosanke, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/johnfkosanke/Civilization101.html%23biv&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:56:26 "Civilization 101 - Elements of Security"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of monopoly power===
Hoppe points out that there is a contradiction in the beliefs of most philosophers and economists in reference to national defense. They generally hold that any [[monopoly]] is "bad" for consumers because, shielded from potential new entrants into his area of production, the price of his product X will be higher and its quality lower than otherwise. Yet they simultaneously hold that security must be undertaken by the government, which is a territorial monopoly of law and order (the ultimate decision maker and enforcer). Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|chapter=Introduction|pages=3–4|author=Hoppe, Hans-Hermann|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/web/2716 The Production of Security&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of the consumer, it is in the consumer's best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and of trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.}}
Tyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the [[cartel]]'s market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency [[arbitration agreement]]s, Cowen opines, "The adjudication network is stable only if it can use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms that do not adhere to the collusive agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rejoinder to David Friedman on the Economics of Anarchy|author=Cowen, Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalist]]s argue that competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.

===Aggression and abuses by private defense agencies===
[[Randall G. Holcombe]] argues that "Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive." Holcombe states that [[mafia]]s offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leeson]] and [[Edward Stringham]] rebut this argument by claiming that unless the firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on a larger state explains why violent confrontations between states are less common than between individuals in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]; in other words, it is not the size of the group in question that matters, since in either case being the aggressor is likely to bring about undesirable risks and diminution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Government Inevitable? Comment on Holcombe's Analysis|author1=Leeson, Peter  |author2=Stringham, Edward P  |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=1674461 |journal=[[Independent Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism. Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute; or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression. The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by [[sovereign immunity]]. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to be involved with such an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=109–111|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that a defense company would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it "couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=115|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard makes a similar point, noting, "Of course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, ''legalized'' channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument ''de novo'' is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State with Power and Market|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1054|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued, "If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that warehouse."&lt;ref name=Villacampa&gt;{{Cite journal|title=In a State of Anarchy|author=Villacampa, Alexander|publisher=Grove City College|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other services in an anarcho-capitalist society, "We must consider that in such an environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts."&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/story/1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay, ''The Price of Private Law'', which argues, "If two defense firms are engaged in a truly ‘local’ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into the crossfire." Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Price of Private Law|author=Bond, Jonathan C.|date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villacampa notes that consumers with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating "There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of whether they are use or not." He argues an alliance of aggressor private defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: "Chances are high that a mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods, they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders."&lt;ref name=Villacampa/&gt;

===Financing of private defense agencies===
Defense is often viewed as an archetypical [[public good]]{{spaced ndash}}i.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its [[non-excludability]] and [[non-rivalrous consumption]]. Specifically, the [[free rider problem]], in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say "Who cares?" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, "Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1037|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the [[American Revolution]] occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on "nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on," some of which might represent "[[enlightened self interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|pages=237–238|chapter=Mercenaries, Militias, Guerrillas, and the Defense of Minimal States and Free Societies|author=Stromberg, Joseph R.|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda and Morris Tannehill]] believe that big businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Foreign Aggression|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=131|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of [[subrogation]], and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the "altruistic" insurer out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no-treason.com/archives/2001/06/ No Treason » 2001 » June&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable [[collection cost]]s), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as [[privateer]]s did in the 18th and 19th centuries under [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Sechrest, Larry J. |authorlink=Larry J. Sechrest |chapter=Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=258|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war also used to have [[shadow price]]s (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Radnitzky, Gerard|chapter=Is Democracy More Peaceful than Other Forms of Government?|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=147|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes arguments are made for voluntary funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no [[demonstrated preference]] has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Block, Walter|chapter=National Defense and the Theory of Externalities, Public Goods, and Clubs|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=310|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples of widespread use==

===Ancient Europe===
Ancient city-states in Greece and Rome depended on [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgy]]{{spaced ndash}}contributions made by rich citizens for specific purposes{{spaced ndash}}for defense. A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the [[Second Punic War]], [[Quintus Maximus Fabius Verrucosus]] used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] used their own resources to suppress the armies of [[Spartacus]] in the [[Third Servile War]]. [[Julius Caesar]] made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by [[Gallic Wars|conquering]] [[Gaul]]. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes to be disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the State|author=van Creveld, Martin|pages=32–33, 207|isbn=0-521-65629-X|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Iceland===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
According to [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], "[[Icelandic Commonwealth|Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an anarcho-capitalist society&amp;nbsp;– while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"/&gt;

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The [[land club]]s and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L.

===Post-Feudal Sicily===
The Mafia began in the 19th century.  Modern scholars believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism.&lt;ref name=Gambetta1993p94&gt;{{harvp|Gambetta|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith. ''A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713''. p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices,&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; the loss of public and church lands,&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt; and the loss of feudal [[common rights|commons]] pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors.  These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50331">{{Fats}}
A '''saturated fat''' is a type of [[fat]] in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly [[single bond]]s.  A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]]. Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by [[double bond]]s (-C=C-).&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reece, Jane |author2=Campbell, Neil |title=Biology|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|year=2002|pages= 69–70|isbn=0-8053-6624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], because the second bond is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom. Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Saturated fats tend to have higher [[melting point]]s than their corresponding unsaturated fats, leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures, while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity (meaning both saturated and unsaturated fats are found to be liquid at body temperature).

Various fats contain different proportions of saturated and [[unsaturated fat]].

==Fat profiles==
While nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups.  [[Lauric acid|Lauric]] and [[Myristic acid|myristic]] acids are most commonly found in "tropical" oils (e.g., [[Palm kernel oil|palm kernel]], [[Coconut oil|coconut]]) and dairy products.  The saturated fat in meat, [[egg (food)|eggs]], cacao, and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] is primarily the triglycerides of [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]] and [[Stearic acid|stearic]] acids.

==Association with diseases==

Since the 1950s, it has been demonstrated that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262 | title = Dietary fats: Know which types to choose | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]] | date = 2011-02-15 | accessdate = 2011-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fats and cholesterol|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/|publisher=Harvard University, TH Chan School of Public Health|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small, limited number of [[systematic reviews]] have examined the relationship between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and have come to different conclusions. However, these rely on observational studies and can therefore not be used to establish cause and effect relationships:

A 2017 systematic review by the American Heart Association of randomized controlled [[clinical trial]]s showed that reducing intake of dietary saturated fat and replacing it with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats could reduce cardiovascular disease by  about 30%, similar to the reduction achieved by [[statin]] treatment for maintaining [[blood cholesterol]] within normal limits.&lt;ref name=aha2017/&gt;

A different 2017 systematic review of randomized, controlled trials concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) events, CHD mortality or total mortality. The 2017 review showed that inadequately controlled trials (e.g., failing to control for other lifestyle factors) that were included in earlier meta-analyses explain the prior results.&lt;ref name="Hamley2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamley|first1=S|title=The effect of replacing saturated fat with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fat on coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials|journal=Nutrition Journal|date=May 2017|volume=16|issue=1|page=30|doi=10.1186/s12937-017-0254-5|pmid=28526025|pmc=5437600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 systematic review also found no association between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes. However, this study only looked at observational studies, and can therefore not be used to determine cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intake of saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids and risk of all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=BMJ|date=Aug 12, 2015|volume=351|issue=h3978|doi=10.1136/bmj.h3978|pmid=26268692|pmc=4532752|author=de Souza RJ, Mente A, Maroleanu A, Cozma AI, Ha V, Kishibe T, Uleryk E, Budylowski P, Schünemann H, Beyene J, Anand SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 systematic review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings ″do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chowdhury R, Warnakula S, Kunutsor S, Crowe F, Ward HA, Johnson L, Franco OH, Butterworth AS, Forouhi NG, Thompson SG, Khaw KT, Mozaffarian D, Danesh J, Di Angelantonio E | title = Association of dietary, circulating, and supplement fatty acids with coronary risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Ann.

====Dyslipidemia====
{{See also|Lipid hypothesis}}
The consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for [[dyslipidemia]], which in turn is a risk factor for some types of [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url =  http://www.fph.org.uk/uploads/ps_fat.pdf | title = Position Statement on Fat | author = Faculty of Public Health of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom | accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/docs/who_fao_expert_report.pdf | title = Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases | publisher = World Health Organization | author = Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cholesterol | url = http://www.irishheart.ie/iopen24/cholesterol-t-7_20_87.html | accessdate = 2011-02-28 | publisher  = Irish Heart Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Abnormal blood lipid levels, that is high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL, "bad" cholesterol) or low levels of [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL, "good" cholesterol) cholesterol are all associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;ref name=WorldHeartFederation /&gt;

===Cancer===

====Breast cancer====
{{Main|Epidemiology and etiology of breast cancer#Specific dietary fatty acids}}

A meta-analysis published in 2003 found a significant positive relationship in both control and cohort studies between saturated fat and breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyd NF, Stone J, Vogt KN, Connelly BS, Martin LJ, Minkin S | title = Dietary fat and breast cancer risk revisited: a meta-analysis of the published literature | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume =  89| issue = 9 | pages = 1672–1685 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14583769 | pmc = 2394401 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However two subsequent reviews have found weak or insignificant associations of saturated fat intake and breast cancer risk,&lt;ref name=Hanf&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanf V, Gonder U | title = Nutrition and primary prevention of breast cancer: foods, nutrients and breast cancer risk. | journal = European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology | volume = 123 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–149 | date = 2005-12-01 | pmid = 16316809 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2005.05.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lof M, Weiderpass E | title = Impact of diet on breast cancer risk. | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–85 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19125007 | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32831d7f22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and note the prevalence of confounding factors.&lt;ref name=Hanf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freedman LS, Kipnis V, Schatzkin A, Potischman N | title = Methods of Epidemiology: Evaluating the Fat–Breast Cancer Hypothesis – Comparing Dietary Instruments and Other Developments | journal = Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.) | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–74 | date = Mar–Apr 2008 | pmid = 18391610 | pmc = 2496993 | doi = 10.1097/PPO.0b013e31816a5e02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colorectal cancer====
One review found limited evidence for a positive relationship between consuming animal fat and incidence of colorectal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Methods Mol Biol|year=2009|volume=472|pages=361–72|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_16|title=Acquired risk factors for colorectal cancer|author=Lin OS|pmid=19107442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovarian cancer====
A meta-analysis of eight observational studies published in 2001 found a statistically significant positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huncharek M, Kupelnick B | title = Dietary fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis of 6,689 subjects from 8 observational studies | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–91 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11962260 | doi = 10.1207/S15327914NC402_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a 2013 study found that a pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies observed no association between total fat intake and ovarian cancer risk.    Further analysis revealed that omega-3 fatty acids were protective against ovarian cancer and that trans fats were a risk factor.&lt;ref&gt;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/73/8_MeetingAbstracts/148{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study revealed that histological subtypes should be examined in determining the impact of dietary fat on ovarian cancer, rather than an oversimplified focus on total fat intake.

====Prostate cancer====

Some researchers have indicated that serum [[myristic acid]]&lt;ref name="pmid14693732"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Männistö S, Pietinen P, Virtanen MJ, Salminen I, Albanes D, Giovannucci E, Virtamo J | title = Fatty acids and risk of prostate cancer in a nested case-control study in male smokers | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 1422–8 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14693732 | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14693732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saturated"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crowe FL, Allen NE, Appleby PN, Overvad K, Aardestrup IV, Johnsen NF, Tjønneland A, Linseisen J, Kaaks R, Boeing H, Kröger J, Trichopoulou A, Zavitsanou A, Trichopoulos D, Sacerdote C, Palli D, Tumino R, Agnoli C, Kiemeney LA, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Chirlaque MD, Ardanaz E, Larrañaga N, Quirós JR, Sánchez MJ, González CA, Stattin P, Hallmans G, Bingham S, Khaw KT, Rinaldi S, Slimani N, Jenab M, Riboli E, Key TJ | title = Fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and risk of prostate cancer in a case-control analysis nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 88 | issue = 5 | pages = 1353–63 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18996872 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18996872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[palmitic acid]]&lt;ref name="saturated"/&gt;  and dietary myristic&lt;ref name="palmiticmyristic"/&gt; and palmitic&lt;ref name="palmiticmyristic"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurahashi N, Inoue M, Iwasaki M, Sasazuki S, Tsugane AS | title = Dairy product, saturated fatty acid, and calcium intake and prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of Japanese men | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 930–7 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18398033 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with [[Tocopherol#Alpha-tocopherol|alpha-tocopherol]] supplementation&lt;ref name="pmid14693732"/&gt; are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.&lt;ref name="saturated"/&gt;

===Bones===
Mounting evidence indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health. Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies. The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake, and that men may be particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corwin RL, Hartman TJ, Maczuga SA, Graubard BI | title = Dietary saturated fat intake is inversely associated with bone density in humans: Analysis of NHANES III | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–165 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16365076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==

In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded that "intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42665/1/WHO_TRS_916.pdf |title= Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (WHO technical report series 916) |publisher= World Health Organization |author = Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation |year= 2003 |pages=81–94 |isbn= 92-4-120916-X |accessdate = 2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.  Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor."&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

A 2004 statement released by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) determined that "Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intake…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/mmwrnews/n040206.htm#mmwr2 | title = Trends in Intake of Energy, Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat, and Saturated Fat — United States, 1971–2000 | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control]] | year = 2004 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081201152506/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/mmwrnews/n040206.htm#mmwr2 | archivedate = 2008-12-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, reviews by the [[American Heart Association]] led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alice H. Lichtenstein|Lichtenstein AH]], Appel LJ, Brands M, Carnethon M, Daniels S, Franch HA, Franklin B, Kris-Etherton P, Harris WS, Howard B, Karanja N, Lefevre M, Rudel L, Sacks F, Van Horn L, Winston M, Wylie-Rosett J | title = Diet and lifestyle recommendations revision 2006: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee | journal = Circulation | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–96 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16785338 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.176158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith SC, Jackson R, Pearson TA, Fuster V, Yusuf S, Faergeman O, Wood DA, Alderman M, Horgan J, Home P, Hunn M, Grundy SM | title = Principles for national and regional guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention: a scientific statement from the World Heart and Stroke Forum | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | issue = 25 | pages = 3112–21 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15226228 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000133427.35111.67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concurs with similar conclusions made by the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease.&lt;ref name=DGfA&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06q0458/06q-0458-sup0001-02.pdf | format = pdf | title = Dietary Guidelines for Americans | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]], [[National Health Service]] claims the majority of British people eat too much saturated fat. The [[British Heart Foundation]] also advises people to cut down on saturated fat. People are advised to cut down on saturated fat and read labels on food they buy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx Eat less saturated fat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/preventing-heart-disease/healthy-eating/fats-explained Fats explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 review stated that "no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified" and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=German JB, Dillard CJ | title = Saturated fats: what dietary intake? | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 550–559 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15321792 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/80/3/550.full | accessdate = 2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the [[American Dietetic Association]] for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates.  Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s which may have health benefits.  None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zelman K | title = The Great Fat Debate: A Closer Look at the Controversy—Questioning the Validity of Age-Old Dietary Guidance | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 111 | issue = 5 | pages = 655–658 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21515106 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2011.03.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 comprehensive review of the literature and clinical trials, the American Heart Association published a recommendation that saturated fat intake be reduced or replaced by products containing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, a dietary adjustment that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.&lt;ref name=aha2017/&gt;

==Molecular description==
[[File:Myristic acid.svg|thumb|left|500px|Two-dimensional representation of the saturated fatty acid [[myristic acid]]]]
[[File:Myristic-acid-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|500px|A [[space-filling model]] of the saturated fatty acid [[myristic acid]]]]  It should be noted, as this is the defining factor of '''saturated''' fats, that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the [[myristic acid]] molecule (there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail; 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule).

Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are  portrayed as [[Line-line intersection|intersections]] between two straight lines.  "Saturated," in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the [[Octet Rule]].  This also means that only [[single bond]]s ([[sigma bonds]]) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.

A '''spherical roller thrust bearing''' is a [[rolling-element bearing]] of [[Thrust bearing|thrust type]] that permits rotation with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing is designed to take radial loads, and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the shaft washer that may be misaligned in respect to the housing washer. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the house washer.&lt;ref name=misalignment&gt;{{cite web|title=Misalignment|url=http://www.skf.com/us/products/bearings-units-housings/roller-bearings/spherical-roller-bearings/misalignment/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Spherical roller thrust bearings constitute of a shaft washer (for radial bearings often called "inner ring"), a housing washer (for radial bearings often called "outer ring"), asymmetrical rollers and a cage.&lt;ref name="SKF SRTB"&gt;{{cite book|title=SKF Spherical roller thrust bearings|year=2010|publisher=SKF|url=http://www.skf.com/binary/12-121034/06104_1-EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also bearing units available that can take axial loads in two directions.

==History==
The spherical roller thrust bearing was introduced by [[SKF]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early history|url=http://www.skf.com/group/our-company/skf-history/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=17 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116060342/http://www.skf.com/group/our-company/skf-history/index.html|archivedate=16 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the early bearings is similar to the design that is still in use in modern machines.

==Designs==
[[File:Schema Roller thrust bearing, self-aligning.svg|thumb|Section view of a spherical roller thrust bearing]]

The internal design of the bearing is not standardised by ISO, so it varies between different manufacturers and different series. Some of the design parameters are:
* Roller shape and dimensions
* Flange design
* Non-rotational notches in house washer

The spherical roller thrust bearings have the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings.&lt;ref name=WhySRTB&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Spherical roller thrust bearings|url=http://www.skf.com/binary/12-101526/Why-SKF-sheet-for-SRTB---6548_EN.pdf|work=6548/1|publisher=SKF|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
External dimensions of spherical roller bearings are standardised by [[ISO]] in the standard ISO 104:2002.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dimensions|url=http://www.skf.com/group/products/bearings-units-housings/ball-bearings/principles/bearing-data-general/dimensions/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some common series of spherical roller bearings are:
* 292
* 293
* 294

==Materials==
Bearing rings and rolling elements can be made of a number of different materials, but the most common is "chrome steel", a material with approximately 1.5% chrome content. Such "chrome steel" has been standardized by a number of authorities, and there are therefore a number of similar materials, such as: AISI 52100 (USA), 100CR6 (Germany), SUJ2 (Japan) and GCR15 (China).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bearing materials|url=http://www.astbearings.com/bearing-materials.html|publisher=AST Bearings|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common materials for bearing cages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cage materials|url=http://www.skf.com/group/products/bearings-units-housings/roller-bearings/principles/bearing-data-general/materials-for-rolling-bearings/cage-materials/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sheet steel]] (stamped or laser-cut)
* [[Brass]] (stamped or machined)
* [[Steel]] (machined)

The choice of material is mainly done by the manufacturing volume and method. For large-volume bearings, cages are often of stamped sheet-metal, whereas low volume series often have cages of machined brass or machined steel.

==Manufacturers==
Some manufacturers of ''spherical roller bearings'' are [[SKF]], [[Schaeffler]], [[Timken Company]] and [[NSK Ltd.]].

==Applications==
Spherical roller thrust bearings are used in industrial applications, where there are heavy axial loads, moderate speeds and possibly misalignment.
Some common application areas are:&lt;ref name=WhySRTB /&gt;

* [[Transmission (mechanics)|Gearboxes]]
* [[Pulp and paper]] processing equipment (notably refiners)
* [[Marine propulsion]] and [[offshore drilling]]
* [[Crane (machine)|Cranes]] and [[swing bridge]]s
* [[Water turbine]]s
* [[Plastics extrusion|Extruders]] for injection molding

&lt;/score&gt;|width=120|caption=Three notes with staccato dots}}'''Staccato''' ({{IPA-it|stakˈkaːto|}}; Italian for "detached") is a form of [[Articulation (music)|musical articulation]]. In modern notation, it signifies a note of shortened duration,&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1960), p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy, ed., {{Full|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--The page citation is nice, but it is customary to cite dictionary entries by title.--&gt;''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'', third edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt; separated from the note that may follow by silence.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew, "Staccato", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by theorists and has appeared in music since at least 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Bachmann, Robert E. Seletsky, [[David D. Boyden]], Jaak Liivoja-Lorius, Peter Walls, and Peter Cooke, "Bow", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==

}}
In 20th-century music, a dot placed above or below a note indicates that it should be played staccato, and a wedge is used for the more emphatic [[staccatissimo]]. However, before 1850, dots, dashes, and wedges were all likely to have the same meaning, even though some theorists from as early as the 1750s distinguished different degrees of staccato through the use of dots and dashes, with the dash indicating a shorter, sharper note, and the dot a longer, lighter one.  

A number of signs came to be used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to discriminate more subtle nuances of staccato. These signs involve various combinations of dots, vertical and horizontal dashes, vertical and horizontal wedges, and the like, but attempts to standardize these signs have not generally been successful.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew, "Staccato", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The example below illustrates the scope of the staccato dot:

:&lt;score&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    &lt;&lt; \clef treble
        \relative c' {
            \stemNeutral &lt;e c'&gt;-. &lt;g d'&gt;-. &lt;g e'&gt;-. &lt;c, c'&gt;-.
            \stemUp a'-. c-. c-. d-.
        } \\ {
            s1
            f'4 f' g' g'
        }
    &gt;&gt;

}
&lt;/score&gt;

In the first measure, the pairs of notes are in the same musical [[Part (music)|part]] (or voice) since they are on a common stem. The staccato applies to both notes of the pairs. In the second measure, the pairs of notes are stemmed separately indicating two different parts, so the staccato applies only to the upper note.

The opposite musical articulation of staccato is [[legato]], signifying long and continuous notes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy and Joyce Bourne, "Staccato", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music''{{Full|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--Third edition 1980 cited elsewhere in this article; is this the fourth, fifth, or some other edition?--&gt; (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; There is an intermediate articulation called either [[mezzo staccato]] or [[non legato]]. 

By default, in the music notation program [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]], "staccatos shorten a note by 50%."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Spreadbury, Michael Eastwood, Ben Finn, and Jonathan Finn, "Sibelius 5 Reference", edition 5.2 (March 2008), p.&amp;nbsp;284.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staccatissimo ==
In [[musical notation]], '''staccatissimo''' (plural: ''staccatissimi'' or the [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] form ''staccatissimos'') indicates that the notes are to be played extremely separated and distinct, a superlative staccato. This can be notated with little pikes over or under the notes, depending on [[Stem (music)|stem]] direction, as in this example from [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 0 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 0 in D minor]]:

: &lt;score&gt;
\new Score {
  \new Staff {
    \relative c' {
      \time 3/4
      \key d \minor
      \clef treble
      d8-&gt;(\ff cis d2~
      d4) a'-! d-!
      es-! e-! f-!
      fis-! g-! gis-!
      a8(-&gt; gis a4)
    }
  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Alternatively, it can be notated by writing the word "staccatissimo" or the abbreviation "staccatiss." over the staff. A few composers, such as Mozart, have used staccato dots accompanied by a written instruction ''staccatissimo'' when they mean the passage to be played ''staccatissimo''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Farkas, ''The Art of French Horn Playing'' (Evanston: Summy-Birchard Company, 1956): p.&amp;nbsp;51. {{ISBN|978-0-87487-021-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology''''' is a 2012 British [[documentary film]] directed by [[Sophie Fiennes]] and written and presented by Slovene [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[psychanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Slavoj Žižek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology: Toronto Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/perverts-guide-ideology-toronto-review-368821|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sequel to Fiennes's 2006 documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]''. Though the film follows the frameworks of its predecessor, this time the emphasis is on [[ideology]] itself. Through [[psychoanalysis]] Žižek explores "the mechanisms that shape what we believe and how we behave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervert's Guide to Cinema's Fiennes and Žižek Reteam for ''Pervert's Guide to Ideology''|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/perverts_guide_to_cinemas_fiennes_and_zizek_reteam_for_perverts_guide_to_id|publisher=indiewire.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the films that are explored are ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' and ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leigh|first=Danny|title=Slavoj Žižek: Blofeld rides again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/16/slavoj-zizek-perverts-guide-ideology|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the [[United States]] by [[Zeitgeist Films]] in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perverts Uprising!

==Synopsis==
Žižek appears transplanted into the scenes of various movies, exploring and exposing how they reinforce prevailing ideologies.  As the ideologies undergirding cinematic fantasies are revealed, striking associations emerge: from nuns advising following your desires at ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' to the political dimensions of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.  ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'', ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[They Live]]'' ("one of the forgotten masterpieces of the Hollywood Left"), ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', [[Kinder Surprise]] eggs, verité news footage, the emptiness of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]’s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|"Ode to Joy"]], and [[propaganda]] epics from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Russia]] all inform Žižek’s psychoanalytic-cinematic argument.

==Reception==
"Though its ideas are indeed heady and high-flown, they are presented in a way that's consistently engaging and accessible. And the bearded, bulky, Slovenia-born Žižek comes across as a born raconteur and explainer, the kind of professor whose courses are deservedly his department's most popular. You don't have to share his materialist philosophy to find his analyses of culture and movies witty, insightful and usefully thought-provoking."
—Godfrey Cheshire, [[RogerEbert.com]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Godfrey|title=''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology''|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-perverts-guide-to-ideology-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What remains? You will get a lot of answers to questions you never knew you had."
—Anne-Katrin Titze, Eye for Film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Titze|first=Anne-Katrin|title=''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology''|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/the-perverts-guide-to-ideology-2012-film-review-by-anne-katrin-titze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Intellectual rock star Slavoj Žižek dishes out another action-packed lesson in film history and Marxist dialectics with ''The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology'', a riveting and often hilarious demonstration of the Slovenian philosopher’s uncanny ability to turn movies inside out and accepted notions on their head."
—Jordan Mintzer, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mintzer|first=Jordan|title=''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology'': Toronto Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/perverts-guide-ideology-toronto-review-368821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Žižek’s romp through pop culture feels like a strange dream, with a mad professor re-enacting our favourite movie moments through the eyes of a therapist. ''The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology'' is invigorating, zany, completely memorable and often hilarious. Žižek goes from praising Coca-Cola to analyzing what the shark attacks really mean in ''Jaws''."
—Matthew Hays, ''Rover Arts Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hays|first=Matthew|title=Deconstructing Hollywood|url=http://roverarts.com/2013/02/deconstructing-hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 92% based on reviews from 24 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|the_perverts_guide_to_ideology/|The Pervert's Guide to Ideology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory of Legal Norms''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Teoria della Norma Giuridica'') is a book, published in 1958, by the [[Italia]]n [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of [[philosophy of law|foundations of law]] &amp;mdash; the legal norm.

== Importance ==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=87|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in six chapters.

== Chapters&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ==
# Law as behavior rule: he shows three theories that lead, according to him, to a unique, non-paradoxical concept system: ''regulational'', ''intersubjective'' and ''institutional''.
# Discusses the two main schools of legal theory: [[legal positivism]] and theories of [[natural law]].
# Approaches the norm in its formal aspect, analyzing ''propositions'', ''prescriptions'', ''expressions'', ''imperatives'', ''commands'' and ''advices''.
# Discusses imperatives specifically, as well as their relationship with [[value judgement]]s, ''permissions'' and the addressees of a norm.
# ''Sanctions'' of norms (prescribed consequences of their violation); the necessity of sanctions to characterize a norm.
# Classifications of norms and the ''[[sine qua non]]'' character of ''[[generalization]]-[[abstraction]]''.

== Criticism ==
"In this book, Bobbio defends a ''positive'' philosophy committed to the scientific soul and against [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] points of view. Bobbio breaks from jusnaturalists tendencies, considering law as a speech to be submitted to the [[language]] analysis, inside the borderlines of a scientific theory, according to the paradigm of the [[logical positivism]]"&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/1708639-teoria-da-norma-jur%C3%ADdica/|title=Teoria da Norma Jurídica|date=19 November 2007|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bobbio presents his position about ''sanctions''. According to him, sanction is the response to violation of a law. Analyzing sanction under the point of view of efficacy, the relation between law and force appears. For [[Kelsen]], law exists to regulate force. For Bobbio, sanctions are means to obtain the ''desirable human behavior''. Bobbio emphasizes the positive sanctions (awards) in opposition to repressive ones."&lt;ref name="CIEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciashumanas.com.br/resumo_artigo_7097/artigo_sobre_o_pensamento_jur%C3%8Ddico_de_norberto_bobbio|title=O Pensamento Jurídico de Norberto Bobbio|publisher=Ciências Humanas.coml.br|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this book, Bobbio analyzes the ''law as rule of behavior'', showing a general view  and a criticism of the various theories that intend to reveal the concept of law, concluding that, although all the theories are integrated,  the normativist one prevails in sense of constituting pressuposed of validity for the other ones"&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/513/492|title=Bobbio, Norberto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1272">The '''triose phosphate translocator''' is an integral membrane protein found in the inner membrane of [[chloroplasts]]. It exports triose phosphate ([[Dihydroxyacetone phosphate]]) in exchange for inorganic phosphate and is therefore classified as an [[antiporter]]. The imported phosphate is then used for ATP regeneration via the light-dependent-reaction; the ATP may then for example be used for further reactions in the Calvin-cycle.The Translocator protein is responsible for exporting all the [[carbohydrate]] produced in [[photosynthesis]] by plants and therefore most of the carbon in food that one eats has been transported by the triose phosphate translocator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Walters | first1 = R.| last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = D.| last3 = Horton | first3 = P.| last4 = Kruger | first4 = N.| title = A mutant of Arabidopsis lacking the triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator reveals metabolic regulation of starch breakdown in the light| journal = Plant Physiology| volume = 135| issue = 2| pages = 891–906| year = 2004| pmid = 15173568| pmc = 514124| doi = 10.1104/pp.104.040469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">The skull and bones of a man buried between 9,800 and 10,200 years ago on [[San Miguel Island]], in California's [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]], were exposed by beach erosion and discovered and preserved in 2005 by [[University of Oregon]] archaeologists. The remains were dated by way of radiocarbon dating and evaluation of artifacts which had been intentionally buried with him. They were analyzed, but it was not possible to extract the Tuqan Man's DNA, though increasingly better testing techniques and methods became available and were utilized over the 12 years that passed after his original discovery. The remains were studied before their return to the island, which was delayed by resolution of tribal identification and ownership issues contingent on resolution of the precedent-setting [[Kennewick Man]] case from Washington State. Analysis of the bones indicated that he was in his forties when he died, and had spent time some distance east of what is now the Santa Barbara coastal region. Under procedures in accordance with the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), in May, 2018, they were restored to the claiming Chumash tribe, for reburial on the island. The [[Chumash people]] had long occupied the island before the arrival of the first European explorers, and the find was given the place name of the island in the [[Chumash language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/special-reports/outdoors/2018/06/13/ancient-remains-discovered-reburied-san-miguel-island-tuqan-man-channel-islands-santa-ynez-chumash/670609002/ Tuqan Man, human remains buried 10,000 years ago, found on the Channel Islands], ''[[Ventura County Star]]'', Cheri Carlson, June 13, 2018.

Archaeological research has shown that San Miguel Island was first settled by humans at least 12,000 years ago, when San Miguel was still part of the larger Santarosae Island that connected the northern Channel Islands when sea levels were lower near the end of the Last Glacial period. Because the northern Channel Islands have not been connected to the adjacent mainland in recent geological history, the Paleo-Indians who first settled the island clearly had boats and other maritime technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Erlandson, J.M., T.C.

Science 441:1181-1185.&lt;/ref&gt; San Miguel was occupied by the ancestors of today's [[Chumash people]] for many millennia. They had developed a complex and rich maritime culture based on ocean fishing, hunting, and gathering. They called the island Tuquan in the Chumash language. For many centuries, they built and used sophisticated canoes, called [[tomol]]s, made from sewn planks caulked with [[asphaltum]] (bitumen). In tomols, they fished and hunted in island waters and participated in active trade with their neighbors on the other islands and the mainland.

Waldsee is America's oldest and largest immersion program for German language and culture. Over 1,550 young people participate yearly, coming together from all 50 of the United States and many foreign countries. In 2009 Waldsee was recognized as a U.S. National Center of Excellence for its cultural immersion program by the [[American Association of Teachers of German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aatg.org/programs/kinder-lernen-deutsch/189-kld-centers-of-excellence.html|title= New Center of Excellence in 2010|work=AATG KLD Centers of Excellence|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Waldsee was the brainchild of professors Gerald Haukebo and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer at [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, USA]]. In 1961, the first two-week session of "Camp Waldsee" was held for 72 villagers.&lt;ref name="clv history"/&gt; The tuition was $75 and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer served as the dean of the program. Over the next decade, Waldsee began to grow in both the number of villagers attending as well as the number of weeks that the camp ran each summer. Waldsee's first "adventure program," Alpenland, was held at the Rising Wolf Ranch in [[Montana]], where villagers learned German while enjoying [[hiking|hikes]] in the mountains and [[horseback riding]]. 

In 1970, the [[high school]] credit program was launched, providing a four-week intensive instruction for high-school students equivalent to a full year's instruction in a traditional classroom. In 1973, Waldsee launched its first [[study abroad]] program, offering [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] and [[biking]] trips to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. 

In the early 1980s, the permanent Waldsee site began to be built on Turtle River Lake, near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. 

In 2010, Waldsee celebrated its 50th anniversary. Events in 2010 included a major "Waldseefest" on July 24, 2010 and six different alumni weekends.

===World connections===
Waldsee enjoys a continuing [[sister city]] relationship with the German town of [[Bad Waldsee]], located in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. 

[[Horst Köhler]], the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was the official patron (Schirmherr) of Waldsee, as was his predecessor, [[Roman Herzog]]. Many German Ambassadors and other dignitaries have visited Waldsee. World leaders have endorsed Concordia Language Villages, notably former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], whose daughter Chelsea attended Waldsee for six summers.&lt;ref name="clv history"&gt;{{cite web

Waldsee offers one-, two- and four-week living and learning experiences in German language and culture for beginning through advanced 7- to 18-year-olds.

The German Language Village has been cited as a model of innovative education by a wide variety of educators and organizations, including the [[American Association of Teachers of German]] and the [[Goethe Institut]] Inter Nationes. It has also been featured in such media as [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Basler Zeitung]], [[ZDF]] German Television, [[CBS]] American Television, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[German Life Magazine]]'', ''Oskar's'' and ''[[Deutschland (magazine)|Deutschland]]'' magazines, and been the subject of award-winning journalistic essays and various doctoral dissertations. 

===Daily life===
[[Image:Waldsee, Bemidji Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|Waldsee ''Marktplatz.'' The ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen at left, and the ''Bahnhof'' is in the background.]]
Waldsee offers programs that serve youth (7–18 years old), families of all ages, and adults; one of the high school credit programs travels abroad. During the academic year, Waldsee also hosts school groups.

The Waldsee credit program offers traditional instruction as well as credit programs in environmental learning and German (''die Gruene Welle'') and in [[medieval history]] and [[theater]] (''der Maerchenwald''). In the German apprentice program, starting in 2010, participants work half-time in the village stores, in gardening and green roof maintenance, music, the arts and the kitchen and bakery, and also learn half-time in intensive German language groups. 

Waldsee's non-credit programs include programs that focus on producing [[FM radio]] broadcasts at a live [[radio station]], learning about [[Swiss culture]] in tandem with the nearby French village [[Lac du Bois (camp)|Lac du Bois]] and the Italian village [[Lago del Bosco]], learning about the [[Natural environment|environment]], performing [[improvisational theater]] based on medieval lore and legends, and exploring German grammar in depth. 

Villagers can choose different activities every day. Waldsee offers a wide range of European sports from [[soccer]] to [[fencing]]. There is also traditional American [[Summer camp|camp]] activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[canoeing]] at the beach. Waldsee also has a few giant [[chess]] sets and a giant Mühle ([[Nine Men's Morris]]) game.

===Locations ===
Waldsee is currently located at a culturally authentic site on Turtle River Lake north of [[Bemidji]], [[Minnesota]]. Since its founding in 1961, Waldsee has also leased numerous sites across Minnesota. It also offers a credit program that travels abroad.

====Permanent site====
[[Image:WaldseeBemidjiMarktplatzAtDusk.jpg|thumb|left|Waldsee ''Marktplatz'' near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. The culturally authentic ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen in the background.]]
The Waldsee permanent site, which opened in 1982, is located at {{Coord|47|33|33.78|N|94|44|19.36|W|type:landmark_region:US}} near [[Bemidji]], Minnesota on Turtle River Lake, along with six other [[Concordia Language Village]] sites. In all, Waldsee can house up to 240 people (typically, there are about 170 students and 40-50 counselors).

The site is styled after a typical German village and is centered around a ''Marktplatz'', which is the center of most activity at ''Waldsee''. The ''Bahnhof'' is a large building near the entrance of the village that houses class and administrative rooms. The ''Gasthof'' is another building that serves as a dining hall and houses most indoor activities. There is an artists' colony, named ''[[Worpswede]]'', which has about 6 small cabins and houses the arts and crafts activities. 

The first building on the campsite was "''Haus Katja''", which is a log cabin that was built by a group of villagers. The first professionally built building was the ''[[Schwarzwaldhaus]]'' or [[Black Forest house]], which can house 64 people in four units as well as several more in separate sleeping rooms on the first floor. A twin to the ''Schwarzwaldhaus'' is the ''Max Kade Haus'', which was built a few years after the SWH and is very similar in design. 

Two new medium-sized residences have been recently built. The ''Erich Markel Haus'' (Oberammergau and Unterammergau) has room for 24 people in two units. The ''Robert Bosch Haus'' houses the healthcare center (''Heilbronn'') and another residence (''Stuttgart''). The newest building at ''Waldsee'' is the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America. The ''BioHaus'' is an integrated environmental learning center and residence for up to 30 people, including a small apartment upstairs. There is also ''Café Einbeck'', where villagers can sample candy, soft drinks, and other foods from Europe or listen to a jukebox playing German-language music. ''Waldsee'' also has a ''Laden'' at which villagers can make purchases using ''Euro''.

====Leased sites====
Waldsee has also operated at leased sites since its founding in 1961. Waldsee has been located in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]], [[Vergas, Minnesota]], Menagha, Minnesota, Hackensack, Minnesota, and [[Cass Lake, Minnesota]]. Waldsee departed from Vergas in the summer of 2006 to make room for [[Al-Wāḥa]], the [[Arabic]] language village, which was founded that year.

====Abroad====
Waldsee travels abroad to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] with smaller groups of high school students studying German in their summer for credit.


==BioHaus (Passive House)==
In 2006, Waldsee opened the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America, on its permanent site near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the [[Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt]] (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant in North America.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, the BioHaus won the [[Minnesota Environmental Initiative Award]] in the category of Air Quality and Climate Protection. It was a 2007 Nominee for the [[World Clean Energy Award]] in the construction category.&lt;ref name="initiative"&gt;{{cite web

===Cultural importance===
The fixtures are German, and the house helps to introduce students to the "new Germany" as well as preparing them for responsible and ecological citizenship in the global community, the mission of Concordia Language Villages. The modern house itself pays homage to the [[Bauhaus]] school of 1920s architecture, and floor-to-ceiling windows recall the symbolic transparency built into [[West German]] government buildings post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"&gt;{{cite web

===Design===
The house was built using eight critical design strategies: Passive Solar Design, Superinsulation, Advanced Window Technology, Airtightness, Ventilation, Space Heating, Efficient Lighting and Electrical appliances.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The building replaces 100% outside air; no air is recirculated through the system. Two underground tubes exchange outside and inside air eight feet beneath the ground, passively warming or cooling the air to match the temperature of the ground (~55°F year round). The house transfers heat between the outgoing air and the incoming air before it reaches the rooms, resulting in a difference of less than 10°F between the incoming fresh air and the desired room temperature, even in the midst of Minnesotan winter.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

Water in the house is heated by [[solar hot water|solar thermal heat panels]] on the roof, rather than [[photovoltaic]] solar cells, which would convert solar energy directly to electricity.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt;

Low-growing plants make up the building's green roof, reducing rainwater runoff and adding another layer of insulation to the building.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt; Additionally, the western half of the lower level of the structure is tucked into the slope, enabling natural insulation based on the soil.&lt;ref name="initiative"/&gt;
