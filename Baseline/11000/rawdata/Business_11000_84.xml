'''Alanson Harris''' (April 1, 1816 – October 3, 1894) was a sawmill operator and later owner of a farm implement manufacturer in [[Brantford, Ontario]].

Alanson Harris was born in [[Ingersoll, Ontario]] in 1816 to John Harris (native of Mohawk Valley in New York State) and Catherine Jane Dygert.

Alanson Harris began his career as a manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alanson-harris/&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to [[Brantford, Ontario]] in the 1870s he formed A. Harris, Son and Company Limited to manufacture farm implements. Harris plant was located on Market Street South and later moved to Colborne Street.

His son [[John Harris (manufacturer)|John Harris]] was instrumental in growing the nascent company and the firm merged with rival [[Hart Massey]]'s company Massey Manufacturing in 1891&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masseyferguson.us/about_us/mf-history/&lt;/ref&gt; to form '''Massey Harris''', which later became the farm machinery giant [[Massey Ferguson]].

Alanson Harris died in 1894&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alanson-harris/&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.brantford.ca/inventory.nsf/e6a90eb030f9a3d485256cfe006dc8bf/a07fc16fe6566bc785256a8c00717476/$FILE/Cemete~1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Lawren Harris]] and great-grandson [[Lawren P. Harris]] were noted artists.

His daughter is [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Audrey Azoulay]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Essaouira]], in 1941 to a [[Moroccan Jewish]] family, André Azoulay was educated in Paris where he studied economics, journalism and international relations. Previously to his current position as Counsellor to the King of Morocco, Azoulay, had a long career within the [[Paribas]] Bank in Paris (1968 to 1990) where, as Executive Vice-President, he covered the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa Region]] as well as heading the bank’s Public Affairs department.

As Counsellor of the late King Hassan II from (1991 to 1999), and since then of king Mohammed VI, André Azoulay has largely contributed to the implementation of economic reforms, which have been applied throughout the kingdom since their inception in the early 1990s. He also played a significant role in the privatisation and deregulation programs which began in 1993. He emphasized the need for sustaining the role of the private sector and encouraging the international investment to sustain economic growth in Morocco. Azoulay has also largely contributed to promote Morocco throughout the world.

==Peace builder==
Azoulay is also known for his historical input in the follow-up of the peace process in the Middle East and the many initiatives he has been involved in the perspective of deepening the logic of reconciliation between Jews and Muslims. In addition to his professional responsibilities André Azoulay has always fought for peace and dialogue between the Arab Muslim World and that of the Jewish communities in Europe, the United States, Morocco as well as the Arab, [[Berbers|Berber]] and Jewish diasporas worldwide.

For over 40 years, Azoulay has taken an active part in supporting the activities of different movements and associations whose vocation is the [[two-state solution]] (Palestine and Israel) and to help the process of better understanding and mutual respect between Islam and the Western World.

President of the Executive Committee of the Foundation of the Three Cultures and the Three Religions based in Seville (Spain) he is one of the founders of the Aladin Group (Paris) created to promote mutual knowledge and intercultural relations among Muslims and Jews.

In August 2005, Azoulay was also nominated member of the "High Level Group" for the "Alliance of Civilizations, set up by the United Nations. Instigated by Spain and co-sponsored by Turkey, this initiative is addressing the issue of the relations between Islam and the Western world.

In this context, he was elected 5 March 2008 and reelected 9 September 2011 as President of the Euro-Mediterranean Anna Lindh Foundation, and member of the Executive Committee of the Mediterranean Council for Culture (Paris) as well as Board member of the Mediterranean Study and Research Center (Marseille) the Yala online leadership Academy and the Institut de Prospective et d’Etudes pour le Monde Méditerranéen (Paris).

Member of the Board of Al Akhawayne University (Ifrane), the Mediterranean University (Fès) and the High Council of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, Azoulay belongs to the Scientific Committee of "Medinas" a think-tank created by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank to protect, restore and promote the "Medinas" in the Arab World. He is also member of the boards of the Institute Pierre Mendès-France (Paris) and YALA (Young Araba Leaders for Peace).

Belonging to the Board of several economic and financial institutions, André Azoulay is a member of the Royal Academy of Morocco and of the Royal Academy of Spain for Economic and Financial Sciences.  He has been honoured with the titles of "Commandeur dans l’Ordre du Trône" (Morocco) and he has received many awards and titles of honour throughout the world (France, Spain, Italy, Germany, U.K., Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina). André Azoulay received the Lifetime Achievement Award, from the [[American Sephardi Federation]] in New York, where [[Enrico Macias]] and [[David Serero (opera singer)|David Serero]] performed during the ceremony in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2017/03/210421/andre-azoulay-receive-american-sephardi-federations-lifetime-achievement-award/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essaouira==

With his wife Katia, also born in [[Essaouira]], who published 2 books "Essaouira-Mogador : Parfums d’Enfance" and "Essaouira-Mogador : Passion partagée", he is the architect of the renaissance of the city they both hold very dear to their hearts. André Azoulay is fervent in the promotion and revival of his home town which has a specific place in the historical, cultural and spiritual heritage of Morocco. He is the founder President of the Association Essaouira-Mogador which has established since 1992 an original approach to the durable development based on its cultural diversity and spiritual legacy.

Essaouira is justly proud to host seven music festivals a year, ranging from classical to lyrical. They include the renowned [[Gnaoua World Music Festival]], the Chamber Music with "le Printemps Musical des Alizés" and the rich Judeo-Muslim repertoire of Andalusian-Atlantic Festival, a unique event in the world inviting on the same stage, every year, poets, musicians and singers, Muslims and Jews, to keep alive and to perform their common heritage and legacy.

The '''balanced scorecard'''  is a strategy [[performance management]] tool – a semi-standard structured [[report]], that can be used by managers to keep track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey&gt;{{cite web|title=2GC Balanced Scorecard Usage Survey|url=https://2gc.eu/survey|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase 'balanced scorecard' primarily refers to a performance management report used by a management team, and typically this team is focused on managing the implementation of a strategy or operational activities - in a recent survey&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt; 62% of respondents reported using Balanced Scorecard for strategy implementation management, 48% for operational management.  Balanced Scorecard is also used by individuals to track personal performance, but this is less common - only 17% of respondents in the survey using Balanced Scorecard in this way, however it is clear from the same survey that a larger proportion (about 30%) use corporate Balanced Scorecard elements to inform personal goal setting and incentive calculations.

The critical characteristics that define a balanced scorecard are:&lt;ref name=What_is_BSC_FAQ&gt;{{citation|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/faqs/what-is-a-balanced-scorecard|title=FAQ Answer: What is the Balanced Scorecard?|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620093448/http://2gc.eu/files/2GC-FAQ1-What_is_a_Balanced_Scorecard_140616.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* its focus on the strategic agenda of the organization concerned
* the selection of a small number of data items to monitor
* a mix of financial and non-financial data items.

== Use ==
Balanced scorecard is an example of a [[closed-loop controller]] or cybernetic control applied to the management of the [[strategic control|implementation of a strategy]].&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muralidharan|first=Raman|title=A framework for designing strategy content controls|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=590–601|doi=10.1108/17410400410561213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Closed-loop or cybernetic control is where actual performance is measured, the measured value is compared to a reference value and based on the difference between the two corrective interventions are made as required.  Such control requires three things to be effective:
* a choice of data to measure,
* the setting of a reference value for the data,
* the ability to make a corrective intervention.&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004 /&gt;

Within the strategy management context, all three of these characteristic closed-loop control elements need to be derived from the organisation's strategy and also need to reflect the ability of the observer to both monitor performance and subsequently intervene – both of which may be constrained.&lt;ref name=Ouchi_1977&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouchi|first=W.

Two of the ideas that underpin modern balanced scorecard designs concern making it easier to select which data to observe, and ensuring that the choice of data is consistent with the ability of the observer to intervene.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrie|first=Gavin J G|author2=Cobbold, I |title=3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard: Evolution of an effective strategic control tool|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=611–623|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/evolution-of-the-3rd-generation-balanced-scorecard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501201157/http://2gc.eu/files/resources/2GC-WP-Dev3rdGenBSC-090311.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014|accessdate=11 July 2017|doi=10.1108/17410400410561231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Organizations have used systems consisting of a mix of financial and non-financial measures to track progress for quite some time.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Marc|author2=Manzoni, J |title=The balanced scorecard and tableau de bord: Translating strategy into action|journal=Management Accounting|year=1997|volume=79|issue=2|pages=28–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such system was created by Art Schneiderman in 1987 at [[Analog Devices]], a mid-sized semi-conductor company; the Analog Devices Balanced Scorecard.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman/&gt;  Schneiderman's design was similar to what is now recognised as a "First Generation" Balanced Scorecard design.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

In 1990 Art Schneiderman participated in an unrelated research study led by [[Robert S. Kaplan]] in conjunction with US management consultancy Nolan-Norton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nolannorton.com/|title=nolannorton.com|author=|date=|website=www.nolannorton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during this study described his work on performance measurement.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman/&gt;  Subsequently, Kaplan and [[David P. Norton]] included anonymous details of this balanced scorecard design in a 1992 article.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; Kaplan and Norton's article wasn't the only paper on the topic published in early 1992&lt;ref name=Maisel_1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maisel|first=L. S.|title=Performance measurement: the Balanced Scorecard approach|journal=Journal of Cost Management|year=1992|volume=6|issue=2|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 1992 Kaplan and Norton paper was a popular success, and was quickly followed by a second in 1993.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S|author2=Norton, D. P. |title=Putting the Balanced Scorecard to Work|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the two authors published a book ''The Balanced Scorecard''.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S|title=The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action|year=1996|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-0-87584-651-4|author2=Norton, D. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These articles and the first book spread knowledge of the concept of balanced scorecard widely, and has led to Kaplan and Norton being seen as the creators of the concept.

While the "corporate scorecard" terminology was coined by Art Schneiderman, the roots of performance management as an activity run deep in management literature and practice.  Management historians such as [[Alfred D. Chandler Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] suggest the origins of performance management can be seen in the emergence of the complex organisation – most notably during the 19th Century in the USA.&lt;ref name=Chandler_1962&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Alfred D.|title=Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Enterprise|year=1962|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-1-61427-508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent influences may include the pioneering work of General Electric on performance measurement reporting in the 1950s and the work of French process engineers (who created the ''tableau de bord'' – literally, a "dashboard" of performance measures) in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;  The tool also draws strongly on the ideas of the 'resource based view of the firm'&lt;ref name=Penrose_1959&gt;{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Edith|title=The Theory of the Growth of the Firm|year=1959|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-828977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Edith Penrose]].  However it should be noted that none of these influences is explicitly linked to original descriptions of balanced scorecard by Schneiderman, Maisel, or Kaplan &amp; Norton.

Kaplan and Norton's first book&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_1996 /&gt; remains their most popular. The book reflects the earliest incarnations of balanced scorecards – effectively restating the concept as described in the second Harvard Business Review article.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt;  Their second book, ''The Strategy Focused Organization'',&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|title=The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment|date=1 October 2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-57851-250-8|author2=Norton, D. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed work by others (particularly a book published the year before by Olve et al. in Scandinavia&lt;ref name=Olve_1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Olve|first=Nils-Göran|title=Performance Drivers: A practical guide to using the Balanced Scorecard|date=25 Feb 1999|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-98623-2|author2=Roy, J. |author3=Wetter, M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) on the value of visually documenting the links between measures by proposing the "Strategic Linkage Model" or [[strategy map]].

As the title of Kaplan and Norton's second book&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2000 /&gt; highlights, even by 2000 the focus of attention among thought-leaders was moving from the design of Balanced Scorecards themselves, towards the use of Balanced Scorecard as a focal point within a more comprehensive strategic management system.  Subsequent writing on Balanced Scorecard by Kaplan &amp; Norton has focused on uses of Balanced Scorecard rather than its design (e.g. "The Execution Premium" in 2008&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|title=The Execution Premium: Linking Strategy to Operations|date=1 July 2008|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-1-4221-2116-0|author2=Norton, D. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;), however many others have continued to refine the device itself (e.g. Abernethy et al.&lt;ref name=abernethy_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abernethy|first=Margret A|last2=Horne |first2=M. |last3=Lillis |first3=A.M. |last4=Malina |first4=M.A. |last5=Selto |first5=F.H.|title=A multi-method approach to building causal performance maps from expert knowledge|journal=Management accounting research|year=2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=135–155|doi=10.1016/j.mar.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Characteristics ==
The characteristics of the balanced scorecard and its derivatives is the presentation of a mixture of financial and non-financial measures each compared to a 'target' value within a single concise report.  The report is not meant to be a replacement for traditional financial or operational reports but a succinct summary that captures the information most relevant to those reading it.  It is the method by which this 'most relevant' information is determined (i.e., the design processes used to select the content) that most differentiates the various versions of the tool in circulation. The balanced scorecard indirectly also provides a useful insight into an organisation's strategy – by requiring general strategic statements (e.g. mission, vision) to be precipitated into more specific/tangible forms.&lt;ref name=Shulver_Antarkar_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulver|first=Michael J|author2=Antarkar, N |title=The Balanced Scorecard as a Communication Protocol for Managing Across Intra-Organizational Borders|journal=Proceedings from the 12th Annual Conference of the Production and Operations Management Society, Orlando, Florida, USA.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first versions of balanced scorecard asserted that relevance should derive from the [[corporate strategy]], and proposed design methods that focused on choosing measures and targets associated with the main activities required to implement the strategy.  As the initial audience for this were the readers of the [[Harvard Business Review]], the proposal was translated into a form that made sense to a typical reader of that journal – managers of US commercial businesses.  Accordingly, initial designs were encouraged to measure three categories of non-financial measure in addition to financial outputs – those of "customer," "internal business processes" and "learning and growth."  These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Max|title=Improving and evaluating performance with the Public Sector Scorecard|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2017|volume=66|issue=4|pages=442–458|doi=10.1108/IJPPM-06-2015-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt; or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=Butler_1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=A.|author2=Letza S. R. |author3=Neale B. |title=Linking the Balanced Scorecard to Strategy|journal=Long Range Planning|year=1997|volume=30|issue=2|pages=242–253|doi=10.1016/s0024-6301(96)00116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn (2001),&lt;ref name=Ahn_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=H|title=Applying the Balanced Scorecard Concept: An Experience Report|journal=Long Range Planning|year=2001|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–461|doi=10.1016/s0024-6301(01)00057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elefalke (2001),&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elefalke|first=K|title=The Balanced Scorecard of the Swedish Police Service: 7000 officers in total quality management project|journal=Total Quality Management|year=2001|volume=12|issue=7|pages=958–966|doi=10.1080/09544120120096106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brignall (2002),&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brignal|first=S.|title=The UnBalanced Scorecard: a Social and Environmental Critique|journal=Proceedings, Third International Conference on Performance Measurement and Management (PMA2002)|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin (2002),&lt;ref name=Irwin_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=D|title=Strategy Mapping in the Public Sector|journal=International Journal of Strategic Management|year=2002|volume=35|issue=6|pages=563–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radnor et al.

Modern balanced scorecards have evolved since the initial ideas proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the modern performance management tools including Balanced Scorecard are significantly improved – being more flexible (to suit a wider range of organisational types) and more effective (as design methods have evolved to make them easier to design, and use).&lt;ref name=Malina_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malina|first=M. A.|author2=Selto, F. H. |title=Communicating and Controlling Strategy: An Empirical Study of the Effectiveness of the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|year=2001|volume=13|pages=47–90|doi=10.2308/jmar.2001.13.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004 /&gt;

The original thinking behind a balanced scorecard was for it to be focused on information relating to the implementation of a strategy, and over time there has been a blurring of the boundaries between conventional strategic planning and control activities and those required to design a balanced scorecard. This is illustrated well by the four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan &amp; Norton's writing on the subject in the late 1990s:

# Translating the vision into operational goals;
# Communicating the vision and link it to individual performance;
# Business planning; index setting
# Feedback and learning, and adjusting the strategy accordingly.

These steps go far beyond the simple task of identifying a small number of financial and non-financial measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.

Although it helps focus managers' attention on strategic issues and the management of the implementation of strategy, it is important to remember that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt; In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with [[strategic planning]] systems and other tools.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;

=== First Generation ===

The first generation of balanced scorecard designs used a "four perspective" approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy. `The original four "perspectives" proposed&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; were:
* '''Financial''': encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures.  In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question "How do we look to shareholders?" Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity.&lt;ref name=simons_1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Robert L.|title=Levers of Control: How Managers Use Innovative Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal: How Managers Use Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal|date=1 December 1994|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-0-87584-559-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Customer''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What is important to our customers and stakeholders?" Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customers’ purchases, ranking by important customers.
* '''Internal business processes''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What must we excel at?"Examples: cycle time, unit cost, yield, new product introductions.
* '''Learning and growth''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "How can we continue to improve, create value and [[innovation|innovate]]?". Examples: time to develop new generation of products, life cycle to product maturity, time to market versus competition.

The idea was that managers used these perspective headings to prompt the selection of a small number of measures that informed on that aspect of the organisation's strategic performance.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;  The perspective headings show that Kaplan and Norton were thinking about the needs of non-divisional commercial organisations in their initial design.  These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=Butler_1997 /&gt; Ahn (2001),&lt;ref name=Ahn_2001 /&gt; Elefalke (2001),&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001 /&gt; Brignall (2002),&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; Irwin (2002),&lt;ref name=Irwin_2002 /&gt;, Flamholtz (2003)&lt;ref name=Flamholtz_2003 /&gt;, Radnor et al. (2003)&lt;ref name=Radnor_2003 /&gt;).

These suggestions were notably triggered by a recognition that different but equivalent headings would yield alternative sets of measures, and this represents the major design challenge faced with this type of balanced scorecard design: justifying the choice of measures made. "Of all the measures you could have chosen, why did you choose these?"  These issues contribute to dis-satisfaction with early Balanced Scorecard designs, since if users are not confident that the measures within the Balanced Scorecard are well chosen, they will have less confidence in the information it provides.&lt;ref name=Kellermans_2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellermans|first=Walter J.|author2=Floyd F. W. |author3=Veiga S. W. |author4=Matherne C. |title=Strategic Alignment: A missing link in the relationship between strategic consensus and organisational performance|journal=Strategic Organization|year=2013|volume=11|issue=3|pages=304–328 |doi=10.1177/1476127013481155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although less common, these early-style balanced scorecards are still designed and used today.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

In short, first generation balanced scorecards are hard to design in a way that builds confidence that they are well designed. Because of this, many are abandoned soon after completion.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;

=== Second generation ===

In the mid-1990s, an improved design method emerged.&lt;ref name=Olve_1999 /&gt; In the new method, measures are selected based on a set of "strategic objectives" plotted on a "strategic linkage model" or "[[strategy map]]". With this modified approach, the strategic objectives are distributed across the four measurement perspectives, so as to "connect the dots" to form a visual presentation of strategy and measures.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_CMR_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|author2=Norton D. P. |title=Linking the Balanced Scorecard to Strategy|journal=California Management Review|year=1996|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53–79|doi=10.2307/41165876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this modified version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives within each of the perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a "strategic linkage model".  A balanced scorecard of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;   This type of approach provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through.  This style of balanced scorecard has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so can be thought of as representing the "2nd generation" of design approach adopted for the balanced scorecard since its introduction.

=== Third generation ===
{{Main|Third-generation balanced scorecard}}
In the late 1990s, the design approach had evolved yet again. One problem with the "second generation" design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene, to influence strategic goals are, and need to be, anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to "roll forward" and test the impact of these goals necessitated the creation of an additional design instrument: the Vision or Destination Statement. This device was a statement of what "strategic success", or the "strategic end-state", looked like. It was quickly realized that if a Destination Statement was created at the beginning of the design process, then it was easier to select strategic activity and outcome objectives to respond to it. Measures and targets could then be selected to track the achievement of these objectives. Design methods that incorporate a Destination Statement or equivalent (e.g. the [[results-based management]] method proposed by the UN in 2002) represent a tangibly different design approach to those that went before, and have been proposed as representing a "third generation" design method for balanced scorecards.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

Design methods for balanced scorecards continue to evolve and adapt to reflect the deficiencies in the currently used methods, and the particular needs of communities of interest (e.g. NGO's and government departments have found the third generation methods embedded in results-based management more useful than first or second generation design methods).&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrie|first=Gavin J. G.|author2=Kalff D. |author3=Andersen H. |title=Balanced Scorecard and Results- Based Management – Convergent Performance Management Systems|journal=Proceedings of 3rd Annual Conference on Performance Measurement and Management Control, the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management (EIASM), Nice, France|year=2005|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/balanced-scorecard-and-results-based-management-convergent-performance-mana|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation refined the second generation of balanced scorecards to give more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

== Popularity ==
In 1997, Kurtzman&lt;ref name=Kurtzman_1997&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtzman|first=Joel|title=Is your company off course?  Now you can find out why.|newspaper=Fortune|date=17 February 1997|pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 64 percent of the companies questioned were measuring performance from a number of perspectives in a similar way to the balanced scorecard. Balanced scorecards have been implemented by government agencies, military units, business units and corporations as a whole, non-profit organizations, and schools.

Balanced scorecard has been widely adopted, and consistently has been found to be the most popular performance management framework in a widely respected annual survey (e.g. see results from 2003&lt;ref name=Rigby_2003&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby|first=D.|title=Bain and Company's Management Tools and Trends Survey 2003|url=http://www.unstoppablegrowth.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/Public/12065.pdf|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=11 July 2017|author2=Bilodeau B. |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013&lt;ref name=Rigby_2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby|first=D.|title=Bain and Company's Management Tools and Trends Survey 2013|url=http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2013.aspx|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=28 May 2014|author2=Bilodeau B. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407005331/http://bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2013.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Theorists have argued from the earliest days of discussion of Balanced Scorecard usage that much of the benefit of the balanced scorecard comes from the design process itself.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneiderman|first=Arthur M.|title=Why Balanced Scorecards fail|journal=Journal of Strategic Performance Measurement|year=1999|issue=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it is argued that many failures in the early days of balanced scorecard could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt; - it is suggested that by not being involved in the design, the relevant managers who were to use the device did not trust, and so failed to engage with and use the devices.&lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

== Variants ==
Since the balanced scorecard was popularized in the early 1990s, a large number of alternatives to the original 'four box' balanced scorecard promoted by Kaplan and Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; in their various articles and books have emerged.  Most have very limited application, and are typically proposed either by academics as vehicles for expanding the dialogue beyond the financial bottom line – e.g. Brignall (2002)&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; or consultants as an attempt at differentiation to promote sales of books and / or consultancy (e.g. Neely et al. (2002),&lt;ref name=Prism_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Neely|first=Andy|title=The Performance Prism: The Scorecard for Measuring and Managing Business Success: The Scorecard for Measuring and Managing Stakeholder Relationships|date=27 May 2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=London|isbn=978-0-273-65334-9|author2=Adams C. |author3=Kennerley M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne (2002),&lt;ref name=Bourne_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Mike|title=Balanced Scorecard in a Week|date=29 November 2002|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London|isbn=978-0-340-84945-3|author2=Bourne P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven (2002)&lt;ref name=Niven_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Niven|first=Paul R.|title=Balanced Scorecard Step-by-step: Maximizing Performance and Maintaining Results|date=18 April 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-07872-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many of the structural variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt; attempted to identify a pattern in these variations – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared to be part of an evolution of the balanced scorecard concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as "generations".  Broadly, the original 'measures in four boxes' type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;) constitutes the 1st generation balanced scorecard design; balanced scorecard designs that include a 'strategy map' or 'strategic linkage model' (e.g. the Performance Prism,&lt;ref name=Prism_2002 /&gt; later Kaplan &amp; Norton designs&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2008 /&gt; the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy &amp; Wetter (English translation 1999,&lt;ref name=Olve_1999 /&gt; 1st published in Swedish 1997)) constitute the 2nd Generation of Balanced Scorecard design; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a separate document describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the "destination statement" idea) comprise the 3rd generation balanced scorecard design.

Variants that feature adaptations of the structure of balanced scorecard to suit better a particular viewpoint or agenda are numerous. Examples of the focus of such adaptations include the triple bottom line,&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; decision support,&lt;ref name=Ioppolo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioppolo|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Saija|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Salomone|first3=Roberta|title=Developing a Territory Balanced Scorecard approach to manage projects for local development: Two case studies|journal=Land Use Policy|date=July 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=629–640|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837711001190|accessdate=30 June 2014|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; public sector management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Northcott|first1=Deryl|last2=Taulapapa|first2=Tuivaiti Ma'amora|title=sing the balanced scorecard to manage performance in public sector organizations|journal=The International Journal of Public Sector Management|date=2012|volume=25|issue=3|pages=166–191|doi=10.1108/09513551211224234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and health care management.&lt;ref name=Moullin_PSS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moullin|first1=Max|last2=Soady|first2=John|last3=Skinner|first3=John|last4=Price|first4=Charles|last5=Cullen|first5=John|last6=Gilligan|first6=Christine|title=Using the Public Sector Scorecard in Public Health|journal=Journal of Health Care Quality Assurance|date=2007|volume=20|issue=4|pages=281–289|doi=10.1108/09526860710754352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance management elements of the UN's [[Results Based Management]] system have strong design and structural similarities to those used in the 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard design approach.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005 /&gt;

Balanced scorecard is also linked to [[quality management]] tools and activities.&lt;ref name="gardiner_2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardiner|first1=P. D.|last2=Simmons|first2=J. E. L.|title=Performance measurement tools: The balanced scorecard and the EFQM excellence model|journal=Measuring Business Excellence|date=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=14–29|doi=10.1108/13683040310466690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are clear areas of cross-over and association, the two sets of tools are complementary rather than duplicative.&lt;ref name=andersen_lawrie_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Henrik V.|last2=Lawrie|first2=Gavin|last3=Savič|first3=Nenad|title=Effective quality management through third-generation balanced scorecard|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|date=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=634–645|doi=10.1108/17410400410561259|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235283963_Effective_quality_management_through_third-generation_balanced_scorecard|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced scorecard is also used to support the payments of incentives to individuals,&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt; even though it was not designed for this purpose and is not particularly suited to it.&lt;ref name=What_is_BSC_FAQ /&gt;&lt;ref name=2GC_IPM_2003&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I link corporate and individual performance management systems?|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/designing-incentive-systems-linking-people-performance-and-reward|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528144138/http://2gc.eu/files/resources/2GC-WP-LCIPMS-090311.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Academic criticism of the balanced scorecard can be broken into three distinct (but overlapping) areas of concern.

# The first kind of criticism focuses on the empirical nature of the framework, and when it was originally proposed the lack of any formal validation of the ideas. Kaplan and Norton notoriously failed to include any citations of earlier articles in their initial papers on the topic&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt;, an absence noted, for example, by Norreklit&lt;ref name=Norreklit_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norreklit|first=Hanne|title=The balance on the balanced scorecard – a critical analysis of some of its assumptions|journal=Management Accounting Research|year=2000|volume=11|issue=1|pages=65–88|doi=10.1006/mare.1999.0121}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Others identified technical flaws in the methods and design of the original balanced scorecard &lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lingle_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lingle|first=J. H.|author2=Schiemann W. A. |title=From balanced scorecard to strategic gauges: Is measurement worth it?|journal=Management Review|year=1996|volume=85|issue=3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; or concerning the lack of validation for the approach - for example Flamholtz observed that no validation was provided for the choice of the "four perspectives" of the 1st Generation design&lt;ref name=Flamholtz_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flamholtz|first=Erik|title=Putting Balance and Validity into the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Journal of Human Resource Costing and Accounting|year=2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=15-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
# The second kind of criticism is that the balanced scorecard does not provide a bottom line score or a unified view with clear recommendations: it is simply a list of metrics (e.g. Jensen 2001&lt;ref name=Jensen_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=M. C.|title=Value maximisation, stakeholder theory, and the corporate objective function|journal=European Financial Management|year=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=297–318|doi=10.1111/1468-036x.00158}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  These critics usually include in their criticism suggestions about how the 'unanswered' question postulated could be answered, but typically the unanswered question relate to things outside the scope of balanced scorecard itself (such as developing strategies) (e.g. Brignall&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt;)
# The third kind of criticism is that the model fails to fully reflect the needs of stakeholders – putting bias on financial stakeholders over others.  Early forms of Balanced Scorecard proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt; focused on the needs of commercial organisations in the USA – where this focus on investment return was appropriate.  This focus was maintained through subsequent revisions.&lt;ref name=Adams_2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=C.|title=Performance measurement frameworks: a review|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK.|author2=Neely A. |author3=Kennerley M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now over 20 years after they were first proposed, the four most common perspectives in Balanced Scorecard designs mirror the four proposed in the original Kaplan &amp; Norton paper.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;  However, as noted earlier in this article, there have been many studies that suggest other perspectives might better reflect the priorities of organisations – particularly but not exclusively relating to the needs of organisations in the public and Non Governmental sectors.&lt;ref name=Andersen_Lawrie_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Henrik V.|last2=Lawrie|first2=Gavin|title=Examining Opportunities for Improving Public Sector Governance Through Better Strategic Management|journal=Proceedings, Third International Conference on Performance Measurement and Management (PMA 2002),|date=2002|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237340660_Examining_Opportunities_for_Improving_Public_Sector_Governance_Through_Better_Strategic_Management|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the balanced scorecard does not address important aspects of nonprofit strategy such as social dimensions, human resource elements, political issues and the distinctive nature of competition and collaboration in nonprofit settings.&lt;ref name=Kong_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=E.|title=Analysing BSC and IC's usefulness in non-profit organisations.|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=284–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; More modern design approaches such as [[third generation balanced scorecard|3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard]], the Public Sector Scorecard&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; and the UN's [[Results Based Management]] methods explicitly consider the interests of wider stakeholder groups, and perhaps address this issue in its entirety.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005 /&gt;

In response to these concerns there have been many studies seeking to provide (retrospective) academic underpinnings for the Balanced Scorecard concept&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt;, and to provide case study and validation information for the various design generations&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radnor_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrie_et_al_2016 /&gt;.  There are relatively few reliable assessments of the effectiveness of the approaches embodied in Balanced Scorecard, but some studies demonstrate a link between the use of balanced scorecards and better decision making or improved financial performance of companies&lt;ref name=Ittner_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ittner|first1=C.D.|last2=Larcker|first2=D.F.|last3=Randall|first3=T.|title=Performance implications of strategic performance measurement in financial services firms|journal=Accounting Organizations and Society|date=2003|volume=28|issue=7|pages=715–741}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Broadcast surveys of usage have difficulties in this respect, due to the wide variations in definition of 'what a balanced scorecard is' noted above (making it hard to work out in a survey if you are comparing like with like).&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;  Single organization case studies suffer from the 'lack of a control' issue common to any study of organizational change – what the organization would have achieved if the change had not been made isn't known, so it is difficult to attribute changes observed over time to a single intervention (such as introducing a balanced scorecard).  However, such studies as have been done have typically found balanced scorecard to be useful.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;

Consideration has been given to the effect of organisation size on Balanced Scorecard effectiveness:  
* For large organisations this work has focused on how to translate aggregate corporate strategies into performance management tools relevant to individual teams / units within the organisation.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_et_al_2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Gavin V.|last2=Abdullah|first2=N.A.|last3=Bragg|first3=Christopher|last4=Varlet|first4=Guillaume|title=Multi-level strategic alignment within a complex organisation|journal=Journal of Modelling in Management|date=2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=889–910|doi=10.1108/JM2-11-2014-0085|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309818479_Multi-level_strategic_alignment_within_a_complex_organisation|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In SMEs Balanced Scorecard has been found to be effective, but it has been noted that focus is required on balancing design complexity and relevance with the availability of resource to do the design work.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Andersen_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Andersen|first2=Henrik V.|last1=Lawrie|first1=Gavin|title=Balanced Scorecard implementation in SMEs: reflection in literature and practice|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth SMESME Conference|date=2006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252637217_Balanced_Scorecard_implementation_in_SMEs_reflection_in_literature_and_practice|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have argued that the Balanced Scorecard is unsuitable for SMEs for a variety of reasons, including the belief that SMEs lack a long-term strategic focus (Hvolby and Thorstenson (2000), McAdam (2000)), that changes in an SME’s strategy are too frequent,&lt;ref name=rompho_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rompho|first1=N.|title=Why the Balanced Scorecard Fails in SMEs: A Case Study.|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|date=2011|volume=6|issue=11|pages=39–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that SMEs have limited knowledge about performance measurement in general (Rantanen and Holtari 2000) and therefore do not recognise the benefits that might accrue from use of the tool (McAdam 2000; Bourne 2001), but it is also important to note that none of these studies attempts to theorise the reasons behind their negative findings.

== Software tools ==

It is important to recognize that the balanced scorecard by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and non-financial topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).&lt;ref name=Adams_2007 /&gt;

The processes of collecting, reporting, and distributing balanced scorecard information can be labor-intensive and prone to procedural problems (for example, getting all relevant people to return the information required by the required date).  The simplest mechanism to use is to delegate these activities to an individual, and many Balanced Scorecards are reported via ad-hoc methods based around email, phone calls and office software.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

In more complex organizations, where there are multiple balanced scorecards to report and/or a need for co-ordination of results between balanced scorecards (for example, if one level of reports relies on information collected and reported at a lower level) the use of individual reporters is problematic.  Where these conditions apply, organizations use balanced scorecard reporting software to automate the production and distribution of these reports.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

Recent surveys have consistently found that roughly one third of organizations use generic office software to report their balanced scorecard, one third used software developed specifically for their own use, and one third used one of the many commercial packages available.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;&lt;ref name=intrafocus_surveys&gt;{{cite web|title=Balanced Scorecard Surveys (2012–2016)|url=https://www.intrafocus.com/services/balanced-scorecard-survey|publisher=Intrafocus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Direktorium LDE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A meeting of a board of directors of the [[Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company]] in 1852]]
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013 }}

A '''board of directors''' is a recognized group of people who jointly oversee the activities of an [[organization]], which can be either a for-profit [[business]], [[nonprofit organization]], or a [[government agency]]. Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.

In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s and the board is the highest [[authority]] in the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}} its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Other names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''. It may also be called "the executive board" and is often simply referred to as "the board".{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

==Roles==
{{Business administration}}
Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and setting out strategic objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]] (of which the titles vary from organization to organization; the chief executive may be titled [[chief executive officer]], [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[executive director]]);
* terminating the chief executive;
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s for the organization's performance;
* setting the salaries, compensation and benefits of senior management;

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and between  jurisdictions. For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.

Typically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the "chair" or "chairperson"), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}

==Directors==
The directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director "inside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director "executive director"]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director "outside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director "nonexecutive director"]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside director===
An inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.&lt;ref name=Ivestopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside director===
{{Main|Independent director}}

An outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.&lt;ref name="Investopedia 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that only serves a domestic market, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate "insider dealing" between insider directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.

===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===
*'''Director''' – a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.
*'''Inside director''' – a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization
*'''[[Outside director]]''' – a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization
*'''Executive director''' – an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''[[Non-executive director]]''' – an inside director who is not an executive with the organization
*'''Shadow or ''de facto'' director''' – an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization
* '''Nominee director''' – an individual who is appointed by a shareholder, creditor or interest group (whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting) and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointor/s or other interest in the appointing company

Individual directors often serve on more than one board.&lt;ref name=Businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Process and structure==
[[File:Tetley Board Room 31 August 2018 1.jpg|thumb|right|The board room of [[Tetley's Brewery]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school Board Process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142343/http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization in the USA are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Consulting and The Board Group.

===Board meetings===
[[File:Board room at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.jpg|thumb|Typical board room setting]]

=== Size ===
Historically, nonprofit boards have not uncommonly had large boards with up to twenty-four members, but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/NWK6-E3CC|title=For Nonprofit Boards, Smaller is Better|last=White|first=Cyrus|date=|website=perma.cc|publisher=The South Cabin Group LLC|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that after seven people, each additional person reduces the effectiveness of [[group decision-making]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Non-corporate boards==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Membership organizations===
In [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]].{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481–483}} The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

The setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the "shareholders" are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold. These ex-officio members have all the same rights as the other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the board may be removed before their term is complete. Details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not contain such details, the section on disciplinary procedures in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In a [[public company|publicly held company]], directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the company—the [[shareholder]]s/stockholders.   In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].

===Governance===
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.&lt;ref name=CRI&gt;[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref name=CRI/&gt;

A contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-tier system===
In some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).

{{Globalise/UK | section|date=April 2016}}

The development of a separate board of directors to manage/govern/oversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that "the directors and the directors alone shall manage."&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;
See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election and removal ===

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Although in 2002 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASDAQ]] required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y. (2007). [http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf Corporate governance and firm value: The impact of the 2002 governance rules] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611072244/http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf |date = 11 June 2010 }}. ''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more "gray outsider directors" (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D. (1999). [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis]. ''Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so "with cause"; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A – a meeting must be held.}} The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985.}} Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous "[[golden parachute]]" which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cai|first=Jay|author2=Garner, Jacqueline |author3=Walkling, Ralph |title = Shareholder Access to the Boardroom: A Survey of Recent Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=15–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sometimes imposes a ban (a "D&amp;O bar") on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases, and one of these was upheld in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/442382/sec-wins-d-o-bar-against-alleged-hedge-fund-scammer SEC Wins D&amp;O Bar Against Alleged Hedge Fund Scammer]. Law360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise of powers===
The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

===Duties===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder," ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Proper purpose" ====
Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}

==== "Unfettered discretion" ====
Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===="Conflict of duty and interest"====

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

=====Transactions with the company=====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..." (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}

===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B – the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:

: "(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

===== Competing with the company =====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

==== Common law duties of care and skill ====
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

: "a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

: "such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Remedies for breach of duty ====
In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

====Current trends====
Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to "soften" the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole" and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company's employees
* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see, for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Board and Society====

Most companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board &lt;ref&gt;Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board], London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society.These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification. 

Social Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed.They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.

===United States===

====Sarbanes–Oxley Act====

The [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is a "financial expert."

The law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) to have a majority of independent directors—directors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it.

====Size====
According to the Corporate Library's study, the average size of publicly traded company's board is 9.2 members, and most boards range from 3 to 31 members. According to Investopedia, some analysts think the ideal size is seven.&lt;ref name=BoD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp#ixzz27Kekd83e |title=Evaluating The Board Of Directors|publisher= investopedia.com|date= 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State law may specify a minimum number of directors, maximum number of directors, and qualifications for directors (e.g. whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities).&lt;ref name=BoD2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/corporate-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Corporate Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoD3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/nonprofit-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Nonprofit Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees====
While a board may have several committees, two—the compensation committee and audit committee—are critical and must be made up of at least three [[independent director]]s and no inside directors. Other common committees in boards are nominating and governance.&lt;ref name=BoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf Compensation Committee Structure, Function and Best Practices] Richard E. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compensation====
Directors of [[Fortune 500]] companies received median pay of $234,000 in 2011. Directorship is a part-time job. A recent National Association of Corporate Directors study found directors averaging just 4.3 hours a week on board work.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/story/2011-10-25/director-compensation-rising/50918332/1 | work=USA Today | title=Company directors see pay skyrocket | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys indicate that about 20% of [[nonprofit foundation]]s pay their board members,&lt;ref name="Schambra"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schambra | first=William A. | title=Board Compensation: To Pay or Not to Pay? | work=Philanthropy magazine |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable | url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/compensating_foundation_directors1 | accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2% of American [[nonprofit organization]]s do.{{sfn|BoardSource|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite |author=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |date=4 February 2008 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |quote=Charities should generally not compensate persons for service on the board of directors except to reimburse direct expenses of such service. ...

===Criticism===
According to John Gillespie, a former investment banker and co-author of a book critical of boards,&lt;ref&gt;''Money for Nothing: How the Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions''&lt;/ref&gt; "Far too much of their time has been for check-the-box and cover-your-behind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders".&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; At the same time, scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousseau|first1=Peter|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|title=Director Histories and the Pattern of Acquisitions|journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=671–698|doi=10.1017/s0022109015000289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-border investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroup|first=Caleb|title=International Deal Experience and Cross-Border Acquisitions|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|pages=73–97|date=November 28, 2015|ssrn=2037512|doi=10.1111/ecin.12365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]] has been the subject of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and [[comply or explain]] systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senden|first1=Linda|title=The Multiplicity of Regulatory Responses to Remedy the Gender Imbalance on Company Boards|journal=Utrecht Law Review|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=5|pages=51–66|doi=10.18352/ulr.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, upper-middle classes tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">The '''British Arrows''' (formerly the '''British Television Advertising Awards (BTAA)''') is an advertising awards body in London, which honours the best moving image advertising in the UK. 

Founded in 1976, the AWARDS show, held in March, awarded advertising agencies and production companies across a number of categories. Special awards including Advertising Agency of the Year, Production Company of the Year and Commercial of the Year were also awarded. In 1996 the CRAFT AWARDS, held in November, were founded, honouring the best craftspeople in advertising and awarded individuals across a number of categories, including Director, Editing and Casting. Special awards including Best Crafted Commercial of the Year were also awarded. For each show a Chair of the Jury is selected by the Board of Directors. The Chair then curates their own Jury from a range of disciplines who watch and discuss all commercials entered at a private cinema in Soho before voting. 

In 2017, after 40 years of AWARDS and 20 years of CRAFT, the two shows were combined to create The British Arrows 2017, held in May at Battersea Evolution.

'''&lt;u&gt;BOARD OF DIRECTORS&lt;/u&gt;''' 

The British Arrows is overseen by a Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board is Charlie Crompton, [[Rogue Films]]. 

The current list of Board of Directors are Alice Tonge, Andy Gulliman, Ben Priest, Chris Bovill &amp; John Allison, Chris O'Reilly, Clare Donald, Dave Monk, Davud Karbassioun, Francine Linsey, Jane Bolton, KJ Weir, Lee Pavey, Lindsey Clay, Lizie Gower, Mark Benson, Orlando Wood, Robin Shenfield, Sally Campbell and Tony Davidson.

'''&lt;u&gt;GLOBAL TOUR&lt;/u&gt;''' 

The [[Walker Art Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Greta Cunningham]] |coauthors= |title=Awards honor offbeat TV ads |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2003/12/05_cunninghamg_brit/ |quote=For the 27th year, the Walker Art Center will present the British Television Advertising Awards. The screenings draw more than 10,000 Minnesotans each year and are almost always sold out. Audiences get to see the best of British advertising, from campaigns featuring a male streaker to avant-garde ads for hot noodles and automobiles. The annual event showcases a collision of art and commerce. MPR's Greta Cunningham talked with [[Peter Bigg]], the administrator for the awards, who says this year's selections come in a variety of themes. |work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] |date=December 5, 2003 |accessdate=2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began screening the British Television Advertising Awards in 1986, when the program was part of a tour that was facilitated by the BTAA and the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art.  Walker had a strong interest in advertising and design and had been screening the Clio Awards for many years, so there was a natural curiosity about foreign commercials. Major companies such as Target, Best Buy and General Mills are based in the Twin Cities and bring creative teams over to screenings, as do other advertising agencies like Fallon.  Watching the awards in a cinematic setting provides a unique communal screening experience that has broadened the program to a general audience of Anglophiles, film students, and the press who attend annually.

In December each year, over 27,000 people attend over 88 screenings of the latest British Arrows Awards showreel at Walker each year.  It’s a much-loved program in the Twin Cities with many people attending year after year.  The audiences are moved by the program, which can be a unique cross cultural experience, as they try to figure out brands and products that are not available in the U.S., but are cleverly conveyed.  It’s a unique experience for American audiences to view ads that are not invested in the hard sell; rather, gaining interest in products and services through humor, pathos and a dynamic cinematography. Each year a member of the British Arrows board attends the presentation, introduces the program on the opening night and handles interviews on TV, radio and the press.

Alongside the Walker Art Center the British Arrows Awards has also been screened at the Cincinnati World Cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cincyworldcinema.org/x_161014baa.php|title=CWC :: British Arrows 2016|website=www.cincyworldcinema.org|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Cleveland Cinematheque]], [[Hong Kong Arts Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkac.org.hk/en/calendar.php?id=1837|title=Hong Kong Arts Centre calendar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Memphis Brooks Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.overtonpark.org/events/british-arrows-awards-at-brooks-museum|title=British Arrows Awards at Brooks Museum {{!}} Overton Park|website=www.overtonpark.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Milwaukee Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/09/29/milwaukee-film-festival-british-arrows-awards/|title=Milwaukee Film Festival: British Arrows Awards|last=Jannene|first=Jeramey|website=Urban Milwaukee|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts Houston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/event/british-arrows-2015-7993021|title=British Arrows 2015|website=Houston Press|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Northwest Film Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nwfilm.org/films/2015-british-arrows-awards/|title=2015 British Arrows Awards {{!}} NW Film Center|date=2016-04-26|work=NW Film Center|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Smith San Rafael Film Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfstation.com/2014-british-arrows-award-e2247861|title=2014 British Arrows Award|website=www.sfstation.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, The Institute of Contemporary Art Boston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icaboston.org/events/2016-british-arrows|title=2016 British Arrows {{!}} icaboston.org|website=www.icaboston.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Wisconsin Film Festival]] and [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ybca.org/whats-on/british-arrows-awards-2016|title=YBCA: British Arrows Awards 2016|website=www.ybca.org|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13927">A '''changes clause''', in [[government contracting]], is a required clause in United States government construction contracts.{{definition needed|date=December 2017}}

==Background==
Cardinal Changes (Significant Changes) clauses are the source of a significant number of disputes arising from government contracts. The clause, which has appeared in nearly every U.S. government contract for over 100 years, gives the government the power unilaterally to order contractual modifications.&lt;ref&gt;4-15 Construction Law P 15.03&lt;/ref&gt;  If the parties are unable to agree on compensation to be received by the contractor for the modified work, the contractor shall be entitled to an [[equitable adjustment]]. ''''''The goal of an equitable adjustment is to place the contractor in the position he would have been in had the change not been encountered''''''. The adjustment should not alter the contractor's profit or loss position from what it was before the change occurred.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Shea Co. v. United States, 10 Cl. Ct. 620 (1986). Where a contract was bid in a lump sum, the equitable adjustment for substitution of work is computed by the following formula: (1) Adjusted contract price; (2) Less projected cost without changed conditions; (3) Plus actual cost under changed conditions; (4) Plus reasonable profit/overhead computed in accordance with governing regulations on difference between 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Changes clause was first used in defense contracts where it was taken to be essential in time of war for the government to include new technologies without halting work to renegotiate the contract. Changes clauses are in almost all categories of government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Vom Baur, The Origin of the Changes Clause in Naval Procurement,  8 Pub. Cont. L.J. 175 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Changes Clause is not incorporated in writing it is incorporated implicitly under the [[G.L. Christian and associates v. US|Christian Doctrine]] in almost&lt;ref&gt;See 4 No. 2 Nash &amp; Cibinic Rep. ¶ 13 ("In Aero Corp., ASBCA 8178, 1963 BCA ¶3665, the board refused to use the doctrine to insert the Changes clause in a purchase order.  In Jamsar, Inc., GSBCA 4396, 76-2 BCA ¶12053, the board refused to insert the Changes clause in a building services contract. Under the FAR, the Changes clause is a mandatory clause for almost all types of contracts.")&lt;/ref&gt; all U.S. government contracts, including FAR Part 12 contracts.

==Changes clauses for construction contracts in the Federal Acquisition Regulations==
There are three Changes clauses for construction contracts contained in the [[Federal Acquisition Regulations]]. One applies to fixed-price contracts, another to cost reimbursement contracts, and the third to time and materials or labor hours.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. § 52.243-1 (Fixed Price), 52.243-2 (Cost Reimbursement), 52.243-3 (Time and Materials).&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of these clauses give the government the right, at any time and without notice to the [[sureties]], to make changes in the work within the general scope of the contract. The clause for fixed-price contracts specifies that changes may be made to the specifications (including drawings and designs), the method or manner of performance, government-furnished facilities, equipment, materials, services, or site, or acceleration of the work. The clause for cost reimbursement contracts specifies that changes may be made to the "plans and specifications or instructions incorporated in the contract."

==Purposes==

The Changes clause accommodate several purposes. Either party may want to incorporate a technological advance. The Changes clause allows the contractor to propose changes to the work. This can result in more efficient contract performance. The Changes clause permits the government to ask for something new without the overhead of conducting a new [[procurement]].

The limitation of the government's right to make changes to those changes deemed to be "within the general scope of the contract" was for many years of great procedural significance in government contract litigation because, prior to the [[Contract Disputes Act of 1978]], a claim arising from such a change could not be brought to the various boards of contract appeals.&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because claims involving changes outside the general scope of the contract, sometimes called cardinal changes, were deemed to be breach of contract cases and had to be taken to the Court of Claims. The distinction between cardinal and other changes is no longer jurisdictionally significant because the Contract Disputes Act gives boards of contract appeals concurrent jurisdiction with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (formerly named the U.S. Claims Court&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to the [[Court of Federal Claims Technical and Procedural Improvements Act]] of 1992, the name of the United States Claims Court was changed to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Pub. L. No. 102-572, § 902, 106 Stat. 4516 (effective Oct. 29, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;) over breach of contract cases.&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. §§ 607(d), 609(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a change is a cardinal change may, however, still be relevant to whether the contractor can unilaterally stop work pending resolution of a dispute,&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States, 442 F.2d 364, 194 Ct. Cl. 799 (1971) ;  Gregory Lumber Co. v. United States, 9 Cl. Ct. 503, 518 (1986) ;  Gevyn Constr. Corp. v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. 203 , aff'd, 827 F.2d 752 (Fed. Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and the measure of damages that may be recovered.

As a quid pro quo for the government's unilateral right to order changes, the Changes clause gives the contractor a right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. § 52.243-4(d).&lt;/ref&gt; If the parties are able to agree on the amount of the cost adjustment, they can execute a contract modification. If they are unable to agree, the contractor is entitled to an equitable adjustment in accordance with the cost principles contained in Part 31 of the FAR.&lt;ref&gt;See  C.B.C. Enters., Inc. v. United States, 24 Cl. Ct. 187 (1991) , aff'd, 978 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (contractor cannot use the Eichleay formula when the government orders additional work and extends the performance period; home office overhead costs are covered by the mark-up on the direct cost of the extra work);  Appeal of A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., ENG BCA No. 5103, 91-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 24,149 (1991) (subcontractor entitled to adjustment for extended home office overhead under Eichleay because it incurred delays caused by government-requested changes). See also  Satellite Elec. Co. v. Dalton, 105 F.3d 1418 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (evidence of a contractor's ability to take on other work during government-caused delay barred Eichleay damages). Note that the government was not required to prove that the contractor actually took on work during the suspension period, or to prove by a preponderance of the evidence his ability to do so. Cf. Appeal of Interstate Gen. Govt. Contractors v. West, 12 F.3d 1053, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (timely completion precludes recovery of unabsorbed overhead even where the government caused a suspension of performance, because the anticipated time of performance was not actually extended by the suspension).  Aircraft Gear Corp. v. Kaman Aero Corp., 875 F. Supp. 485, 496 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (damages must be unavoidable if the Eichleay formula is to employed).

In the case Togo D. West Jr. v. All State Boiler, Inc., 146 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified the test for resolving unabsorbed overhead claims. All State distinguished Satellite, above, which many practitioners believed had ended Eichleay's vitality. Under All State, to avoid Eichleay, the government must show not only that a contractor sought additional work during a suspension and that the additional work was not part of the contractor's planned/normal stream of work, but was intended to replace the government-delayed project. In shifting the burden of proof, All State may have effectively overruled Satellite. See also Am. Renovation and Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, 45 Fed. Cl. 44 (1999) (for a contractor to recover unabsorbed overhead, it must demonstrate that the government put the contractor on standby, required it to resume work at a moment's notice, and consequently precluded the contractor from taking on other work).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost reimbursement vs. fixed cost contracts==
The nature of the Changes clause for cost reimbursement contracts is somewhat different from that for fixed-price contracts because in the case of a cost reimbursement contract the contractor is already entitled to reimbursement for all of its reasonable costs and only needs an adjustment in the target price or the amount of its fee. The clause provides for such an adjustment to be made in the estimated cost, delivery or completion schedule, and the amount of any fixed fee.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. § 52.243-2(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of basic rules regarding the Changes clause that have been developed by the courts and boards of contract appeals over the years. One of the fundamental tenets is that a contractor cannot claim an equitable adjustment where it incurs additional costs or performance delays voluntarily, rather than as a result of government action.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,  Appeal of R-E, Inc., ASBCA No. 20891, 77-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 12,670 (1977). In R-E, Inc., the contractor was to build a foundation for a utility pole installation in accordance with plans and specifications furnished by the government and had no obligation to pass upon the adequacy of such a foundation to accomplish the purpose in view. The contractor, nonetheless, insisted on installation of a more expensive foundation, allegedly on the basis that the government's foundation was not adequate. Held, that this was a design specification and not a performance specification; and that by prescribing the character and dimensions of the foundation, the government implicitly warranted that if the design was followed, the foundation would be adequate. Thus, the use of a steel-reinforced foundation, exceeding both the government's specifications and trade practice, did not entitle the contractor to additional compensation for the extra cost thus incurred.

See also  Calfon Constr., Inc. v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 426 (1989) , aff'd, 923 F.2d 872 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (listing elements to establish a constructive change);  Appeal of Essential Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 18706, 89-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 21,632 (1989) (the board rejected contractor's claim because there was no support for the proposition that the government caused the delays);  Appeal of Berkeley Constr. Co., PSBCA No. 1153, 85-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 18,254 (1985);  Appeal of Accent General, ASBCA No. 29796, 86-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 19,237 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Another tenet is that a contractor cannot prevail on its claim for equitable adjustment unless it shows that its interpretation of the contract is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States, 843 F.2d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ;  P.J. Maffei Bldg. Wrecking Corp. v. United States, 732 F.2d 913 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ; Appeal of Moulder Bros., ASBCA Nos. 33389, 33714,  89-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 21,639 (1989); Appeal of Santa Fe Eng'rs, Inc., ASBCA No. 32448, 89-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 22,024 (1989). See also  T.L. James &amp; Co., Inc. v. Traylor Bros., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4378 (E.D. La. Mar. 23, 2000) (noting that the contractor must show that it reasonably relied upon its interpretation of the contract and that it incurred damage as a result of the material difference between the expected and actual conditions);  Johnny F. Smith Truck and Dragline Serv. v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 443 (2001) (if there is a conflict between the contractor's view of the government's obligations and the actual language of the contract provisions, this should trigger the contractor's duty to inquire; the contractor cannot protest the term unless the contractor inquired or sought clarification of the contract's language).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the government is responsible only for changes ordered, approved, or adopted by the contracting officer or an authorized representative of the contracting officer.

==Causation==
To recover for a change, the contractor must show that the change caused the increased costs or delays for which it is seeking compensation.&lt;ref&gt;See  Massman Constr. Co. v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 769 F.2d 1114 (6th Cir. 1985) ;  Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 956 (Ct. Cl. 1965) ;  Appeal of Batteast Constr. Co., Inc., ASBCA No. 35818, 92-1 B.C.A. (CCH) P 24,697 (1991) (based on on-site observations by project superintendent, the board ruled that the contractor was entitled to an adjustment for lost labor productivity attributable to government directed change); Appeal of Frontier Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 33658, 89-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 21,595 (1989) (the board held that where the delay is the result of government fault, as with defective specifications, all of the delay is per se unreasonable).&lt;/ref&gt; A contractor ordinarily will not be entitled to recover for a constructive change in the work required by the government where the government's actions were not the direct cause of the contractor's increased costs. An example of such a situation is where government-furnished property is not at the work site on schedule, but does not cause any delay to the contractor because, for other reasons, the contractor was not ready to proceed with the installation of that property. Where, however, a contractor and the government are both responsible, through their unreasonable acts, for failure to discover a differing site condition, the costs of the delay have been ordered shared.&lt;ref&gt;T. Brown Constructors, Inc. v. Federico Pena, 132 F.3d 724 (Fed. Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8553">The '''chief privacy officer''' (CPO) is a senior level executive within a United States-based business or organization. "Consumer concerns over the use of personal information, including medical data and financial information along with laws and regulations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy Officer {{!}} DefineFinance|url = http://www.definefinance.com/chief-privacy-officer|website = www.definefinance.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the key reasons that the CPO role exists, as this was introduced to help keep personal information safe.

There is legislation in different sectors concerning the use of personal information. For example, in medical industry, the protection of patient medical records (e.g. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or [[HIPAA]]). Another example is in the finance sector with the safeguarding of consumer financial and banking transactions (e.g. The [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] and its Disposal Rule, and the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] and its Safeguards Rule and Financial Privacy Rule).

== History ==
In the United States, the position of chief information officer was first established at Acxiom Corporation in 1991 with the appointment of Jennifer Barrett as CPO,&lt;ref&gt;https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlPjEAAV/&lt;/ref&gt; with the second appointment of CPO at the Internet advertising firm [[AllAdvantage]] in August 1999, when it appointed privacy lawyer [[Ray Everett-Church]] to the newly created position, starting a trend that quickly spread among major corporations, both offline and online. The role of the Chief Privacy Officer was solidified within the U.S. corporate world in November 2000 with the naming of Harriet Pearson as Chief Privacy Officer for [[IBM|IBM Corporation]]. That event prompted one influential analyst to declare, "the chief privacy officer is a trend whose time has come." &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/IBM+appoints+chief+privacy+officer/2100-1001_3-249135.html news.com IBM appoints chief privacy officer]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, the non-profit research organization Privacy and American Business reported that a significant number of [[Fortune 500]] firms had appointed senior executives with the title or role of Chief Privacy Officer. The growth of the Chief Privacy Officer trend was further fueled by the European Union's passage in the late 1990s of [[information privacy|data privacy]] laws and regulations that included a requirement for all corporations to have an individual designated to be accountable for privacy compliance.

By 2002, the position of Chief Privacy Officer and similar privacy-related management positions were sufficiently widespread to support the creation of professional societies and trade associations to promote training and certification programs. In 2002 the largest of these organizations, the Privacy Officers Association and the Association of Corporate Privacy Officers, merged to form the International Association of Privacy Officers, which was later renamed the [[International Association of Privacy Professionals]] (IAPP). The IAPP holds several conferences and training seminars each year around the world, hosting association members from major global corporations and government agencies, with executives seeking certification programs in privacy management practices.

== Responsibilities &amp; Duties ==

Some of the key responsibilities that a CPO has to have are: being able to use business strategies and procedures and apply it to the business, being able to organize plans and lastly looking at privacy program reviews by checking and analyzing the information to ensure it is correct. They are also responsible for making sure data is secure from unauthorized users and making. They would also have to help to improve systems for auditing and monitoring, to therefore resolve any privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Current Openings|url = http://www.merkleinc.com/careers/current-openings?gnk=job&amp;gni=8a7880ec5088917c015090c5ff850d3a&amp;gns=Indeed&amp;source=indeed.com#.Vjj9xWvS7Tg|website = Merkle|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a CPO is responsible for all the privacy of the data in an organization, one major part of their job is to avoid [[Data breach|data breaches]], especially if the organization is a large corporation. However some major companies have been hacked and have data breaches.

These include:
*[[eBay]] -  up to 145 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful"&gt;{{Cite web|title = World’s Biggest Data Breaches &amp; Hacks {{!}} Information is Beautiful|url = http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/|website = www.informationisbeautiful.net|accessdate = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Target Corporation|Target]] -  up to 70 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[Home Depot]] - up to 56 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[Anthem (company)|Anthem]] - up to 80 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan Chase]] - up to 76 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;

Data breaches are commonly high-profile events and not only the reputation of the CPO will be affected but also the company's reputation, impacting consumer confidence.

== Qualities  ==
One key quality a CPO will need to have is being good at communicating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 7 habits of highly effective CPOs - Supply Business|url = http://www.supplybusiness.com/previous-articles/winter-2009-2010/features/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-cpos/|website = www.supplybusiness.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; because poor communication could lead to a leakage of data which the CPO would be accountable for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Government Chief Privacy Officer {{!}} ICT.govt.nz|url = https://www.ict.govt.nz/governance-and-leadership/the-gcio-team/government-chief-privacy-officer/|website = www.ict.govt.nz|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another quality a CPO should have is staying aware of any new developments and risks in the field.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
There are some major benefits to having a CPO in your organization. The first would be that they help to keep data secure, so this ensures that security of data is not compromised.  Another benefit is that they help develop policies which is why "''30% of CPOs are attorneys''" and "''15% are in the information security department''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why your company needs a chief privacy officer|url = http://www.networkworld.com/article/2290212/lan-wan/why-your-company-needs-a-chief-privacy-officer.html|website = Network World|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this means that CPO can legally help to ensure that the data stays secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy Officer|url = https://hbr.org/2000/11/chief-privacy-officer|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of what industries a CPO can be beneficial, a CPO would be favorable in almost every sector. For example, the finance sector is perhaps one of the main areas where you are dealing with consumer information. It's not just the finance sector, basically anywhere you have and store customers information, a CPO would be a good idea as they will help to ensure that customers data is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Does Your Company Need A Chief Privacy Officer?|url = http://www.informationintersection.com/2012/10/does-your-company-need-a-chief-privacy-officer/|website = Information Intersection|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some drawbacks to having a CPO in your organization, the first being cost. According to [[payscale.com]] the average salary for a CPO in the United States is over 6 figures, roughly about $107,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy &amp; Security Officer Salary|url = http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Chief_Privacy_%2526_Security_Officer/Salary|website = www.payscale.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drawback to having a CPO in your business would be that some may argue that it's just too much power for one person to have, especially if they are dealing with personal information{{who|date=November 2015}}.

The '''Connecticut Business Hall of Fame''', established in 2005, is an organization created to feature the accomplishments of companies and business leaders and to promote future business activities in the state of [[Connecticut]] in the United States.

Connecticut has often been in competition with the states of [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].  Both [[Boston]] and the [[New York City]] metro area have attracted better [[economic development]] opportunities than Connecticut.  In the past, Connecticut officials have fought to keep [[Defense industry|defense]] dollars in the state and have started to promote Connecticut's [[tourism]] industry to national audiences.

Connecticut has also become the home of two of the world's largest [[casino]]s, the [[Mohegan Sun]] and [[Foxwoods]]. These facilities have grown into huge entertainment and resort complexes that pull resources from all over Connecticut and contribute to the region.  During 2006, the state slowly announced a couple of economic incentive programs in order to attract national business interest.  Through the state legislature, an initiative was passed to provide [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film production companies with significant tax credits]] in order to stimulate economic growth.  The state also stepped up its involvement with grant and incentive tax breaks to establish several new business and residential development programs including one at the former [[United Technologies Corporation]] campus in [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]].  State government and private companies have also taken the lead in aggressively marketing and promoting [[minor league]] sports clubs, as well as [[College athletics|college sports]] including [[University of Connecticut]] [[Connecticut Huskies|basketball and football teams]].

The Connecticut Business [[Hall of Fame]] was created to solidify Connecticut's role in the global business community.  Director of the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame, Ron Dresner stated that he intends to build an awareness globally about how Connecticut has contributed to the success of so many businesses throughout the years and how talented business leaders flourished in Connecticut.

Already, the organization has gathered support throughout the state as it has created an extensive monthly business networking program which has featured speakers such as then [[Connecticut Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]], Connecticut Technology Council President Matthew Nemerson and ''Business New Haven'' publisher Mitchell Young.  Other featured speakers and panelists included business management consultants/authors Charles Miller and Claire Thaine, [[Goodwin College]] president Mark Scheinberg, Connecticut First Coalition Director Charles LeConche and Middlesex Chamber of Commerce President Larry McHugh.

During its first year, the organization has attracted over 10,000 regional business professionals to the various networking and industry-specific events that it co-sponsored.  From business technology updates for business owners, monthly networking events to sales seminars for managers, the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame has made an impact connecting companies throughout the state.

==Class of 2006==
In March 2007, the organization held its first Annual Induction Award Ceremony in Hartford.  Named as the "Class of 2006" and inducted were Herb Barker, CEO, Barker Specialty Company, Cheshire; John Farnham, executive director, Associated General Contractors of Connecticut, Wethersfield; Barry Berman, president and S. Richard Kalt, executive vice-president, [[CRN International]], Hamden; and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurants, Milford.

==Class of 2007==
After a successful second year that included technology, green/environmental, entertainment and financial industry events, the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame in March 2008 inducted the "Class of 2007".  The inductees included two Connecticut business leaders and two Connecticut-based companies.  These inductees are [[Sleepy's|Better Bedding]], East Hartford; Splash Car Wash, Stamford; Chris Campbell, CEO and creative director, Palace Production Center, South Norwalk; and Paul Blanco, managing director, Barnum Financial Group, Shelton.  Several state officials welcomed the "Class of 2007" at the induction ceremonies including [[Secretary of the State of Connecticut|Connecticut Secretary of State]] [[Susan Bysiewicz]], [[Connecticut State Comptroller|Connecticut Comptroller]] [[Nancy Wyman]] and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.  As its role in healthcare is expanding throughout the state, [[Connecticut Children's Medical Center]] COO Wendy Warring addressed the group at the ceremonies about the leading role of quality healthcare for all Connecticut families and the business community's support.

In January 2009, the organization's board of directors expanded to include business and nonprofit leaders from throughout Connecticut including: Jeffrey Cohen, ImageWorks; Ron Dresner, Dennis PR Group; James Duffy, James Duffy Companies; Sam Gejdenson, Sam Gejdenson International; Steven Goldthwaite, CyberSecurity Systems; Richard Greenfield, NRG Publishing; Jonathan Hochman, Hochman &amp; Associates; William Kenney, Networking You; Charles H. Miller, The Coaching Partnership; Ira Nozik, Nozik Photography; Laurie O'Neil, Innovative Financial Services; Rene Rodriguez, Babbalu.com; Mike Scricca, Connecticut Technology Council; and Fred Wergeles, Fred Wergeles &amp; Associates.

==Class of 2008==
The Connecticut Business Hall of Fame kicked off its third year with a scheduled statewide networking event in Hartford in April 2009 with featured speaker Rob Simmons, former U.S. Congressman and presently the official business advocate for the state of Connecticut.  In April 2009, the organization held its third annual induction event.  With an emphasis on community involvement and over 200 nominations considered, the "Class of 2008" included leaders Gloria McAdam, Foodshare and Jim Barnes, Oakleaf Waste Management along with the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, Stafford Motor Speedway and Alcoa Howmet.  Ron Dresner, director, Connecticut Business Hall of Fame, welcomed guest speakers Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and Connecticut Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz at the event.

In April 2010, the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame held its annual induction ceremony in Hartford.  Welcoming the "Class of 2009", Ron Dresner, director of the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame, along with over 350 attendees congratulated Manafort Brothers, Inc.; Goodwin College; Community Renewal Team; William McGurk from Rockville Bank; and Doug Gunthrie from Comcast as the newest inductees.

'''Downtown Berkeley''' is the [[central business district]] of the city of [[Berkeley, California]], United States, around the intersection of [[Shattuck Avenue]] and Center Street, and extending north to Hearst Avenue, south to Dwight Way, west to Martin Luther King Jr. Way, and east to Oxford Street.  Downtown is the mass transit hub of Berkeley, with several [[AC Transit]] and [[Bear Transit|UC Berkeley]] bus lines converging on the city's busiest [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station, as well as the location of Berkeley's [[civic center]], [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], and [[Berkeley City College]].

==History==
[[File:Berkeley California1994.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Addison Street, between Oxford Street and Shattuck Avenue, in 1994. The historic [[Studio Building (Berkeley, California)|Studio Building]] is the second building on the right.]]
The area was formerly a settlement site of the Huichin/Chochen band of the [[Ohlone]] indigenous people. Artifacts were found in the 1950s during the digging of a basement on Kittredge Street. The site was probably associated with the proximity of [[Strawberry Creek]] which ran along what is today's Allston Way. During the days when the land was part of the vast [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]], a ford existed across Strawberry Creek beneath a clump of oak trees at approximately the intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Allston Way. The road or trail which crossed here connected the ranch houses of two of the Peralta brothers, [[José Domingo Peralta|Domingo]] and Vicente.

Following the [[Mexican–American War]], four Americans laid claim to four equal strips of land in what is now downtown Berkeley, bounded on the north by what is today the alignment of Addison Street, and on the south, by Dwight Way. Among these claimants was [[Francis K. Shattuck]]. Shattuck's portion lay west of what is now Shattuck Avenue. He built a house here at the site of what is today the [[Hotel Shattuck Plaza]]. The county road going to Oakland along his property was informally called "Shattuck's road", but the planners of the [[College of California]] dubbed the street "Guyot" on their plat map. That name never caught on and the street name was upgraded to "Shattuck Avenue". In the 1890s, Strawberry Creek was [[culvert]]ed through the downtown section, the oak trees were removed, and Shattuck and University Avenues were improved. Nonetheless, the area developed slowly until about the time of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], after which it developed rapidly.

The [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] constructed its [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]] line connecting the area to the [[Oakland Pier]] and the [[Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental rail line]] in 1876, two years before the people living near the [[University of California]] and in [[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]] incorporated Berkeley. The end of the line at University Avenue was initially called the "Terminus" until the line was extended north, after which time it was called [[Berkeley station (Southern Pacific Railroad)|Berkeley Station]]. In the early years, downtown Berkeley was synonymous with "Berkeley Station", referring to the area around the railroad depot. The railroad served both passengers and freight at Berkeley Station. A telegraph office and [[Wells Fargo]] office were situated across the street from the depot.

The [[Key System]] opened up its electric train service to San Francisco from Downtown Berkeley in 1903. The Southern Pacific responded by electrifying and extending its lines in Berkeley in 1911 ([[East Bay Electric Lines]]) and moved its downtown freight operations just south of downtown to Ward Street and Shattuck. In 1941, however, SP ended its electric commuter train service. From then until April 1958, downtown Berkeley's commuter train service was solely in the hands of the Key System. Buses replaced the trains from 1958 to the present. In 1973, BART opened its own [[Downtown Berkeley Station|Berkeley station]] at Center Street and Shattuck, once again providing electric train service to San Francisco and elsewhere in the Bay Area.

For several years after the Key System's F train stopped running on Shattuck, its tracks (originally, the old SP tracks) remained in the pavement of Shattuck Avenue. Parking islands were created along the centerline of Shattuck overlapping the northbound tracks. In the early 1960s, a series of fountains were constructed which replaced some of these parking islands, extending from Center to Haste. The fountains quickly became the favorite targets of vandals who regularly put bubble bath in them. They were soon removed, just before Shattuck Avenue was torn up for the BART subway construction.

In early 2007 the Marine Recruiting Center for the northern [[Bay Area]] relocated from [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] to downtown Berkeley in order to be closer to the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="DC Protests Follow"&gt;{{cite web

==Commercial issues==
[[Image:Berkeleynight.jpg|thumb|300px|right|University Avenue at night.]]
Berkeley's downtown section has been the principal commercial center of Berkeley since the railroad station was built.  However, it has had to compete with the secondary commercial sections which emerged starting as early as the 19th century.  Three of these in the past were [[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]] (Ocean View), North Berkeley (Berryman's) and the [[Telegraph Avenue|Telegraph]] area immediately south of the University of California campus.  Others which came a bit later were the [[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood]] area along College near Ashby, [[San Pablo Avenue]], [[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]] (formerly the [[Lorin District]]) and [[Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California|Thousand Oaks]] along [[Solano Avenue]].

Starting in the 1970s it also had to compete with the emergence of major shopping centers and malls outside of Berkeley, especially [[El Cerrito Plaza (Shopping Center)|El Cerrito Plaza]], [[Hilltop Mall]], and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]].  These resulted in the loss of several formerly prominent downtown businesses, including two large department stores; Hink's, whose building was converted to a movie theater and several smaller stores, and [[J. C. Penney]].  Contributing factors which continue to date are high commercial rents, a shortage of street parking and convenient garages, and higher consumer prices than those offered elsewhere.  The latter has been a problem since the earliest days as there has always been a tendency to view the University population as a captive consumer base.  The city has created an official [[arts district]] along Addison Street and passed laws restricting business hours in other neighborhoods in an attempt to increase night time activity downtown.  To address the parking situation, the city is planning to install a system of digital signs to direct drivers to available parking spaces downtown.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20071018/ai_n21065758]

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=March 2013}}

Today, Berkeley's downtown is highly eclectic, with numerous small businesses.  Currently, the Berkeley City Council passed a new downtown area plan in an attempt to make the Downtown more sustainable and concentrate future development in the downtown area in conjunction with the announced plan of the University to build a hotel, conference center, and museum along Center Street. In 2009 local petition gatherers gained enough signatures to obstruct implementation of the plan, angering many residents of Berkeley, including the coalition of the Sierra Club, the Greenbelt Alliance, [[Berkeley Food and Housing Project|Berkeley Food &amp; Housing Project]] and TransForm. The opponents argue that the new development calls for buildings that are too tall and have housing that is too expensive. Supporters of the downtown plan counter that the plan requires 20% affordable housing units and a denser downtown reduces carbon emissions.

In recent years, Shattuck Avenue has seen the opening of a number of new high-profile restaurants, such as [[Revival Bar and Kitchen]].

==Government==
Downtown Berkeley is a part of Berkeley's District 4 and is represented by Kate Harrison. It is considered a left-leaning neighborhood in civic politics.

'''Eli Lilly and Company''' is a global [[pharmaceutical]] company headquartered in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], with offices in 18 countries. Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by Col. [[Eli Lilly]], a pharmaceutical [[chemist]] and veteran of the [[American Civil War]], after whom the company was named.

Lilly's notable achievements include being the first company to mass-produce the [[polio vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk]], and [[insulin]]. It was one of the first [[pharmaceutical]] companies to produce human [[insulin]] using [[recombinant DNA]] including Humulin ([[Insulin (medication)|insulin medication]]), Humalog ([[insulin lispro]]), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the US, Basaglar ([[insulin glargine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2015/12/28/10-all-time-greatest-eli-lilly-drugs/76070470/ | title=10 all-time greatest Eli Lilly drugs | first=Jeff | last=Swiatek | work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] | date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilly is currently the largest manufacturer of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] medications and produces Prozac ([[fluoxetine]]), Dolophine ([[methadone]]), Cymbalta ([[duloxetine]]), and Zyprexa ([[olanzapine]]).

The company is ranked 132nd on the [[Fortune 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/eli-lilly/ | title=Fortune 500: Eli Lilly | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked 221st on the [[Forbes Global 2000]] list of the largest public companies in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/eli-lilly-co/ | title=Forbes: The World's Biggest Public Companies | work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 252nd on the Forbes list of America's Best Employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/lilly/ | title=Forbes: America's Best Employers | work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a [[Paris, Illinois]], drugstore with James W. Binford.&lt;ref name=b911&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis|author=David J. Bodenhamer and Robert G. Barrows, eds. |publisher=Indiana University Press | location =Bloomington and Indianapolis | year=1994 |page=911| isbn=0-253-31222-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.&lt;ref name=LillyBio&gt;{{cite web| title =Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898) | work = | publisher =Lilly Archives  | date =January 2008 | url =http://www.in.gov/governorhistory/mitchdaniels/files/Press/lillybio.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =m6&gt;{{cite book | author=James H.

===Early days: 1870–1900===
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."&lt;ref name=IHSHBR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=b540 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Indiana Historical Society]] recreated a replica of the first Lilly laboratory on Pearl Street for its exhibition, "You Are There: ''Eli Lilly at the Beginning''," at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis. The temporary exhibition (October 1, 2016, to January 20, 2018) also includes costumed interpreters portraying Colonel Lilly, among others.

Lilly Sr.|Josiah]] (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.&lt;ref name=p59/&gt;&lt;ref name = m6/&gt;

One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was [[quinine]], a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.&lt;ref name=p57&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4470|1876|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|11318|1877|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars),&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =2 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|48000|1879|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878.

The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR14&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =1 and 4 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m27&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective [[patent medicine]]s. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR1/&gt; Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company's other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.&lt;ref name=p59/&gt;

In 1881, Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.&lt;ref name=Kahn23/&gt; Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science|Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]] in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.&lt;ref name=b913&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for [[syphilis]], some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as [[eczema]] and [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref name=m27/&gt;&lt;ref name=MadisonM72&gt;{{cite journal | author =James H.

As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert M.

[[File:Eli Lilly Medicines, 1906.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of Lilly's [[throat lozenge]]s from a 1906 sales book.]]

Around 1890, Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.&lt;ref name = b911/&gt;&lt;ref name = p60&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.&lt;ref name=PodczekJones&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Capsules|author1=Fridrun Podczeck  |author2=Brian E. Jones, |pages=12–13|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |year=2004 |location=Chicago|isbn=0-85369-568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did&amp;mdash;manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups".&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt; The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs than the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt;

In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.&lt;ref name=p60/&gt; As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, [[Eli Lilly (industrialist)|Eli]] and [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.|Josiah Jr.]] (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="IHSHBR256"&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | pages =2, 5 and 6 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1898|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=bb912&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', pp. 17–18, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', pp. 51, 112–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.&lt;ref name=IHSindustry3&gt;{{cite web | title =The Pharmaceutical Industry in Indiana | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | page =3 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/The%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20in%20Indiana.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-20 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130608203946/http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/The%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20in%20Indiana.pdf | archive-date =8 June 2013 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1905|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt;

===Modernization:1900–1940===
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt; Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also began constructions of the [[Lilly Biological Laboratories]], a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Taylor|title =Indiana: A New Historical Guide | page =481|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SHAARD"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html| title = Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) | publisher = Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology | format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2016-04-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url =https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/1b3be/N/Lilly_Biological_Labs_Hancock_CO_Nom.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Lilly Biological Laboratories| accessdate = 2016-04-01| author=Eugene F. Rodman| format = PDF| date=April 1976}} and Accompanying photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR1/&gt; Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.&lt;ref name=MadisonM73&gt;Madison, "Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals," ''Business and Economic History'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1917 ''Scientific American'' article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".&lt;ref name=MadisonM73/&gt; One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.&lt;ref name = p59&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.&lt;ref name=PodczekJones/&gt;

Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.&lt;ref name=MadisonM73/&gt; In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MadisonM74&gt;Madison, "Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals," ''Business and Economic History'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."&lt;ref name=MadisonM74/&gt; This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name="IHSHBR256"/&gt;

During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt; In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, [[J. J. R. Macleod]], [[Frederick G. Banting]], and [[Charles H. Best]], were working on the development of [[insulin]] for treatment of diabetes.&lt;ref name=MadisonM76/&gt; Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the [[University of Toronto]] scientists to mass-produce insulin.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 55&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Sickening sweet|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=12–15|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/sickening-sweet|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.&lt;ref name=MLilly61&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."&lt;ref name=MadisonM76/&gt;

The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.&lt;ref name="IHSHBR256"/&gt; In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two [[Harvard University]] scientists, [[George R. Minot]] and [[William P. Murphy]]. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with [[George Whipple]], a [[University of Rochester]] scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 66&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.&lt;ref name=MLilly67&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR5/&gt; That same year [[Eli Lilly (industrialist)|Eli Lilly]], the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 28&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 62&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new [[Lilly Research Laboratories]], "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.&lt;ref name=MLilly111&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in [[England]], with headquarters in [[London]] and a manufacturing plant in [[Basingstoke, England|Basingstoke]].&lt;ref name=IHSHBR5/&gt;&lt;ref name=MLilly111/&gt;

===Expansion: 1940–1970===
[[World War II]] brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of [[Thiomersal|Merthiolate]] and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the [[American Red Cross]] to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".&lt;ref name="Madison, Eli Lilly, p. 105"&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 65 and 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MLilly65&gt;{{cite book | last = Madison | first = James H. | title =Eli Lilly: A Life, 1885&amp;ndash;1977 | page=65| publisher =Indiana Historical Society | year =1989 | location =Indianapolis | isbn =0-87195-047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing [[penicillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 107&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

International operations expanded even further during World War II.&lt;ref name=MLilly111/&gt; Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref name=MLilly111/&gt;

At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.&lt;ref name=b540&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.]] (Joe).&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 91, 119&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt; During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.&lt;ref name="bb912"/&gt; He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 120 and 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.

Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[Polio vaccine|poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine]]. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.&lt;ref name=IHSpolio5&gt;{{cite web | title =Polio and Eli Lilly and Company | work =  | publisher =Indiana Historical Society  |location=Indianapolis | page=5| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/Polio%20and%20Lilly%20background%20essay.pdf| format =pdf  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.&lt;ref name=IHSpolio6&gt;{{cite web | title =Polio and Eli Lilly and Company | work =  | publisher =Indiana Historical Society  |location=Indianapolis | page=6| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/Polio%20and%20Lilly%20background%20essay.pdf| format =pdf  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.

During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in [[Lafayette, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=b541&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased [[antibiotic]] production with its patent on [[erythromycin]]. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of [[veterinary]] pharmaceuticals. In 1969, the company opened a new plant in [[Clinton, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=b541/&gt;

After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR6/&gt; In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in [[Liverpool]], England. In 1968, Lilly built its first research facility, the [[Lilly Research Centre]] Limited, outside the United States near [[London|London, England]] in [[Surrey]].

===1970-present===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, [[Cefalexin|Keflex]], in 1971; a heart drug, [[Dobutamine|Dobutrex]], in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a [[leukemia]] drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, [[Benoxaprofen|Oraflex]]; and an analgesic, [[Dextropropoxyphene|Darvon]]. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.

In 1971, the company became a component of the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]].

To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]] for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]] in 1987 for $657 million.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR7&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =7 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and [[intravenous]] fluid infusion monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/14/archives/eli-lilly-signs-agreement-to-acquire-ivac-corp.html?nytmobile=0|title=Eli Lilly Signs Agreement To Acquire Ivac Corp.|last=Times|first=Special to the New York|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of [[Artificial pacemaker|heart pacemakers]] in 1977. In 1980, Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s, Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1989, a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and [[Dow Chemical]] created DowElanco. In 1997, Lilly sold its 40% share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to [[Dow AgroSciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-16/business/fi-59266_1_dow-elanco | title=Dow to Buy Lilly's 40% Stake in Dow Elanco | agency=[[Reuters]] | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=May 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR8&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =8 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.&lt;ref name=Kokomo73194&gt;{{cite news | last =Armor | first =Nancy | title =New Lilly Chief Nurtures Change | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomo, IN | page = | language = | publisher = | date =1994-07-31 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Vaughn Bryson was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.&lt;ref name=KokomoTrib62893/&gt; In 1993 [[Randall L. Tobias]], a vice-chairman of [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] and Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after "product and competitive pressures" had "steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992."&lt;ref name=KokomoTrib62693&gt;{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =Eli Lilly CEO Resigns in Dispute | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomi, IN | page = | language = | publisher = | date =1993-06-26 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership the company "cut costs and narrowed its mission".&lt;ref name=IHSHBR89&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =8 and 9 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. [[Sidney Taurel]], former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.

In 1998, Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with [[Icos|Icos Corporation]] (ICOS), a [[Bothell, Washington]]-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize [[Tadalafil|Cialis]], a product for the treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]]. In October 2006, Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Associated Press| title= Lilly Increases Offer for Icos; Shareholders' Vote Is Put Off |work=[[The New York Times]]  |date=2006-12-19 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/business/19drug.html | accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share.

==Collaborative research==
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR12&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =1 and 2 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberhardt and Evans were [[Purdue University]] graduates. See {{cite web | title=Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page=2 | url=http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2013-02-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date=29 July 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase&amp;mdash;its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."&lt;ref name=b540 /&gt; The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MLilly55&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed [[insulin]] at the [[University of Toronto]] significantly impacted the company’s future.&lt;ref name=MLilly55/&gt; Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=MadisonM76&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR4&gt;{{cite web| title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company| page =4| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf| archive-date =29 July 2016| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.

===Publicly funded research===
In addition to internal research and development activities, Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the [[European Commission]] to improve the safety of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Alliances | work = | publisher =Genedata | location =Basel, Switzerland | url =http://www.genedata.com/alliances.html | accessdate =2013-02-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Consortium&gt;{{cite web | title = InnoMed PredTox Consortium Members Present Preliminary Study Results | publisher =Genedata | location = Basel, Switzerland | date =2008-05-15 | url =http://www.genedata.com/index.php?id=211&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5bpS%5d=1259741735&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=22&amp;cHash=139a0c79812ccfccf9dbf2a79a1001ab| archive-url =https://archive.is/20130411003210/http://www.genedata.com/index.php?id=211&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1259741735&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=22&amp;cHash=139a0c79812ccfccf9dbf2a79a1001ab| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2013-04-11}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A.

==Pharmaceutical brands==
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included [[insulin]], which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.&lt;ref name=MLilly65/&gt; Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are [[cephalosporin]], [[erythromycin]], and [[Prozac]] (fluoxetine), a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) for the treatment of [[clinical depression]]. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] and [[mental health]]-related conditions, including [[clinical depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[narcotic]] addiction, [[insomnia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Cialis===
{{further|Tadalafil}}
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] (tadalafil), a competitor to [[Pfizer]]'s blockbuster [[Viagra]] for [[erectile dysfunction]]. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with [[biotechnology]] company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.&lt;ref&gt;With its television advertisement for Cialis during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show]], Eli Lilly was one of several companies whose costly 2004 [[Super Bowl]] Halftime advertisements were largely overshadowed by the [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cymbalta===
{{further|Duloxetine}}
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, [[Duloxetine|Cymbalta]], a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history.  It is also used in the treatment of [[fibromyalgia]], [[neuropathy]], [[chronic pain]] and [[osteoarthritis]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Gemzar===
{{further|Gemcitabine}}
In 1996, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[gemcitabine|Gemzar]] for the treatment of [[pancreatic cancer]]. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU [[chemotherapy]] and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell [[lung cancer]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Methadone===
{{further|Methadone}}
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of [[methadone]], an [[analgesic]] used frequently in the treatment of [[heroin]], [[opium]] and other [[opioid]] and [[narcotic]] [[drug addiction]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Prozac===
{{further|Fluoxetine}}
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of [[serotonin]] within the [[human brain]].  It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other [[central nervous system]] disorders such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], and panic disorders.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Prozac in popular culture====
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. ''[[Prozac Nation (book)|Prozac Nation]]'' (1994), an autobiographical book by [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]], was turned into a [[Prozac Nation (film)|film]] of the same name in 2001 and starred [[Christina Ricci]]. ''[[Listening to Prozac]]'' (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. ''Talking Back to Prozac'' (1994), by psychiatrist [[Peter Breggin]], focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper [[Jay-Z]] referenced Prozac in the song, "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)|Nigga What, Nigga Who]]" (1998). In [[HBO]]'s fictional series, ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Tony Soprano]]'s use of Prozac is periodically referenced.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Secobarbital===
{{further|Secobarbital}}
Eli Lilly has manufactured [[Secobarbital]], a [[barbiturate]] derivative with [[anaesthetic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]] and [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of [[epilepsy]], temporary [[insomnia]] and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and [[anxiolysis]] in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Secobarbital overdoses====
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]]. On September 18, 1970, [[rock music|rock]] guitarist legend [[Jimi Hendrix]] died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress [[Judy Garland]]. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1966) by [[Jacqueline Susann]] in which three highly successful [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Thimerosal===
{{further|Thiomersal}}
Eli Lilly has developed the [[vaccine]] preservative [[thiomersal]] (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to [[Autolysis (biology)|autolyze]]. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the [[University of Maryland]] with support of a Lilly research fellowship."&lt;ref name=MLilly65/&gt;

===Zyprexa===

Zyprexa ([[Olanzapine]]) (for [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[off-label]] uses) Released in 1996, (see criminal prosecution section) it was the company's best selling drug through 2010, when the [[patent]] expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=Duff|title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?pagewanted=all | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.&lt;ref name=MLilly112&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR6&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | page =6 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR6/&gt; In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E.

In 2006, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named Eli Lilly and Company one of the top 100 companies in the United States for which to work. Also in 2006, ''[[Barron's Magazine]]'' named the company among the top 500 best managed companies in the U.S.
 
In 2012, ''Working Mothers'' magazine named Lilly one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" for the eighteenth consecutive year. ''Working Mother'' reported that in 2012 forty-eight percent of Lilly’s U.S. employees and thirty-four percent of its U.S. managers and executives were women.&lt;ref name=WorkingMother&gt;{{cite journal | title =Working Mother Report: Meet the 2012 100 Best Companies | journal =Working Mother | volume =35 | issue =6 | page =46 | publisher =Bonnier Working Mother Media Inc. | location =New York | date =Oct–Nov 2012 | language = | url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The company was named one of the top 10 best companies for working mothers in 2004 by ''Working Mothers'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community service===
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2/&gt; Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,&lt;ref name=b399&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charity Organization Society]], a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by [[United Way of America|United Way]].&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 402&amp;ndash;03, 911&amp;ndash;12, and 560&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.&lt;ref name=b91012&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 910&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3 /&gt; Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 [[Johnstown Flood]].&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; 
 
In 1917, Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR5&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | page =5 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.&lt;ref name="Madison, Eli Lilly, p. 105"/&gt;

===Lilly Endowment===
{{main|Lilly Endowment}}
In 1937, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the [[Lilly Endowment]], a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.&lt;ref name=MLilly20506&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 205&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eli Lilly and Company Foundation===
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Meek  | first =Heather  | title =Lilly, Eli  | work =  | publisher =LearningToGive.org and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University | url =http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper108.html  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{See also|List of largest pharmaceutical settlements}}
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies.  Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of [[Bovine somatotropin|BGH]] having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from [[Monsanto]].

===Prozac===

A landmark study found that [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) was more likely to increase overall suicidal behavior. 14.7% of the patients (n = 44) on fluoxetine had suicidal events, compared to 6.3% in the psychotherapy group and 8.4% from the combined treatment group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702701/pdf/nihms101259.pdf | pmc=2702701 | pmid=19552869 | volume=70 | title=Suicidal events in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) | year=2009 | journal=J Clin Psychiatry | pages=741–7 | last1 = Vitiello | first1 = B | last2 = Silva | first2 = SG | last3 = Rohde | first3 = P | last4 = Kratochvil | first4 = CJ | last5 = Kennard | first5 = BD | last6 = Reinecke | first6 = MA | last7 = Mayes | first7 = TL | last8 = Posner | first8 = K | last9 = May | first9 = DE | last10 = March | first10 = JS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eli Lilly, the manufacturer, and the lead researcher did not make these findings obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undark.org/article/wilo-lenzer-danger-within-us/|title=When the Cure Is the Cause: The Case of the Green Hairy Tongue|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several internal documents, which were released by the [[British Medical Journal]], indicated a link between use of Prozac and suicidal or violent behavior. The FDA has warned that Prozac and similar antidepressants could cause agitation, panic attacks and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fda-reportedly-reviewing-eli-lilly-prozac-papers|title=Eli Lilly in Prozac controversy|first=CBS|last=MarketWatch|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents revealed that Eli Lilly knew about this as early as 1984, years before the drug was FDA-approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahrp.org/eli-lilly-prozac-documents-what-do-they-reveal/|title=Eli Lilly Prozac Documents: What do They Reveal? - AHRP|date=26 October 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAFTA Suit===
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs.  The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854 | title=Eli Lilly files $500M NAFTA suit against Canada over drug patents | author=Stastna, Kazi | publisher=CBC | date=2013-09-13 | accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal prosecution===
{{See also|Olanzapine#Controversy, lawsuits and settlements|James Gottstein#Eli Lilly memos}}
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate [[qui tam]] lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing olanzapine (branded Zyprexa), an [[antipsychotic]] medication, for uses not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for [[off-label]] uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The [[US Justice Department]] said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a US criminal prosecution of any kind.&lt;ref name="usdoj-2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/January/09-civ-038.html | title=Eli Lilly and Company Agrees to Pay $1.415 Billion to Resolve Allegations of Off-label Promotion of Zyprexa | date=January 15, 2009 | work=09-civ-038 | publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/pae/News/Pr/2009/jan/lillyrelease.pdf | title=Pharmaceutical Company Eli Lilly to Pay Record $1.415 Billion for Off-Label Drug Marketing | work=United States Attorney, Eastern District of Pennsylvania | publisher=United States Department of Justice | date=January 15, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203119/http://www.justice.gov/usao/pae/News/Pr/2009/jan/lillyrelease.pdf | archivedate=17 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "That was a blemish for us," [[John C. Lechleiter]], CEO of Lilly, told ''The New York Times''. "We don't ever want that to happen again.

'''Fernando Fernández''' (c.1850&amp;ndash;1940) was the founder of the oldest [[rum]] producing company in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;"The Rough Guide to Puerto Rico (Rough Guide Puerto Rico)"; by Stephen Keeling; page 53; Publisher: Rough Guides; {{ISBN|1-4053-8261-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4053-8261-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start of a dynasty==
[[Image:El Molino de Santa Ana en Bayamon.jpg|right|120px|thumb|Tower at Hacienda Santa Ana]]

Fernández, was born in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico]]. He was the owner of the Santa Ana plantation located in the city of his birth. The Santa Ana plantation is located on land which was granted to his grandfather (whose name was also Fernando Fernández) by the Spanish Royal Crown in 1797. Fernández's grandfather was a naval captain who fought against [[pirates]] and  [[England|English]] merchant ships. The Spanish Royal Crown granted him this land in recognition of his service to [[Spain]], here he planted [[sugarcane]] and raised cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literarytraveler.com/literary_articles/rum_diary.aspx Traveler]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804, the elder Fernández used a mixture of sugar and honey to process and distill rum.  He aged his product in special barrels which were imported from [[Europe]]. The rum he produced was only for his own personal use and that of his family.

In 1821, various slaves from his [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] were involved in a conspiracy. A slave from another plantation by the name of [[Marcos Xiorro]] planned and organized a revolt against the slave masters. The plans of the revolt were discovered by the Spanish authorities and never took place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3yO7M6gOeUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Conspiracy of Marcos Xiorro]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, he ordered his 127 slaves to build an enormous [[windmill]] shaped like a [[tower]]. The windmill helped to extract the juice from the sugarcane. He would still resort to the use of [[Human resources|manpower]] whenever the wind wasn't strong enough to operate the windmill.&lt;ref name="SJH"&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n34/RumRise-en.html  Puerto Rico Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Fernández's father, Manuel Fernández (birth name: Manuel Fernández y Martínez), inherited the plantation; Manuel Fernández developed the land which consisted of over {{convert|2400|acre|ha|abbr=on}}. Manuel Fernández eventually purchased much of the property adjoining his land and soon became the richest man in Bayamon.&lt;ref name="SJH"/&gt;

==Pedro Fernando Fernández takes charge==
In 1880, Pedro F. Fernández, became the owner of the plantation. Fernández imported a [[still]] from Europe and started to produce rum using the sugar and honey from his land. He developed two different formulas for his rums and he used the same barrels which his grandfather had used before, believing that the rum's unique flavor would be contained in these barrels.&lt;ref name="SJH"/&gt;

Soon the word spread about Fernandez's rum and many friends and nearby families would visit the Santa Ana Hacienda to "sample" the rum. His son went to France to continue his university education; while there he discovered [[cognac]]. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he developed a rum recipe that rivaled the best French cognacs. People started calling Fernando's rum "[[Ron del Barrilito]]" (Rum from the little Barrel). In Puerto Rico, families began switching from "[[brandy]]" and "[[Cognac (drink)|cognac]]", to "Ron del Barrilito". Fernández also produced "Alcoholado Santa Ana" which is a product derived from [[alcohol]] and eucaliptic leaves and is greenish in color. Unlike pure alcohol, Alcoholado Santa Ana does not sting. It is principally used for rub-downs and to refresh the body.&lt;ref name="SJH"/&gt;

==Edmundo B. Fernández, Inc.==
Fernando Fernández died in 1940 in Bayamon.  His great-grandson, who is also named Fernando Fernández, organized the company (which is now called "Edmundo B. Fernández, Inc.") and continues to distribute two brands of "Ron del Barrilito" and "Alcholado Santa Ana" worldwide.  The company's main offices are still located in the Hacienda Santa Ana with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Edmundo Fernández's office is located in the windmill tower built by his ancestor.&lt;ref name="SJH"/&gt;

== Freedom barrel ==
In 1942, a single barrel, which is stored in the "cellar", was put aside with orders that it should only be opened when Puerto Rico becomes a free and independent nation.  When and if that ever happens, the cask (barrel) will be taken to the town square in the center of Bayamon and its contents will be offered free to all those who wish to drink from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rumconnection.com/barrilito-pt-2 |title=A Look at Barrilito – Pt. 2 |date= |website=Rum Connection |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the higher the ratio, the better, because a high ratio indicates the business has less money tied up in fixed assets for each unit of currency of sales revenue. A declining ratio may indicate that the business is over-invested in plant, equipment, or other fixed assets.

In A.A.T. assessments this financial measure is calculated in two different ways.

1. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Total Assets

2. Net Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

'''Fred Lind Alles''' (1851–1945) was a businessman and civic leader in Los Angeles, California, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, serving as secretary or other officer for various committees and for the [[National Irrigation Congress]].

==Professional life==

Lind was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], on  August 2, 1851, and attended the public schools of [[Pitt Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pitt Township]] between 1857 and 1861. He entered the printing business as a "kid press feeder" with the ''[[Pittsburgh Post]]'' at age about 13  in 1864, followed by stints at the ''[[Pittsburgh Dispatch]]'' and the ''[[Workingman's Advocate]],'' also in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=RootsWeb&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jjlangel/Alles/Alles_FL_01.htm Fred Lind Alles, RootsWeb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT19410113/&gt;

He moved to Chicago in 1868, where he was an office worker at the ''[[Religio-Philosophical Journal]],'' being then promoted to foreman and writer. During this time, he attended a public school in [[Saint Charles, Illinois]]. He moved in 1872 to [[Sparta, Illinois]], where he was the publisher of the ''[[Sparta Plain Dealer]].'' In 1874 he was the editor of the [[Belleville, Illinois]], ''Advocate,'' and he worked for the ''Sentinel'' in [[Pontiac, Illinois]], from 1875 to 1883.&lt;ref name=RootsWeb/&gt;

Lind moved to [[Ontario, California]], in 1883, where he was president of the San Antonio Water Company in 1884 and 1885. Between 1884 and 1888 he was the publisher of ''[[Rural Californian]]'' magazine. In 1887, to recover his health, he made a trip to [[Alaska]], accompanied by Senators [[George Graham Vest]] of Missouri, [[Charles B. Farwell]] of Illinois and [[J. Donald Cameron]] of Pennsylvania, and returned "weighing fourteen pounds more than when I started."&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=318580722&amp;sid=22&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Alaska: Fred L. Alles Tells About His Hyperborean Trip," ''Los Angeles Times,'' August 13, 1887, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 he became temporary managing editor of the ''[[Riverside Press-Enterprise|Riverside Press and Horticulturalist]],'' but the next year he sold his [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] orange grove and moved back to Los Angeles, where he became secretary and general manager of the Los Angeles Printing Company between 1890 and 1902.&lt;ref name=RootsWeb/&gt; In 1890, a strike by printers
&lt;blockquote&gt;paralyzed the composing rooms of all the Los Angeles newspapers. Alles rounded up his print shop employees and dashed to the rescue, taking personal charge of the composing room of The Times and putting two of his foremen in charge of printing The Tribune and the Herald. One of his proudest possessions [in 1941] is a letter from Gen. [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] thanking him for his efforts, "without which it would have been necessary for The Times to temporarily suspend publication.&lt;ref name=LAT19410113/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1897 he became business manager of the ''[[Los Angeles Express (newspaper)|Los Angeles Express]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=325742572&amp;sid=32&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "The New Regime," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 16, 1897, page 7]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1901 he established his own printing business, which he maintained until 1905.&lt;ref name=RootsWeb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=319314332&amp;sid=17&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Southern Californian Fair at Chicago," ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 26, 1885, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=327145162&amp;sid=25&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "News and Business," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 1, 1902, page 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=317810182&amp;sid=41&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Personal News," ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 16, 1889, page 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alles was honored in January 1941 for his life's work when a portrait of him by artist [[Arthur Cahill]] was unveiled in Los Angeles's  prestigious [[California Club]].&lt;ref name="LAT19410113"&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=410722991&amp;sid=10&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Portrait Honors Fred Lind Alles," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 13, 1941, page 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1889 Alles had become commissioner of immigration for the Southern California Immigration Association and made a four-month trip to Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Pennsylvania and West Virginia that year. On his return, he was quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everywhere I found people interested in . . . Southern California, and all were anxious to obtain some reliable information about our soil, our climate, our resources and our future prospects. . . . The impression that this is only a country for rich men is everywhere present, and people were surprised on being told that we have an abundance of cheap lands which can be profitably worked by men of ordinary intelligence possessed of muscle which they are not afraid to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=317962072&amp;sid=28&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "A Bird's-Eye View," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 1, 1889, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1889, Alles began circulating a petition to change the name of Fort Street in [[downtown Los Angeles]] to Broadway southward between First and Tenth Streets and to North Broadway northward of First Street,&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=317966512&amp;sid=42&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "City in Brief," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 6, 1889, page 8]&lt;/ref&gt; At first the petition "received but little encouragement," the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported, "as Fort Street is one of the oldest landmarks in Los Angeles, and the impression seemed to prevail that the name should not be blotted out,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=318099432&amp;sid=43&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP  "Public Works," ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 7, 1890, page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually the argument that "Fort Street" sounded too much like "Fourth Street" prevailed, and the name changes were adopted.&lt;ref name="LAT19410113"/&gt;

Controversy enveloped Alles in 1895 when [[C.M. Heintz]], his successor as secretary of the National Irrigation Congress, accused Alles of falsely claiming that the congress in Albuquerque, New Mexoco,  had voted to thank both Alles and congress chairman [[W.E. Smythe|William E. Smythe]] for their service after they had announced they would not seek re-election to their seats. Alles was defended editorially in articles in both the ''Times'' and the ''Los Angeles Herald.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=322049762&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Heintz et Alles," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 22, 1895, page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=322054252&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Alles Is Suspicious of Heintz," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 25, 1895, page 12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=322061542&amp;sid=34&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Who's a Liar?"

==Personal life==

Lind was born August 2, 1851, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Henry Alles or Alois and Elizabeth Kaufman. In his later years, he recalled that he once sat on a streetcar seat next to former president [[Martin Van Buren]], who died in 1862, when Alles was about seven. He was married to Mary Elizabeth Allen in Sparta, Illinois, on  December 4, 1873, in a double wedding with Mary's sister, Avis. Lind and Mary Elizabeth had three children, Allen Alles, Clara Lavinia Greaves and Lind Chesley Alles. Mary Elizabeth died on July 23, 1923, at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=RootsWeb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=321024152&amp;sid=6&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Events in Society," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 27, 1903, page A-7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=409343041&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alles died March 7, 1945, at the age of 90.

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''Freedom of contract''' is the freedom of private or public individuals and groups (of any legal entity) to form nonviolent contracts without [[Economic regulation|government restrictions]].  This is opposed to government restrictions such as [[minimum wage|minimum-]] or [[maximum wage|maximum-wage laws]], [[competition laws]], [[economic sanctions]], restrictions on [[price fixing]], or restrictions on contracting with [[second-class citizens]] or [[undocumented workers]].  The freedom to contract is the underpinning of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and is a cornerstone of [[Free market|free-market]] [[libertarianism]].  Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general [[freedom of choice|freedom to choose]] with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.

==History==
[[Henry James Sumner Maine]] proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from [[social status]] to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by [[Robert Nozick]], sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a "[[night-watchman state|minimal state]]."

==United States==
===''Lochner v. New York''===
{{Main|Lochner v. New York}}
In 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to "due process." Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] used the [[due process clause]] to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]] wrote for the majority: "Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment."

Writing in dissent, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] accused the majority of basing its decision on [[laissez-faire]] ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that "Liberty of Contract" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution.

===Afterward===
In his "Liberty of Contract" (1909), [[Roscoe Pound]] critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were "simply wrong" from the standpoint of common law and "even from that of a sane individualism" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of [[usury]] and that the two were "of the same type" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such "academic" and "artificial" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a "lost respect for the courts" but predicted a "bright" future for labor legislation (486-487).&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe Pound, "Liberty of Contract," 18 Yale Law Journal 454 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''. In that case the court upheld a [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] law setting a [[minimum wage]].

==United Kingdom==
In the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused "freedom of contract" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in ''[[Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1875) 19 Eq 462, 465, regarding freedom of contract and patents&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir George Jessel MR]]. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In ''[[George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd]]'', [[Lord Denning MR]] compared "freedom of contract" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.

{{quote|''The heyday of freedom of contract''

None of you nowadays will remember the trouble we had – when I was called to the Bar – with exemption clauses. They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of "freedom of contract". But the freedom was all on the side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket or order form or invoice. The big concern said, "Take it or leave it." The little man had no option but to take it. The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, "You must put it in clear words", the big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption clauses or understand them.

It was a bleak winter for our law of contract. It is illustrated by two cases, ''[[Thompson v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Co.]]'' [1930] 1 K.B. 41 (in which there was exemption from liability, not on the ticket, but only in small print at the back of the timetable, and the company were held not liable) and ''[[L'Estrange v. F. Graucob Ltd.]]'' [1934] 2 K.B. 394 (in which there was complete exemption in small print at the bottom of the order form, and the company were held not liable).

''The secret weapon''

Faced with this abuse of power – by the strong against the weak – by the use of the small print of the conditions – the judges did what they could to put a curb upon it. They still had before them the idol, "freedom of contract". They still knelt down and worshipped it, but they concealed under their cloaks a secret weapon. They used it to stab the idol in the back. This weapon was called "the true construction of the contract". They used it with great skill and ingenuity. They used it so as to depart from the natural meaning of the words of the exemption clause and to put upon them a strained and unnatural construction. In case after case, they said that the words were not strong enough to give the big concern exemption from liability; or that in the circumstances the big concern was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause. If a ship deviated from the contractual voyage, the owner could not rely on the exemption clause. If a warehouseman stored the goods in the wrong warehouse, he could not pray in aid the limitation clause. If the seller supplied goods different in kind from those contracted for, he could not rely on any exemption from liability. If a shipowner delivered goods to a person without production of the bill of lading, he could not escape responsibility by reference to an exemption clause. In short, whenever the wide words – in their natural meaning – would give rise to an unreasonable result, the judges either rejected them as repugnant to the main purpose of the contract, or else cut them down to size in order to produce a reasonable result. This is illustrated by these cases in the House of Lords: ''[[Glynn v. Margetson &amp; Co.]]'' [1893] A.C. 351; ''[[London and North Western Railway Co. v. Neilson]]'' [1922] 2 A.C. 263; ''[[Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Buerger]]'' [1927] A.C. 1; and by ''[[Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King]]'' [1952] A.C. 192 and ''[[Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd. v. Rambler Cycle Co. Ltd.]]'' [1959] A.C. 576 in the Privy Council; and innumerable cases in the Court of Appeal, culminating in ''[[Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Cleaning Co. Ltd.]]'' [1978] Q.B. 69. But when the clause was itself reasonable and gave rise to a reasonable result, the judges upheld it; at any rate, when the clause did not exclude liability entirely but only limited it to a reasonable amount. So where goods were deposited in a cloakroom or sent to a laundry for cleaning, it was quite reasonable for the company to limit their liability to a reasonable amount, having regard to the small charge made for the service. These are illustrated by ''[[Gibaud v. Great Eastern Railway Co.]]'' [1921] 2 K.B. 426; ''[[Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd]]'' [1945] K.B. 189 and ''[[Gillespie Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd. v Roy Bowles Transport Ltd.]]'' [1973] Q.B. 400.}}

'''Friedrich Karl Flick''' (3 February 1927 – 5 October 2006) was a German-Austrian [[industrialist]] and [[billionaire]].

==Early life==
He was born in Berlin,&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; the youngest son of [[Friedrich Flick]] and Marie Schuss. After his studies, he worked in his father's company. In 1972, when his father died, he inherited the major part of the family business.

==Career==
As the sole owner of the Friedrich Flick Industrial Holding (Industrieverwaltung), he had interests in major companies including [[Daimler-Benz]], [[WR Grace]], Gerling Insurance, [[Buderus]], [[Dynamit Nobel]], Feldmühle and others.

In 1975 he sold his part of Daimler-Benz to the [[Deutsche Bank]] for more than $ 1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/13/archives/bonn-bank-plans-benz-stock-sale-largest-german-institutior-forms-a.html |title=Bonn Bank Plans Benz Stock Sale |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 12, 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major tax liabilities were avoided through "cultivation of the political landscape",—a process that turned into the [[Flick Affair]] in 1983 when it became apparent that about $25 million had been paid to German political parties in return for tax cuts and favorable rulings. Although Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] benefited from the dealings, he claimed he had "no recollections", while others resigned from their posts. In 1985 Flick sold off the remainder of his companies. When Deutsche Bank announced that it had bought his holdings for about $3 billion [[German mark]]s, Flick retired in Austria, where he became a naturalised citizen.

In March 2006, his estimated net worth was $6.1 billion.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thiel|first1=SImon|title=Flick, Billionaire Son of Nazi War Criminal, Dies (Update1)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ajNFph3pc0d8|accessdate=11 November 2015|work=bloomberg|date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married three times and had two children from his second and third marriages. At the time of his death, he was the wealthiest person living in Austria.

He died on 5 October 2006 at his villa in [[Schiefling am See|Auen]] on the [[Wörthersee]], Austria.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt;

In November 2008, it was reported that an oak coffin containing his remains was taken from his family's [[mausoleum]] at a cemetery at [[Velden am Wörther See]], in what [[Federal Police (Austria)|Austrian Federal Police]] believe may be an attempt to extort money from his widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1087756/Body-Nazi-slave-billionaire-stolen-Austrian-cemetery-extortion-attempt.html|title=Body of 'Nazi slave' billionaire stolen from Austrian cemetery in 'extortion attempt'|publisher=Daily Mail|date=2008-11-20|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His widow Ingrid Flick, his third wife, inherited an estimated £4bn. She and his children are now under police guard.  The body was returned in 2009.

'''Geotargeting''' in [[geomarketing]] and [[internet marketing]] is the method of determining the [[geolocation]] of a website visitor and delivering different [[Web content|content]] to that visitor based on their location. This includes country, region/state, city, metro code/[[zip code]], organization, [[IP address]], [[ISP]] or other criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freedman, Mythili Vutukuru, Nick Feamster and Hari Balakrishnan, Geographic Locality of IP Prefixes, Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A common usage of geo targeting is found in [[online advertising]], as well as [[internet television]] with sites such as [[iPlayer]] and [[Hulu]]. In these circumstances, content is often restricted to users geolocated in specific countries; this approach serves as a means of implementing [[digital rights management]]. Use of [[proxy server]]s and [[virtual private network]]s may give a false location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/technology/internet/16privacy.html?ref=technology | title=Many See Privacy on Web as Big Issue, Survey Says | work=Nytimes.com | date=March 15, 2009 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=STEPHANIE CLIFFORD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical information provided by the visitor==
In geotargeting with [[geolocation software]], the [[geolocation]] is based on geographical and other personal information that is provided by the visitor or others.

===Different content by choice===
Typical examples for different content by choice in geotargeting are the [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] websites where users have the choice to select their country location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
In internet marketing and geomarketing, the delivery of different content based on the geographical [[geolocation]] and other personal information is automated.&lt;ref name=automated&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal, “On the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only”, August 4, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is the Ace Hardware website at www.acehardware.com. The company utilizes geolocation software to power the “My Local Ace” section of its website. Based on a site visitor’s location, the website's [[online locator service]] can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsicommerce.com/assets/docs/pdf/generic/CSA-AceHardware-Nov08.pdf Chain Store Age, “Making it Personal”, November, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IP spidering==
The automated discovery of user person/organisation/city-level geolocation information based on [[IP address]]es by [[traceroute]], [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]s, and a combination of other tools and methods is far more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/digital-element-rob-friedman-ip-targeting/|title=Digital Element Finding Demand for Granular IP targeting|accessdate=2010-04-28|date=2009-08-20}} Discussing automated spidering technology&lt;/ref&gt;

It is dependent on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IP addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, especially in light of the fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved and changed due to routers being moved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/google-says-ip-addresses-arent-personal/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;ref=technology&amp;_r=0 | title=Google Says I.P. Addresses Aren’t Personal | work=Nytimes.com | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=SAUL HANSELL}}&lt;/ref&gt; enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/technology/personaltech/how-to-muddy-your-tracks-on-the-internet.html | title=How to Muddy Your Tracks on the Internet | work=Nytimes.com | date=May 2, 2012 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=KATE MURPHY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information, without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of [[Web crawler|Web spidering]].

==IP delivery in SEO==
{{main|Cloaking}}
IP delivery for [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the method of delivering different content to search engine spiders (also known as robots and crawlers) than to human visitors. The determination if the visitor is a known search engine spider is done based on the IP address. SEOs compare the visitor's IP address with their list of IP addresses, which are known to be servers that are owned by a search engine and used to run their crawler applications (spiders). The delivery of different content to search engine spiders than to human visitors is called [[cloaking]] and is against most search engines' webmaster guidelines.&lt;ref name=gguide&gt;[http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769 Google webmaster guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yguide&gt;[http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/indexing/indexing-14.html Yahoo! search content quality guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msguide&gt;[http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm MS Search guidelines for successful indexing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819035446/http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the search engine guidelines seem to imply that any type of cloaking is bad, there are cases where cloaking might be legitimate. The subject is very controversial and SEO experts continue to debate about when cloaking might be acceptable and when not.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Sherman (July 18, 2001), [http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 Search Engine Cloaking: The Controversy Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113063408/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 |date=2007-11-13 }}, ''Search Engine Watch'', retrieved on December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cloaking" via IP delivery works differently from cloaking via "[[user agent]]". While [[IP address spoofing]] is harder than [[User agent#User agent spoofing|user-agent spoofing]] and more reliable, it is also harder to keep the list of IP addresses used by search engines for their crawlers up-to-date. An outdated list with active crawler IP addresses missing enables the search engines to detect the cloaking and may result in a removal of the site from the search engine's index.

Hans Hassle worked as a freelance journalist between 1981 and 1986 focusing on travel journalism. He, amongst other things, was portraying [[indigenous peoples]] from places such as [[Tibet]], [[Indonesia]], and [[New Zealand]].

Hassle has developed a new business model called the Companization &lt;ref&gt;http://www.plantagon.com/governance/companization&lt;/ref&gt;- a hybrid of a non-profit association and a for-profit company that incorporates moral values into an otherwise economic forum by implementing the [[Earth Charter]] and the [[United Nations Global Compact]] into the articles of association of the company.

Most textbooks date the establishment of the "Publicity Bureau" in 1900 as the start of the modern [[public relations]] (PR) profession. Of course, there were many early forms of public influence and communications management in history. Basil Clarke is considered the founder of the public relations profession in Britain with his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924. Academic Noel Turnball points out that systematic PR was employed in Britain first by religious evangelicals and Victorian reformers, especially opponents of slavery. In each case the early promoters focused on their particular movement and were not for hire more generally.

[[Propaganda]] was used by both sides to rally domestic support and demonize enemies during the First World War. PR activists entered the private sector in the 1920s. Public relations became established first in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe after 1948 when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall plan]].

The second half of the twentieth century was the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the impact of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.

Explorers like [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[kelvin kasiwulaya and Talent Gonsalo]] used exaggerated claims of grandeur to entice settlers to come to the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; For example, in 1598, a desolate swampy area of Virginia was described by Captain [[Arthur Barlowe]] as follows: "The soil is the most plentiful, sweet, fruitful and wholesome of all the world."&lt;ref name="barbara"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Diggs-Brown|title=Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice, 1st ed.: An Audience-focused Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC|date=May 15, 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-63706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antec"/&gt; When colonists wrote back to Europe about the hardships of colonizing [[Virginia]], including the death toll caused by conflicts with Indians, pamphlets with anonymous authors were circulated to reassure potential settlers and rebuke criticisms.&lt;ref name="antec"/&gt;

The first newsletter and the first daily newspaper were founded in Germany in 1609 and 1615 respectively.&lt;ref name="Bernays2013"/&gt; [[Cardinal Richelieu]] of France had pamphlets made that supported his policies and attacked his political opposition.

Author Marvin Olasky said public relations in the 1800s was spontaneous and de-centralized.&lt;ref name="latest"/&gt; In the 1820s, Americans wanted to disprove the perspective of French aristocrats that the American democracy run by "the mob" had "no sense of history, no sense of gratitude to those who had served it, and no sense of the meaning of 'virtue'".

==Origins as a profession==
The book ''Today's Public Relations: An Introduction'' says that, although experts disagree on public relations' origins, many identify the early 1900s as its beginning as a paid profession.&lt;ref name="Heath2006"/&gt; According to Barbara Diggs-Brown, an academic with the [[American University School of Communication]], the PR field anchors its work in historical events in order to improve its perceived validity, but it didn't begin as a professional field until around 1900.&lt;ref name="barbara" /&gt; [[Scott Cutlip]] said, "we somewhat arbitrarily place the beginnings of the public relations vocation with the establishment of The Publicity Bureau in Boston in mid-1900." He explains that the origins of PR cannot be pinpointed to an exact date, because it developed over time through a series of events.&lt;ref name="cutliptwo"/&gt; Most textbooks on public relations say that it was first developed in the United States, before expanding globally;&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=May 22, 2013|date=September 2, 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Jacquie L'Etang, an academic from the United Kingdom, said it was developed in the UK and the US simultaneously.&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"/&gt; Noel Turnball claims it began as a professional field in the 18th and 19th century with British evangelicals and Victorian reformers.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt; According to academic Betteke Van Ruler, PR activities didn't begin in [[Continental Europe]] as a professional field until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="RulerVerčič2004" /&gt;

===Early campaigns===
[[File:Empire Marketing Board poster.jpg|right|thumb|Empire Marketing Board poster.]] Edward Clarke and Bessie Tyler were influential in growing the [[Ku Klux Clan]] to four million members over three years using publicity techniques in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"/&gt; In 1926 the  [[Empire Marketing Board]] was formed by the British government in part to encourage a preference for goods produced in Britain.

[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] were the first Presidents to emphasize the use of publicity.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; In the 1930s Roosevelt used the media to promote [[The New Deal]] and to blame corporations for the country's economic problems. This led companies to recruit their own publicists to defend themselves.&lt;ref name="cutliptwo"/&gt; Roosevelt's anti-trust efforts led corporations to attempt to persuade the public and lawmakers "that bigger [corporations] was not necessarily more evil."&lt;ref name="managementt"/&gt; Wilson used the media to promote his government reform program, [[The New Freedom]].&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; He formed the [[Committee on Public Information]].&lt;ref name="HeathCoombs2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert L.

In the 1930s, the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] was one of the first to create a major campaign promoting capitalism and pro-business viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;Burton St. John III, "Press Professionalization and Propaganda: The Rise of Journalistic Double-Mindedness, 1917–1941." Amherst, NY: Cambria Press, 2010; p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It lobbied against unions, The New Deal and the 8-hour work-day.

In 1938, amid concerns regarding dropping diamond prices and sales volume, [[De Beers]] and its advertising agency N.W. Ayers adopted a strategy to "strengthen the association in the public's mind of diamonds with romance," whereas "the larger and finer the diamond, the greater the expression of love." This became known as one of America's "lexicon of great campaigns" for successfully persuading the public to purchase expensive luxury items during a time of financial stress through [[psychological manipulation]]. It also led to the development of the slogan "A diamond is forever" in 1947 and was influential in how diamonds were marketed thereafter.&lt;ref name="O'Rourke2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=James S.

One week after the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] established the US propaganda agency, the [[Committee on Public Information]] (Creel Commission),&lt;ref name="Ewen2008"/&gt; as an alternative to demands for media censorship by the US army and navy.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; The CPI spread positive messages to present an upbeat image about the war and denied fraudulent atrocities made up to incite anger for the enemy.&lt;ref name = "Image"&gt;{{cite book| last =Creel| first= George| year= 1947| title =Rebel at Large: Recollections of Fifty Crowded Years| publisher= G.P.

As a result of World War I propaganda, there was a shift in PR theory from a focus on factual argumentation to one of emotional appeals and the psychology of the crowd.&lt;ref name="Ewen2008"/&gt; The term "propaganda" which was originally associated with religion and the church, became a more widely known concept.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt;

Propaganda did not develop a negative connotation until it was used in [[Nazi propaganda]] for World War II.&lt;ref name="Welch 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Welch|first=David|title=The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1993|isbn=0-203-93014-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, [[Adolf Hitler]] said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was the main reason for losing the war.&lt;ref name="Welch 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Welch2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Welch|title=Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914–1918: The Sins of Omission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_0od97nsRcC|year=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2798-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf.

According to historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]], broadcasting became the most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air-ship.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

In countries where citizens are subordinate to the government, aggressive propaganda campaigns continued during peace-time, while liberal democratic nations primarily use propaganda techniques to support war efforts.&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

==Professional development==
According to historian Eric Goldman, by the 1940s public relations was being taught at universities and was a professional occupation relied on in a similar way as lawyers and doctors. However, it failed to obtain complete recognition as a profession due in part to a history of deceit.&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; Author Marvin Olasky said in 1987 that the reputation of the profession was getting worse,&lt;ref name="latest"&gt;{{cite book

The number of media outlets increased and PR talent from wartime propaganda entered the private sector.&lt;ref name="Watson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgraw"&gt;{{citation|title=Public Relations: The Profession and the Practice|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073512052/930653/Chapter_2.pdf|publisher=McGraw Hill|accessdate=August 6, 2014|first1=Dan|last1=Lattimore|first2=Otis|last2=Baskin|first3=Suzette|last3=Heiman|first4=Elizabeth|last4=Toth|first5=James|last5=Van Leuven}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of public relations became ubiquitous to reach political, activist and corporate objectives. The development of the press into a more real-time media also led to heightened scrutiny of public relations activities and those they represent. For example, [[Richard Nixon]] was criticized for "doubletalk" and "stonewalling" in his PR office's responses to the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name="managementt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crable|first=Richard|author2=Steven Vibbert|title=Public Relations as Communication Management|publisher=Bellwether Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8087-4878-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade associations were formed first in the U.S. in 1947 with the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA), followed by the Institute of Public Relations (now the [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]]) in London in 1948. Similar trade associations were created in Australia, Europe, South Africa, Italy and Singapore. The International Association of Public Relations was founded in 1955.&lt;ref name="Heath2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated53"/&gt; The Institute for Public Relations held its first conference in 1949 and that same year the first British book on PR, "Public Relations and publicity" was published by J.H.

According to ''The Global Public Relations Handbook'', public relations evolved from a series of "press agents or publicists" to a manner of theory and practice in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="SrirameshVercic2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krishnamurthy Sriramesh|author2=Dejan Vercic|title=The Global Public Relations Handbook, Revised Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOT7RlW1CzoC&amp;pg=PT994|accessdate=July 25, 2013|date=September 10, 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-84554-4|page=994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was published in academic journals like ''Public Relations Review'' and the ''Journal of Public Relations Research''. This led to an industry consensus to categorize PR work into a four-step process: research, planning, communication and action.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt;

==Social and digital==
During the 1990s specialties for communicating to certain audiences and within certain market segments emerged, such as investor relations or technology PR.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt; New internet technology and social media websites effected PR strategies and tactics.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"/&gt; In April 1999, four managers from [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[National Public Radio]] and [[Linux Journal]] created "[[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]." The Manifesto established 95 theses about the way social media and internet technologies were going to change business. It concluded that markets had become "smarter and faster than most companies," because stakeholders were getting information from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Medill Department of Integrated Communications|first=Randy|last=Hlavac|last2=Schaefer|first2=Mark |title=The Social Media Revolution as Theorized by "The Cluetrain Manifesto"|url=http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/02/archives/2013/JIMC_Current_Issue_2013_Article_5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tamar|last=Weinberg|title=The New Community Rules: Marketing on the Social Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wfk_HzC7bS8C&amp;pg=PA63|date=July 1, 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-7928-5|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto "created a storm" with strong detractors and supporters.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Sheldrake|title=The Business of Influence: Reframing Marketing and PR for the Digital Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8xeQR6qatoC|date=May 4, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-97830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Seth Godin]] published a book on [[permission marketing]], which advocated against advertising and in favor of marketing that is useful and educational.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2011"/&gt; While initially controversial, by 2006 it became commonly accepted that social media had an important role in public relations.&lt;ref name="Sheldrake2011"/&gt;

Press releases, which were mostly unchanged for more than a century, began to integrate digital features. [[BusinessWire]] introduced the "Smart News Release," which incorporated audio, video and images, in 1997. This was followed by the MultiVu multimedia release from [[PRNewswire]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="brian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Solis|title=Reviving the Traditional Press Release|url=http://www.briansolis.com/2009/05/reviving-traditional-press-release/|publisher=Brian Solis|date=May 18, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Media Release was created by Todd Defren from [[Shift Communications]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BeB PR: New uses for press releases|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1626924/b2b-pr-new-uses-for-press-releases|newspaper=Fast Company|first=Wendy|last=Marx|date=April 25, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a blog written by journalist and blogger Tom Foremski titled "Die!

According to ''The New York Times'', corporate communications shifted from a monologue to two-way conversational communications&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Elliott|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/business/media/redefining-public-relations-in-the-age-of-social-media.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 29, 2013|title=Redefining Public Relations in the Age of Social Media|date=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new media also made it "easier for consumers to learn about the mix-ups and blunders" of PR.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; For example, after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]], [[British Petroleum|BP]] tried to deflect blame to other parties, claim the spill was not as significant as it was and focused on the science, while human interest stories related to the damage were emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/06/10/10greenwire-bps-pr-blunders-mirror-exxons-appear-destined-98819.html?pagewanted=3|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2013|first=Anne|last=Mulkern|title=BP's PR Blunders Mirror Exxon's, Appear Destined for Record Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Facebook tried to covertly spread privacy concerns about competitor Google's Social Circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook, Foe of Anonymity, is Forced to Explain a Secret|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 13, 2011|first=Miguel|last=Helft|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/technology/14facebook.html|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chapstick]] created a communications crisis after allegedly, repeatedly deleting negative comments on its Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ChapStick Gets Itself in a Social Media Death Spiral|date=October 26, 2011|first=Tim|last=Nudd|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/chapstick-gets-itself-social-media-death-spiral-136097|newspaper=AdWeek|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Iraq War]], it was exposed that the US created false radio personalities to spread pro-American information and paid Iraqi newspapers to write articles written by American troops.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"&gt;{{Citation|last=Schleifer|first=Ron|title=Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq|newspaper=Middle East Quarterly|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShahAnup"&gt;{{citation|last=Shah|first=Anup|title=Iraq War Media Reporting, Journalism and Propaganda|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/461/media-reporting-journalism-and-propaganda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social activism==
Ilian Vassilev has built a reputation as a critic of corruption.

{{World trade}}

''' International trade''' is the exchange of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[goods]], and [[Service (economics)|services]] across [[international borders]] or territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trade|title=Trade – Define Trade at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, such [[trade]] represents a significant share of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). While international trade has existed throughout history (for example [[Uttarapatha]], [[Silk Road]], [[Amber Road]], [[scramble for Africa]], [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[salt road]]s), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries. Carrying out trade at an international level is a more complex process than domestic trade. Trade takes place between two or more nations. Factors like the economy, government policies, markets, laws, judicial system, currency, etc. influence the trade. The political relations between two countries also influences the trade between them. Sometimes, the obstacles in the way of trading affect the mutual relationship adversly. To avoid this, international economic and trade organisations came up. To smoothen and justify the process of trade between countries of different economic standing, some international economic organisations were formed. These organisations work towards the facilitation and growth of international trade.

==Characteristic of global trade==

Trading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products. Almost every kind of product can be found in the international market: food, clothes, spare parts, oil, jewelry, wine, stocks, currencies, and water. Services are also traded: tourism, banking, consulting, and transportation. A product that is transferred or sold from a party in one country to a party in another country is an [[export]] from the originating country, and an [[import]] to the country receiving that product.  Imports and exports are accounted for in a country's current account in the balance of payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp|title=Balance Of Payments (BOP)|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Ancient [[Silk Road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]

[[Industrialization]], advanced technology, including [[transport]]ation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]] are all having a major impact on the international trade system. Increasing international trade is crucial to the continuance of globalization. Nations would be limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders without international trade. International trade is, in principle, not different from [[domestic trade]] as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether trade is across a border or not. The main difference is that international trade is typically more costly than domestic trade. This is due to the fact that a border typically imposes additional costs such as [[tariff]]s, time costs due to border delays, and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system, or culture.

Another difference between domestic and '''international trade''' is that [[factors of production]] such as capital and [[Labour economics|labor]] are typically more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus, international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only to a lesser extent to trade in capital, labour, or other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example of this is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China. Instead of importing Chinese labor, the United States imports goods that were produced with Chinese labor. One report in 2010 suggested that international trade was increased when a country hosted a network of immigrants, but the trade effect was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into their new country.&lt;ref name=twsA36&gt;{{cite news

===Data===

====Official statistics====
Data on the value of exports and imports and their quantities often broken down by detailed lists of products are available in statistical collections on international trade published by the statistical services of intergovernmental and supranational organisations and national statistical institutes. The definitions and methodological concepts applied for the various statistical collections on international trade often differ in terms of definition (e.g. special trade vs. general trade) and coverage (reporting thresholds, inclusion of trade in services, estimates for smuggled goods and cross-border provision of illegal services). Metadata providing information on definitions and methods are often published along with the data.

'''Legal Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance or "LGRC"''', refers to the complex set of processes, rules, tools and systems used by corporate legal departments to adopt, implement and monitor an integrated approach to business problems.
While [[Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance]] refers to a generalized set of tools for managing a corporation or company, Legal GRC, or LGRC, refers to a specialized – but similar – set of [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/ tools]&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R., Mann, G., &amp; Hobbs, V. (2017). ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition''. Paper presented in Valli, C. (Ed.).'' ''The Proceedings of 15th Australian Digital Forensics Conference 5-6 December 2017, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; utilized by attorneys, corporate legal departments, general counsel and law firms to govern themselves and their corporations, especially but not exclusively in relation to the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/techexec/2007/0507techexec1.html Musthaler, Linda and Brian. Governance, risk management and compliance and what it means to you. Network World, March 7, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other specializations within the realm of governance, risk management and compliance include IT GRC and financial GRC. Within these three realms, there is a great deal of overlap, particularly in large corporations that have legal and IT departments, as well as financial departments.

==Legal governance==

'''Legal governance''' refers to the establishment, execution and interpretation of processes and rules put in place by corporate legal departments in order to ensure a smoothly-run legal department and corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dciginc.com/2008/01/interview-with-stephen-whetstone-pt1.html Konkle, Joshua L. Legal risk management requires a corporate strategy, mindset and commitment. DCIG,January 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal risk management==

'''Legal risk management''' refers to the process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory responses to risk and selecting among them. Even with the legal realm, this process requires knowledge of the legal, economic and social factors, as well as knowledge of the business world in which legal teams operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm US Army Corps of Engineers Glossary. August 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132402/http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organizational setting, risk management refers to the process by which an organization sets the risk tolerance, identifies potential risks and prioritizes the tolerance for risk based on the organization’s business objectives, and manages and mitigates risks throughout the organization.

==Legal compliance==

'''Legal compliance''' is the process or procedure to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205103206/http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of legal compliance, especially in the context of corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law.  Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law.
The role of legal compliance has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 Bauer, Christopher. An ethics self-exam: ethical compliances is not just an issue for external review; auditors must look inward to ensure their own integrity is not compromised. Bnet, June 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218141809/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 |date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the LGRC realm, it is important to keep in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of legal compliance be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication.

===Legal Consistency===

'''Legal Consistency''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to be free of contradictions with the law. '''Legal Consistency'''  has been defined as not having multiple verdicts for the same case  &lt;ref&gt;International Law and International Relations: An International  Organization Reader. By Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Contributor Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Edition: illustrated Published by Cambridge University Press, 
2007. {{ISBN|0-521-86186-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86186-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. The antonym '''Legal Inconsistency'''  is defined as having two rule that contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Legisprudence: A New Theoretical Approach to Legislation : Proceedings of the Fourth Benelux-Scandinavian Symposium on Legal Theory By Luc Wintgens Contributor Luc Wintgens Edition: illustrated Published by Hart Publishing, 1998 {{ISBN|1-84113-342-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84113-342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common definitions of consistency refer to “treating  similar cases alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Law and justice in the courts of classical Athens By Adriaan Lanni Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-85759-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the enterprise context, legal consistency  refers to “obedience to the law”.&lt;ref&gt;The Measurement of Moral Judgment By Anne Colby, Lawrence Kohlberg Contributor Lawrence Kohlberg Edition: illustrated Published by CUP Archive, 1987 {{ISBN|0-521-32501-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of legal requirements validation, legal consistency is defined as, " Enterprise requirements are legally consistent if they adhere to the legal requirements and include no contradictions."&lt;ref name="WaelHassan"&gt;Hassan, Waël. PhD Thesis.  University of Ottawa. University of Ottawa Press. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Completeness===

'''Legal Completeness''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to cover all scenarios included or suggested by the law. Completeness suggests that there are no scenarios covered by the law that cannot be implemented in the enterprise.  In addition, it implies that all scenarios not allowed by the law are not allowed by the enterprise.

Enterprise policies are said to be legally complete if they contain no gaps in the legal sense. Completeness can be thought of in two ways:&lt;ref&gt;Armour, J. Share Capital and Creditor Protection: Efficient Rules for a 
Modern Company Law. ESRC Centre for Business Research - Working Papers wp148, ESRC Centre for Business Research. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars make use of a concept of ‘obligational’ completeness such as Ayres and Gertner.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, Ian and Gertner, Robert (1992), ‘Strategic Contractual Inefficiency and the Optimal Choice of Legal Rules’, 101 Yale Law Journal 729&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to this usage, a system or a contract is ‘obligationally’ complete if it specifies what each party is to do in every situation, even if this is not the optimal action to take under some circumstances. Others discuss ‘enforceability’ completeness in the sense that failing to specify key terms can lead a court to characterize a system as being too uncertain to enforce (May &amp; Butcher v the King 1934),&lt;ref&gt;Cases and Materials on Contracts By S. M. Waddams, Waddams, S. M., 1942-, Waddams, Trebilcock, mccamus, Neyers, Waldron Edition: 3 Published by Emond  Montgomery Publication, 2005 {{ISBN|1-55239-166-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55239-166-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence a system may be complete with respect to enforceability. This leads to the following definition: enterprise regulations or requirements are legally complete if it specifies what each party is to do in each situation while covering all gaps in the legal sense.&lt;ref name="WaelHassan" /&gt;

==History==

Lebogang says.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110530070924/http://220.72.21.21/pub/docu/kr/AA/04/AA042007SAF/AA04-2007-SAF-001.PDF Kim, Won-Kyu. The effect of industrial restructuring policy post-financial crisis. September/October 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] act, legal industry [[thought leaders]] saw a need for a new framework for legal GRC, and borrowed heavily from IT, RIM and other industries to try to come up with new, clear processes and rules to make navigating the choppy waters of the post-financial crisis legal world go as smoothly as possible.

==Organizations==

===Legal GRC Center for Innovation===

The Legal GRC Center for Innovation is a nonprofit institute for the advancement of the concepts and applications of Legal GRC. The LGRC Center for Innovation serves as a forum for legal industry leaders to discuss and determine ways to systematize and streamline within the legal industry. The membership of the LGRC-CFI is made up of a group of [thought leaders] in the legal, business, IT, and RIM fields. They meet in online forums and at periodic conventions and summits to determine [[best practices]] for Legal GRC. The LGRC-CFI also publishes a [[blog]] and several industry-specific [[white papers]] regularly. The LGRC Center for Innovation addresses legal governance, risk management, and compliance exclusively.

===Institute on Governance===

The [[Institute on Governance]] (IOG), although it does not address LGRC exclusively, is a useful resource for knowledge on governance in general, and has collected some significant basics about legal governance online.
The IOG is an independent, Canadian, nonprofit [think tank] founded in 1990 to promote better governance for public benefit. Through our research and services we help public organizations and societies realize their objectives by putting [[good governance]] into practice.

===Association of Corporate Counsel===

The [[Association of Corporate Counsel]] ("ACC"), formerly the American Corporate Counsel Association ("ACCA"), is an association of in-house counsel, [[Lawyer|attorneys]] who work for [[corporations]]. The association publishes the magazine ACC Docket and arranges one of the United States’ largest annual meetings for in-house attorneys. ACC was founded in 1982. It currently has more than 24,000 members from over 10,500 corporations in 77 countries.[1]
The ACC does not address LGRC exclusively, but can be credited with laying some foundations for corporations – the original practitioners of governance, risk management, and compliance – and legal departments to begin to work together on overarching issues of governance, risk management, and compliance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">A '''legal nurse consultant''' ('''LNC''') is a [[registered nurse]] who uses expertise as a [[health care provider]] and specialized [[training]] to consult on medical-related [[legal case]]s. LNCs assist [[Lawyer|attorneys]] in reading [[medical record]]s and understanding medical terminology and [[healthcare]] issues to achieve the best results for their clients.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/?page=WhatisanLNC "What is an LNC?"] on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt;  The specialty is a relatively recent one, beginning in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

A legal nurse consultant bridges gaps in an attorney's knowledge. While the attorney is an expert on legal issues, the LNC is an expert on [[nursing]] and the health care system. LNCs screen cases for merit, assist with [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]; conduct the existing literature and [[Biomedical research|medical research]]; review medical records; identify [[Standard of care|standards of care]]; prepare reports and summaries on the extent of injury or illness; create [[demonstrative evidence]]; and locate or act as [[expert witness]]es. The legal nurse consultant acts as a specialized member of the [[litigation]] team whose professional contributions are often critical to achieving a fair and just outcome for all parties.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt;

A legal nurse consultant differs from a [[paralegal]] in that a paralegal assists attorneys in the delivery of legal services and frequently requires a [[legal education]], while a legal nurse consultant is first and foremost a practictioner of nursing, and legal education is not necessarily a prerequisite. A legal nurse consultant uses existing expertise as a health care professional to consult and educate clients on specific medical and nursing issues in their cases.

Aside from within law firms, LNCs may also be found working for government agencies, insurance companies and [[HMO]]s, in hospitals as part of the [[risk management]] department, and may also be in independent practice.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt;

The [[American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants]] (AALNC), which was founded in 1989, is a non-profit membership organization whose mission is to promote legal nurse consulting as a nursing speciality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/?page=MissionStatement "Mission and Goals"] on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt;  The Association also promulgates a Code of Ethics for the Legal Nurse Consultant practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/resource/resmgr/becoming_a_lnc_page/codeofethicsupdated2009final.pdf "Codes of Ethics"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on the AALNC website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2001, the Association had approximately 4,000 members, the majority of whom had joined after 1994.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

There are a number of training courses and [[certification]]s available for LNCs. The American Legal Nurse Consultant Certification Board offers an online examination which is the only LNC certification exam credited by the [[American Board of Nursing Specialties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalnc.org/page/LNCC/?

'''Managerial psychology''' is a sub-discipline of industrial and organizational [[psychology]], which focuses on the efficacy of individuals, groups and organizations in the [[workplace]]. Its purpose is to specifically aid [[Management|managers]] in gaining a better understanding of the psychological patterns common among individuals and groups within any given organisation. Managerial psychology can be used to predict and prevent harmful psychological patterns within the workplace and can also be implemented to control psychological patterns among individuals and groups in a way that will benefit the organisation long term. (Robbins, SP et al.2010).

== Managerial psychologists ==
If in the early stages managerial psychologists used to study the problems of fatigue, boredom, and other working conditions that could impede efficient work performance. More recently, their contributions have expanded to include [[learning]], [[perception]], [[personality]], [[emotion]]s, training, leadership, effectiveness, needs and motivational forces, job satisfaction, decision-making processes, performance appraisals, attitude measurement, employee-selection techniques, work design, and job stress(Robbins, SP et al.2010). This means that they apply psychology principles to the workplace and use their skills to study workplace productivity, morale, employee screening or organizational development. Apart from this, they can also train and screen job applicants, assist with organizational development, and consult with corporations on a problem-solving basis.

== Objectives ==
* To understand how to manage stress, change and personal problems
* To understand how to work with a diverse group of people
* To understand how to conduct conflict resolution and the importance of effective confrontation skills
* To understand the importance of ethics in the workplace
* To identify effective leadership styles and the importance of leadership and what makes someone a successful leader
* To learn how to identify skills, motivate, develop and persuade others.

== Personality, motivation and job satisfaction ==
Herzberg et al.’s (1959) seminal [[Two-factor theory|two-factor theory of motivation]] theorized that satisfaction and dissatisfaction were not two opposite extremes of the same sequence, but two separate entities caused by quite different facets of work – these were labelled as “hygiene factors” and “motivators”. Hygiene factors are characterized as extrinsic components of job design that contribute to employee dissatisfaction if they are not met. Examples include: supervision, working conditions, company policies, salary, and relations with co-workers. Motivators, however, are intrinsic to the job itself and include aspects such as achievement, development, responsibility and recognition. On the other hand, intrinsic factors have long been acknowledged as important determinants of motivation. There is a longstanding debate as to whether hygiene factors really contribute to job satisfaction (Furnham et al., 1999; Warr, 1987). Most job satisfaction and motivation research literature is concerned with organisational or situational predictors (such as pay and supervision) (Locke, 1976) while neglecting individual differences (Staw and Ross, 1985). O’Reilly et al. (1980) discovered that individuals’ significantly differ in the way they perceive their jobs, even if the job description and the tasks they had to perform remained constant, thus suggesting that some individual differences must have an effect on work attitudes.

Staw et al. (1986) argued that individual disposition may have a profound influence over how the working world is perceived (i.e. what is important to the individual), and this is likely to affect the type of jobs that are sought.

=== The ten item personality inventory ===
It was first introduced in Gosling et al., (2003) and the ten items of this measure are scored using a seven-point scale, with two statements (one reversed) used to measure each personality variable. The authors report extensive data showing good reliability and validity of this instrument.

=== The work values questionnaire (WVQ) ===
This inventory introduced in Furnham et al., (2005) consists of 37 items and requires individuals to report the extent to which intrinsic (e.g.responsibility and personal growth) and extrinsic (e.g. pay and benefits) components are important to them on a six-point scale. The WVQ is a revised version of Mantech’s(1983) questionnaire. Previous studies have indicated that between two and four factors tend to be extracted, and that these often correspond to Herzberg et al.’s (1959) hygiene and motivator factors .

=== The job satisfaction scale ===
This scale introduced in Warr et al., (1979) consists of 15 items, seven of which measure intrinsic satisfaction, whilst the remaining eight measure extrinsic job satisfaction. Responses are given on a seven-point scale and can be summed to create and overall satisfaction score as well as an intrinsic and extrinsic value.

=== Experiment on personality, motivation and job satisfaction ===
In a recent issue of Journal of Managerial Psychology published in 2009 is presented an experiment with 202 full-time employees (81 males, mean age=38.3 and 121 females, mean age= 28.4) working in very different jobs in the retail, manufacturing and healthcare to investigate the extent to which personality and demographic factors explain variance in motivation and job satisfaction as defined by Herzberg et al.’s (1959) two-factor theory. Every person was given 3 questionnaires ( The ten item personality inventory, The work values questionnaire (WVQ), The job satisfaction scale) and had to complete them via a website.

As predicted, personality and demographic variables were significant correlates of the extracted factors, accounting for between 9 and 15.2 per cent of the variance. Similarly, personality and demographic variables were also significantly related to all three job satisfaction scores and accounted for between 10.5 and 12.7 per cent of the variance. As expected, conscientiousness was a significant correlate of job satisfaction scores in both correlational and regressional analyses. Contrary to expectations, age, job tenure and years working full-time were not significantly related to job satisfaction scores; however, in line with predictions and the two-factor theory, job status was significantly associated with these scores.

Negative relationships were observed between the security and conditions factor and job status, as well as years in full-time employment. These results suggest that individuals with low job status (e.g. graduate positions and non-managerial roles) are more concerned with working conditions and clarity in their work than those of a higher status and individuals who have been working for longer periods.

These results further validate the contention that work attitudes are not the product of situational factors alone, and that both literature and organisations should further investigate the variables that contribute to these values with the intention of increasing job satisfaction and performance, through effective selection methods and pervasive job interventions.

== Tools used by managerial psychologists ==

=== Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs===
[[File:Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs_Pyramid.png|thumb|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]

[[Abraham Maslow]] developed the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Hierarchy of Needs]] model in 1940-50s USA, and the Hierarchy of Needs theory remains valid today for understanding human motivation, management training, and personal development. Maslow's ideas surrounding the Hierarchy of Needs concern the responsibility of employers to provide a workplace environment that encourages and enables employees to fulfill their own unique potential (self-actualization).

While Maslow referred to various additional aspects of motivation, he expressed the Hierarchy of Needs in these five clear stages.

*'''Biological and Physiological needs''' - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep, etc.
*'''Safety needs''' - protection from elements, security, order, law, limits, stability, etc.
*'''Belongingness and Love needs''' - work group, family, affection, relationships, etc.
*'''Esteem needs''' - self-esteem, achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, managerial responsibility, etc.
*'''Self-Actualization needs''' - realising personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.

=== Douglas McGregor's XY Theory ===

[[Douglas McGregor]], an American social psychologist, proposed his famous X-Y theory in his 1960 book 'The Human Side Of Enterprise'. [[Theory X and Theory Y]] are still referred to commonly in the field of management and motivation. McGregor's ideas suggest that there are two fundamental approaches to managing people. Many managers tend towards theory x, and generally get poor results. Enlightened managers use theory y, which produces better performance and results, and allows people to grow and develop.

==== Theory x ('authoritarian management' style)      ====
* The average person dislikes work and will avoid it he/she can.
* Therefore, most people must be forced with the threat of punishment to work towards organisational objectives.
* The average person prefers to be directed; to avoid responsibility; is relatively unambitious, and wants security above all else.

==== Theory y ('participative management' style) ====
* Effort in work is as natural as work and play.
* People will apply self-control and self-direction in the pursuit of organisational objectives, without external control or the threat of punishment.
* Commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with their achievement.
* People usually accept and often seek responsibility.
* The capacity to use a high degree of imagination, ingenuity and creativity in solving organisational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.
* In industry the intellectual potential of the average person is only partly utilised.

=== McClelland's Human Motivation Theory      ===
'''''See also''''' [[Need theory]]

[[David McClelland]] in his 1961 book, "The Achieving Society " identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. According to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).

McClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.

==== Achievement ====
People motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.

When providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.

==== Affiliation ====
People motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.

When providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.

==== Power ====
Those with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations  or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.

When providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals

{{Nihongo|'''Nozomu Matsumoto'''|松本望|Matsumoto Nozomu|extra= May 2, 1905 – July 15, 1988}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[businessman]] and inventor who founded [[Pioneer Corporation]]. He was born in [[Kobe]], Japan in 1905, the son of a Christian missionary. In 1936, he founded the Fukuin Shokai Denki Seisakusho company in Osaka, whose name roughly translates to "Blessed Sound Electric Company" or "Gospel Electric Company", owing to Matsumoto's Christian faith and belief that his electronic products could help in missionary works. In 1937 he created the A-8 speaker which he christened 'Pioneer'. Matsumoto relocated to [[Tokyo]] in 1938 and started a small factory which repaired radios and speakers. After the war the company expanded rapidly.

His son, Seiya Matsumoto graduated the Chuo Universiteit and joined his fathers company as head of sales and marketing until he became president of the company in 1982.  The brother of Seiya, Kanya Matsumoto was very technical, just as his father.  When he joined the company, he was responsible for technical and productive aspects in the company.
In 1961 the name 'Pioneer' was changed to 'Pioneer Electronic Corporation' and it was listed on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. Nozomu Matsumoto died in 1988 at the age of 83.

'''Paulista Avenue''' ('''Avenida Paulista''' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Paulista'' being the [[gentilic]] for those born in [[State of São Paulo|São Paulo]] state) is one of the most important avenues in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; It stretches {{convert|2.8|km|mi}}  and runs northwest to southeast. Its northwest point is [[Praça Marechal Cordeiro de Farias]] at its intersection with [[Rua da Consolação]] and its southeast point is [[Praça Oswaldo Cruz]] at its intersection with Treze de Maio, Bernardino de Campos, Desembargador Eliseu Guilherme, and Dr. Rafael de Barros avenues. Major crossroads on the street are [[Rua Augusta]], [[Rua Haddock Lobo]] and [[Avenida Brigadeiro Luis Antonio]]. Parallel to it are Cincinato Braga, Joaquim Eugenio de Lima on the Bela Vista/Paraíso side and Alameda Santos and Coronel [[Rua Oscar Freire|Oscar Freire]] on the Jardins side. Paulista Avenue crosses sections of the neighborhoods of [[Paraíso, São Paulo|Paraíso]], [[Bela Vista (district of São Paulo)|Bela Vista]], [[Jardim Paulista]], Cerqueira César and Jardim América, ending in [[Higienópolis, São Paulo|Higienópolis]].

The headquarters of a large number of financial and cultural institutions are located on Paulista Avenue. As a symbol of the center of economic and political power of São Paulo it has been the focal point of numerous political protests beginning in 1929 and continuing into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt; It is also home to an extensive shopping area and to South America's most comprehensive [[Art museum|fine-art museum]], [[São Paulo Museum of Art|MASP]]. Being one of the highest points in São Paulo, it is clustered with radio and TV stations [[Antenna (radio)|antennae]], most notably that of [[Rede Gazeta]]. Paulista Avenue is a major hub of the subway and bus lines of the city.

==Overview==
[[File:Martin, Jules - Avenida Paulista no dia da Inauguração, 8 de Dezembro de 1891, Acervo do Museu Paulista da USP (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|First painting of Avenida Paulista, by Martin Jules.]]

===Construction===

Paulista Avenue was constructed in 1891 by [[Joaquim Eugênio de Lima]] (1845-1902), a Uruguayan-Brazilian civil engineer.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; Once a residential neighbourhood thoroughfare flanked by lavishly ornate mansions with Arabesque and European themes of the city's coffee barons and industry entrepreneurs such as the Matarazzo family. Paulista Avenue Number One belonged to the Von Bülow family, founders and operators of the [[Companhia Antarctica Paulista|Antarctica]] brewery. It became the first paved street in São Paulo in 1909. [[Asphalt]] was imported from Germany to complete the project.

A master plan for the avenue titled ''Plano de Avenida'' was devised by Mayor [[Francisco Prestes Maia]] in 1930 during the regime of President [[Getúlio Vargas]]. It was based on [[David Burnham]]'s master plan for [[Chicago]], and attempted to control urban growth of São Paulo. The plan promoted the decentralization of urban areas, development of automobile routes, and construction low-cost and high-density housing.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt; The first multi-story building on the avenue was a seven-story structure at the corner of Paulista and Frei Caneca constructed in 1939. The most important of the ones which still stand to this day is [[Casa das Rosas]], near Praça Osvaldo Cruz in the very beginning of the long avenue. It was turned into a cultural center in the late 1980s. The house has oil/hydraulic heat radiators, a luxury only the millionaire could afford.

===Modernization===
[[File:Paulista Avenue at night, São Paulo, Brazil.jpg|thumb|Avenida Paulista at night.]]
Paulista Avenue underwent a massive renovation and verticalization beginning in the 1950s, a trend that followed president [[Juscelino Kubitschek]]'s vision of a rapid economic expansion of Brazil. Developers pressured legislators to allow for the removal of Neo-Classic, Hindu-style and Middle Eastern structures along the street. These and other buildings were torn down overnight to avoid popular resistance.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt; The avenue became home to financial institutions and a symbol of the economic power of [[São Paulo (state)|State of São Paulo]]. The concentration of commerce on Paulista Avenue in the 1950s attracted a new population of middle class residents in the area, both at the expense of the city's historic downtown area. The change in economic, social, and cultural status of São Paulo, as exemplified by Paulista Avenue, attracted migration from poorer areas of Brazil and the subsequent appearance of [[favela]]s at the perimeter of the city.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt;

Paulista Avenue again underwent significant structural renovation in 1972 The "Novo Paulista" master plan of Mayor [[José Vicente Faria Lima]] tripled the vehicle capacity from 20,000 vehicles per day to more than 100,000 at present. All trees along the avenue, numbering 182 on the right and 140 on the left, were declared eyesores and removed to accommodate the increase in transportation routes. Current trees on the avenue, which number 390, are the result of replanting between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="aventuras"/&gt;

It is estimated that more than 800,000 commuters transit Avenida Paulista daily. The avenue is served by the city's subway system, with the [[Line 2 (São Paulo Metro)|Line 2 (Green Line)]] of the ''Metrô'' (São Paulo's [[São Paulo Metro|Metro]] system) running  underneath the avenue from one end to the other. This line connects the East and West sides of the metropolis having transfers to the [[Line 1 (São Paulo Metro)|Line 1 (Blue Line)]], the [[Line 4 (São Paulo Metro)|Line 4 (Yellow Line)]], the Subway Line 5 (Lilac Line) to the south side, the train Line 10 (Turquoise Line) and the monorail line 15 (Silver Line).

Paulista is home to a small native forest park, the Parque Siqueira Campos, commonly called ''Trianon'', and to the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] (MASP - Museu de Arte de São Paulo). MASP is known not only for its excellent collection of European and national paintings, sketches, and sculptures by Renoir, Picasso and Modernist Brazilian authors, but also for the modern architecture of its building, whose exhibition room is made of a single block of concrete and glass windows suspended and supported by two vertical concrete columns so the view of 9 de Julho Avenue and the Cantareira mountain range north of here is not spoiled. The empty space or vault covered by cobblestones is used by the Feira de Antiguidade—Antique fair—every Sunday, open movie projections and other cultural and public events. Dedicated in 1968 by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], MASP is, due to conformity, a city landmark.

The [[São Paulo Gay Pride Parade]] in May/June, the largest in the world, and the [[Saint Silvester Road Race]] on [[New Year's Eve]] take place on this avenue yearly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athosgls.com.br/noticias_visualiza.php?contcod=29447 Investments of the City Hall of São Paulo – LGBT Parade]&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrations of local soccer teams and World Cup championships and political demonstrations also have Paulista as a stage.

[[Image:MASP_Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|[[São Paulo Museum of Art]], one of the city's most controversial architectural landmarks]]

The avenue is also renowned for excellent private schools such as Maria Imaculada school for girls; the Anglican Saint Paul's school; Dante Alighieri private school, Alumni English Language Institute, São Luis University and School, Casa di Cultura Italiana, and Objetivo Preparatory School. The Rodrigues Alves public school, in front of Hospital Santa Catarina, is housed in a yellow neo-classic building.

Numerous cultural centers line Paulista Avenue. [[Centro Cultural Itaú]] near Casa das Rosas in Paraiso, is an exhibition space; [[Centro Cultural FIESP/CIESP]] is an exhibition space of arts and crafts. Centro Cultural FIESP/CIESP also  houses the [[Teatro Brasileiro de Comedia]], which distributes free tickets for its weekly performances. Some of the São Paulo's best hospitals are located in the Paulista Avenue area; they include Hospital Alemão Osvaldo Cruz, Paulistano, Clínicas, Emilio Ribas and Beneficência Portuguesa. Large-scale shopping malls on the street, some of which are now designated historic buildings, include Center Três, Conjunto Nacional, Grande Avenida, Gazeta, Top Center and Shopping Pátio Paulista. They are noted for their coffee shops, internet facilities, restaurants, luncheonettes, shops, and movie theaters. Some of the remaining historic mansions and banks are decorated during the [[Christmas]] season, and draw crowds for picture taking.

'''Pierantonio Costa''' (1939 - living) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[businessman]], [[diplomat]] and a [[rescuer]] of many lives during the [[Rwandan genocide]]. 

He was born in Mestre on 7 May 1939 as the fifth of seven children. At age 15 he joined his father who had emigrated to [[Zaire]]. He had his first experience of African wars in 1960 in [[Bukavu]], where he successfully transported groups of Congolese [[refugees]] across Lake Kivu. After a revolt called the [[Simba Rebellion]] broke out, he moved to newly independent [[Rwanda]] where he lived until 1994. Today he divides himself between Kigali and Brussels.

During the [[Rwandan genocide]], Pierantonio Costa was the Italian Consul in Kigali. From 6 April to 21 July 1994, Costa first saved Italians and Westerners, then he moved to his brother's property in [[Burundi]] and from there he travelled a lot across Rwanda in an unfaltering effort to rescue the people. For this purpose he used his diplomatic role, his network of friendships and acquaintances and his own money (more than 3 million dollars) to get exit permits for those who asked him for help. 

By the end of the genocide he had rescued 2,000 people, including 375 children. 

He was awarded a gold medal for civil value by the Italian government and received a similar decoration from the Belgian authorities.

This is how he described his deeds: “In the midst of so much violence and suffering, I just did what I had to do. That’s all”. 

His story was recorded by journalist Luciano Scalettari, who said:” In my opinion, he is a [[righteous]] man, in the sense that the Jews attribute to this term”. Pierantonio Costa replied: ”I only answered the voice of my conscience. When there is something that has to be done, you just get on with it”.

A '''Portfolio Manager''' is a professional responsible for making [[investment]] decisions and carrying out investment activities on behalf of vested individuals or institutions. The investors invest their money into the portfolio manager's [[Investment policy statement|investment policy]] for future fund growth such as a [[Pension fund|retirement fund]], [[Financial endowment|endowment fund]], education fund and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CFA Institute Level I: Corporate Finance &amp; Portfolio Management|last=Conroy|first=Robert M.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portfolio managers work with a team of analysts and researchers, and are responsible for establishing an investment [[strategy]], selecting appropriate investments and allocating each investment properly towards an [[investment fund]] or [[asset management]] vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanagement.asp|title=Portfolio Management|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==
In th 1950s, [[Harry Markowitz|Harry Markovitz]], an American economist, developed the [[Capital asset pricing model|Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CAPM), which is one of the primary portfolio management tool. The CAPM formula calculates the potential return percentage of an investment vehicle based on its vested risk appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/university/concepts/concepts8.asp|title=Financial Concepts: Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)|date=2003-11-30|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://capital.com/portfolio-management-definition|title=What is Portfolio Management|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula is:

er = rf + β (rm - rf), where

* er = expected returns
*rf = risk free rate
* rm = expected market returns
* β = risk measure

== Investors ==
The goal of an investment manager is to earn a greater return than the given level of [[Risk management|risk]]. This return can be monitored by investors through weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly performance reports shared by the portfolio manager. The manager may setup a performance benchmark or track their investment strategy alongside an index. The investment policy shared by the manager outlines the details such as minimum investment requirements, liquidity provisions, investment strategy and markets the manager will be actively investing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp|title=Investment Manager|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-05-30|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Institutional investors include [[Fund of hedge funds|Fund of Hedge Funds]], [[Insurance companies]], [[Endowment fund|Endowment]] funds and [[Sovereign wealth fund|Sovereign Wealth]] funds. Individual investors include [[Ultra high-net-worth individual|Ultra-High Net Worth Individuals]] (UHNW) or [[High-net-worth individual|High Net Worth Individuals]] (HNW). 

== Portfolio Managers &amp; Investment Analysts ==
Portfolio managers are presented with investment ideas from internal buy-side [[business analyst|analyst]]s and sell-side analysts from [[investment bank]]s. It is their job to sift through the relevant information and use their judgment to buy and sell [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Throughout the day, they read reports, talk to company managers and monitor [[industry]] and [[Economics|economic]] trends looking for the right company and time to invest the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio's]] [[Financial capital|capital]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.bcci.bg/projects/latvia/pdf/8_IAPM_final.pdf Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of analysts and researchers are ultimately responsible for establishing an investment [[strategy]], selecting appropriate investments and allocating each investment properly for a fund or asset-management vehicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Portfolio managers make decisions about investment mix and policy, matching investments to objectives, asset allocation for individuals and institutions, and balancing risk against performance. Portfolio management is about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the choice of debt vs. equity, domestic vs. international, growth vs. safety, and other trade offs encountered in the attempt to maximize return at a given appetite for risk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the case of mutual and [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs), there are two forms of portfolio management: passive and active. [[Passive management]] simply tracks a market index, commonly referred to as indexing or index investing. Active management involves a single manager, co-managers, or a team of managers who attempt to beat the market return by actively managing a fund's portfolio through investment decisions based on research and decisions on individual holdings. [[Closed-end fund]]s are generally actively managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/21036-active-vs-passive-the-case-for-and-against-index-funds.html|title=Active Vs. Passive: The Case For And Against Index Funds {{!}} ETF.com|website=www.etf.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Systems ==
The IT Infrastructure for a portfolio manager facilitates the delivery of updated prices and market information to allow for trade orders, trade executions and their overall portfolio value. The IT infrastructure, known as a portfolio management system (PMS), include components such as an [[order management system]], [[execution management system]], portfolio valuation, risk and compliance. A front-back PMS will also include a [[middle office]] and [[back office]] components such as trade management, pre/post-trade tools, cash management and Net asset value calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/money-you/how-to-pick-a-portfolio-management-scheme/articleshow/7746114.cms|title=How to pick a portfolio management scheme|date=2011-03-20|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Producer's risk''' is the [[probability]] that a good [[product (business)|product]] will be rejected as a bad product by the [[consumer]]. Or rejecting the lot of satisfactory quality is a risk faced by any producer, the probability of rejecting a lot under the sampling inspection plan is called '''Producer's risk'''. 

When the acceptance reliability level (ARL) is pi0, we can define the producer's risk as:
P(Test is Failed|pi0)

It calculates the probability of loss from (1) rejecting a batch which, in fact, should have been accepted, or (2) accepting a batch that, in fact, will be rejected by the customer. As in Hypothesis testing when a null hypothesis is rejected when it is true.
It is also called Type I error or Alfa error.

A '''record press''' is a machine for manufacturing [[vinyl records]]. It is essentially a [[hydraulic press]] fitted with thin [[nickel]] stampers which are negative impressions of a master disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making it in the new music business |last=Riordan |first=James |year=1991 |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |page=233 |isbn=0898794587 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labels and a pre-heated vinyl patty (or "biscuit") are placed in a heated mold cavity. Two stampers are used, one for each of side of the disc. The record press closes under a pressure of about 150 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L38MrvScG3gC&amp;pg=PA271 |page=271 |title=The Audio Dictionary |first1=Glenn |last1=White |first2=Gary J. |last2=Louie |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=2005 |isbn=0295801700}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[compression molding]] forces the hot vinyl to fill the grooves in the stampers, and take the form of the finished record.

In the mid-1960s, Emory Cook developed a system of record forming wherein the mold pressure was replaced by a [[vacuum]]. In this technique, the mold cavity was evacuated and vinyl was introduced in micro-particle form. The particles were then flash-fused instantaneously at a high temperature forming a coherent solid.  Cook called this disc manufacturing technology "microfusion". A small pressing plant in Hollywood also employed a similar system which they maintained fused the particles more evenly throughout the disc thickness calling their product "polymax".  Both claimed the resultant disc grooves exhibited less surface noise and greater resistance to deformation from stylus tip inertia than convention pressure molded vinyl discs.

'''Serving suggestion''' is a [[disclaimer]] used on [[food packaging]]. The phrase is used as legal [[fine print]] with a picture of the product.  The picture attempts to portray the manufacturer's food in the most favorable or appetizing way possible, sometimes including other foods that the package does not contain. For example, the labeling on a box of [[cereal]] may feature a picture of a cereal bowl filled with that cereal, milk and a fruit [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], or a jar of [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] may picture a [[hot dog]] in a bun with mustard on it. The serving suggestion may portray the [[serving size]] of the food used, but just as often a much larger serving is shown as part of the [[marketing]] of the item. As a disclaimer a serving suggestion also serves to remove any legal obligation on the part of the manufacturer to provide the other items pictured with their product.
In Ireland this is an illegal practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''substantial shareholdings exemption''' is an [[tax exemption|exemption]] from assessment of [[capital gains]] under [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]] applicable to [[United Kingdom]] [[companies]]. The exemption is found in Schedule 7AC of the [[Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992]].

The rationale for the exemption is that groups of companies should be able to [[restructuring|restructure]] without having to concern themselves with [[taxation]] of [[capital gains]].

Other European jurisdictions apply a more comprehensive system. For example, in Luxembourg and the Netherlands as well as in Germany and Belgium, both capital gains derived from, as well as dividend income earned on, qualifying shares are (mostly) exempt from further local taxation. These comprehensive systems are generally referred to as [[participation exemption]] systems.

== Eligibility ==

To qualify for the exemption, a disposal must meet all of the following criteria:

* The disposing company must dispose of [[Stock|shares]] or an interest in shares of another company.&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The company must have held a "substantial shareholding" in the other company for a continuous period of at least 12 months in the preceding two years.&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 7&lt;/ref&gt; This will be extended to the preceding six years for disposals on or after 1 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Bill 2017-19, clause 27(3)&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial shareholding means a shareholding in respect of which the following conditions are met:
** The disposing company holds at least 10% of the [[Common stock|ordinary share capital]] of the other company;&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 8(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;
** The disposing company is entitled to at least 10% of [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] available for distribution;&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 8(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; and
** The disposing company would be entitled to at least 10% of the other company's [[asset]]s on a [[liquidation]].&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 8(1)(c)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disposing company must be a trading company or a member of a trading group.&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 18&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement does not apply for disposals on or after 1 April 2017&lt;ref&gt;Finance Bill 2017-19, clause 27(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The target company (or the company whose shares are being disposed of) must be a trading company or the holding company of a trading group.&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The last two conditions must be met:
* throughout the period:
** beginning at the same time as the 12-month period referred to in the first condition begins, and
** ending at the time of the disposal;&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 18(1)(a) and para 19(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; and
* immediately after the disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, Schedule 7AC, para 18(1)(b) and para 19(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability ==

The exemption only applies to disposals of shares made on or after 1 April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 2002, section 44(3)&lt;/ref&gt; The relief is automatic, meaning that a company does not have to submit a claim to [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]].

'''Sustainability marketing myopia''' is a term used in [[sustainability marketing]] referring to a distortion stemming from the overlooking of socio-environmental attributes of a [[Sustainable product development|sustainable product]] or service at the expenses of customer benefits and values.{{sfn|Belz|2010|}} The idea of sustainability marketing myopia is rooted into conventional [[Marketing myopia|marketing myopia theory]], as well as [[green marketing]] myopia.

== Background ==

=== Marketing myopia ===
The marketing myopia theory was originally proposed in 1960 by American economist [[Theodore Levitt]]. According to Levitt marketers should not overlook the importance of company potential and product attributes at the expenses of market needs; catering for market needs should receive first priority.{{sfn|Levitt|1960|}}

A company, besides being technically sound and product oriented, also needs to be customer oriented in order to successfully cater for a market. Knowledge of customer needs and of innovations that can be implemented to maintain customer interest, as well as of how to adapt to the changing business market is crucial.

Marketing myopia has been highly influential in the formation of modern marketing theory, and was heeded by marketers to such an extent that some authors now speak of a “new marketing myopia” stemming from too narrow a focus on customer to the exclusion of other stakeholders.{{sfn|Smith et al.|2009|}}

=== Green marketing myopia ===
Green marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally safe.{{sfn|GMI|}} In order to be successful, green marketing must fulfill two objectives: improved environmental quality and customer satisfaction. Misjudging either or overemphasizing the former at the expense of the latter can be defined as green marketing myopia.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=24}}

The marketing discipline has long argued that innovation must consider an intimate understanding of the customer{{sfn|Levitt|1960|}} and a close look at green marketing practices over time reveals that green products must be positioned on a consumer value sought by targeted consumers.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=24}}

As such, successful green products are able to appeal to mainstream consumers or lucrative market niches and frequently command price premiums by offering “non-green” consumer value (such as convenience and performance). When consumers are convinced of the desirable “non-green” benefits of environmental products, they are more inclined to adopt them.

Aside from offering environmental benefits that do not meet consumer preferences, green marketing myopia can also occur when green products fail to provide credible, substantive environmental benefits.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=25}}

== Towards sustainability ==

=== Sustainability marketing myopia ===
Sustainability marketing aims at marketing sustainable products and services which “satisfy customer needs and significantly improve the social and environmental performance along the whole life cycle”,{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=154}} while increasing customer value and achieving the company's objectives. In turns, sustainability marketing myopia is an exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological attributes of the product over the core consumer values, a distortion of the marketing process which is likely to lead to the product failing on the market or remaining confined in a small alternative niche.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=153}}

Just as an excessive focus on product attributes generates marketing myopia, and just as a single-minded focus on customers results in “new marketing myopia”, in both green and sustainability marketing  an unbalanced strategy neglecting one aspect (namely, product attributes) is detrimental to the effectiveness of the marketing process.

However, it is important to note that sustainability marketing myopia differs from green marketing myopia in that the former follows a broader approach to the marketing myopia issue, taking into account the social attributes of a product, as well as the environmental ones. At the same time, sustainability marketing myopia encompasses sustainable services and product-related services,{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=159}} not products alone.

=== Avoiding sustainability marketing myopia ===
Generally, sustainability marketing myopia can be avoided in two ways:

* by identifying and stressing the inherent consumer’s values (efficiency and cost-effectiveness, health and safety, convenience, symbolism and status) of the socio-ecological features of the product. In other words, companies should highlight the personal customer benefits stemming from the socio-ecological features of the product;
* by aligning socio-ecological attributes with core benefits of the product to create “motive alliances”.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|pp=164-167}} Core benefits of the product can comprise functionality, performance, design, durability, taste, freshness, uniqueness, aesthetics, fashion. Motive alliances are the connections of such core benefits with the relevant socio-ecological attributes embedded in the product, an operation also known as [[Product bundling|bundling]].{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=30}}

[[Jacquelyn Ottman|Ottman]] et al.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=32}} provides examples of successful marketing communications based on the highlighting of inherent consumer’s values of the socio-ecological features of products, and on bundling:

* “The only thing our washer will shrink is your water bill.” - ''ASKO''
* “Did you know that between 80 and 85 percent of the energy used to wash clothes comes from heating the water? Tide Coldwater—The Coolest Way to Clean." - ''Tide Coldwater Laundry Detergent''

|-
| Bundling || 
* “Performance and luxury fueled by innovative technology.” - ''Lexus RX400h Hybrid Sports Utility Vehicle''
|}

Besides striking a right balance of focus between product attributes and consumers’ benefits, sustainability marketers should also avoid employing [[Green-washing|unsubstantive claims]] about the socio-environmental benefits of their products.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=31}} This particular form of marketing myopia is best avoided by building an image of credibility for the [[Sustainability brand|brand]] through effective sustainability communication, so that consumers can easily associate their products with sound socio-environmental performances.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=189}}

== Case studies ==

=== Myopia of sustainable services ===

==== Electrolux washing machines ====
According to the authors of Natural Capitalism “product dematerialisation” is one of the prerequisites for a more sustainable business model. In order to become more sustainable the future economy will transform from “sale of goods” to the “sale of services”.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=35}} Belz and Peattie also stress the role of services as a part of sustainable solution, talking of product-related, use-oriented and result-oriented services. Product-related services are offered additionally and they optimize the product use, e.g. automobile companies offering courses on a more ecological and safe driving manner.  In the case of use-oriented services, a service and not a product is sold to the consumer e.g. car-sharing. As for result-oriented services, consumers neither own nor operate a product e. g. public transportation, with consumers only enjoying the outcome of the product, the transportation services.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|pp=159-161}}

“Product dematerialisation” is, too, at risk of incurring in sustainability marketing myopia. In 1999 Electrolux piloted an use-oriented sustainable “pay-per-wash” service in Sweden, failing to succeed because of a myopic marketing approach. New energy and water efficient washing machines were distributed by Electrolux among consumers. Electrolux supplied customers with maintenance services through a central database via the Internet and took care of the disposal and upgrading of the machines. Consumers did not pay for the machines themselves; they were only charged with a small installation fee at the beginning, and through a pay-per-wash charging system (10 Swedish kronor (about 1 $) per wash). However, an excessive emphasis on the green component in the marketing of this service, achieved at the expenses of other consumer benefits and values, failed to convince the consumers.{{sfn|Makower|2005}} According to A. Ottmann et al. not only environmental but also other inherent consumer values should have been better marketed by Electrolux: convenience of pay-per-wash, including easy trade-ins for upgrades, free service and saved money of a new washing machine.  In addition, the sustainable service might have been successful if pay-per-wash convenience would have been bundled with more desirable features.{{sfn|Ottman et al.|2006|p=35}}

=== Myopia of sustainable products ===

==== Fairtrade coffee ====
The initial idea of introducing the [[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade]] coffee certification was to abolish poverty among coffee farmers and their workers by supporting better working conditions and enabling growers to compete in the global market.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=155}} For this reason, Fairtrade coffee started to be acquired directly from the farmers for a higher price than standard coffee. A minimum price for coffee is guaranteed and if the market prices outreach the minimum, growers receive a premium.{{sfn|Hulm|2006|}} In compliance with rising consumers´ demand for environmentally and social beneficial products the Fairtrade certification appears to be an evident indicator. Products marked with the label have to meet standards ensuring that strict social and environmental measures are taken.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=155}}

The first generation of Fairtrade coffee suffered from sustainability marketing myopia.  First, due to the exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological aspects the quality and the taste of the coffee were put into the background. Most coffee farmers used to sell their coffee to both Fairtrade and open markets. As the price in the open market is entirely defined by quality, farmers sold their better quality beans in that market and then squandered their poorer beans into the Fairtrade market, where they were nonetheless ensured a good price. Furthermore, the certainty that Fairtrade buyers would mix supplies together discouraged farmers to improve the quality of their own beans without having any financial reward for that.{{sfn|Singleton|2008|}}

Furthermore, Fairtrade coffee failed to guarantee the social and environmental benefits to the consumer as covenant.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=164}} Moreover, Fairtrade has been accused of misleading consumers about its ability to monitor production practices, with particular regards to salary conditions of temporary workers.{{sfn|Weitzman|2006|}}

The first generation Fairtrade coffee with a worse quality and bitter taste failed to satisfy all customers´ needs and supposedly to improve the social performance along the whole life cycle of the product.

==== Green buildings ====
As well as Electrolux and Fairtrade coffee suppliers, the producers of green buildings in Western Europe suffered from sustainability marketing myopia in the experimental stages of energy-efficient houses. Companies focussed on the energy-efficient attributes of the houses at the expenses of cost-effectiveness and affordability, marketing their products on the basis of [[intergenerational equity]], ecology and energy-savings.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2010|}} In addition, further inherent consumer values as comfort and design were also ignored at these early stages.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=166}}

Nevertheless, since the beginning of the twenty-first century marketers from construction companies have improved their strategies. Successful sustainability marketing concepts have been progressively adopted, including motive alliances  and the use of a new marketing mix based on so-called 4 Cs: consumer solution, consumer cost, communication and convenience.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=33}}{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2010|}} This new approach has fostered a rise in the market share of energy-efficient houses.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2009|p=166}}

81Fünf Holzbau is an example of such a company applying successful marketing strategies. It is a fast expanding German company which focuses on energy-efficient wooden houses. Conventional criteria as high-quality levels and comfort are aligned with sustainable components in the company [[Marketing communications|marketing communication]]: healthy indoor environment created by using natural woods, energy savings and security from future oil price rises are among the arguments used.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2010|}} Their interactive online toolkit “[http://www.energiecomforthaus.de/ Energy Comfort House]” allows to easily calculate the life cycle cost and savings compared to conventional houses and acts, therefore, as a credibility tool.{{sfn|Belz, Pettie|2010|}} In order to offer the broadest choice in terms of consumer solutions, different house models are provided to various customer target groups according to their environmental consciousness and affordability.
