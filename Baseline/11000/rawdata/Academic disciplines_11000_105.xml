'''Aeroecology''' is the discipline for studying how airborne life forms utilize and interact with other biotic and abiotic components of the lower atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080801094258.htm Science Daily] Retrieved 2011-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; The aerosphere is viewed as habitat &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713000670 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2013.02.015 | volume=28 | issue=7 | title=The airspace is habitat | year=2013 | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | pages=377–379 | last1 = Diehl | first1 = Robert H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the way that organisms respond to and take advantage of the dynamic aeroscape has relevance to the ecology, evolution, and conservation of many of the world's bird, bat, insect, and plant species.

The interactions and properties in the [[aerosphere]], the zone that is closest to the Earth's surface, provide selective pressures that influence the size and shape of organisms, their behavioral, sensory, metabolic, and respiratory functions. In contrast to organisms that spend their entire lives on land or in water, organisms that use the aerosphere are almost immediately affected by changing conditions such as winds, [[air density]], oxygen concentrations, precipitation, air temperature, sunlight, polarized light, moonlight, and geomagnetic and gravitational forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/cecb/bats/aeroecology/ Center for Ecology and Conservation Biology] Retrieved 2011-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeroecology has relied upon traditional ecological field studies such as direct observation or detection of organisms flying overhead (e.g., moon watching, thermal cameras, or [[bioacoustics]]). However, the field has been greatly advanced by the inclusion of remotely sensed data, in particular Doppler weather radar or [[NEXRAD]]. In March 2012, an international and interdisciplinary Radar Aeroecology Workshop was held at the National Weather Center on the University of Oklahoma campus in Norman, OK, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3440989 | pmid=22628093 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0384 | volume=8 | issue=5 | title=Radar aeroecology: exploring the movements of aerial fauna through radio-wave remote sensing | journal=Biol Lett | pages=698–701 | last1 = Chilson | first1 = PB | last2 = Bridge | first2 = E | last3 = Frick | first3 = WF | last4 = Chapman | first4 = JW | last5 = Kelly | first5 = JF | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experts in the fields of ecology and meteorology discussed how various radar technologies could be applied to aeroecological questions.  Aeroecology research groups at both the University of Oklahoma &lt;ref&gt;[http://animalmigration.org/ Radar Aeroecology at OU]&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Delaware &lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.udel.edu/aeroecologyprogram/ Aeroecology at the University of Delaware]&lt;/ref&gt; continue to advance the development and integration of remotely sensed data to quantify, qualify, and track biological utilization of the lower aerosphere.

==History==
Aeroecology is a relatively new field of study. It was first introduced as a concept by [[Boston University]] researcher [[Thomas Kunz]] et. al in a paper published in 2008, "Aeroecology: probing and modeling the aerosphere."&lt;ref name="Kunz 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/icb/icn037|pmid=21669768|title=Aeroecology: Probing and modeling the aerosphere|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–11|year=2007|last1=Kunz|first1=T. H|last2=Gauthreaux|first2=S. A|last3=Hristov|first3=N. I|last4=Horn|first4=J. W|last5=Jones|first5=G|last6=Kalko|first6=E. K. V|last7=Larkin|first7=R. P|last8=McCracken|first8=G. F|last9=Swartz|first9=S. M|last10=Srygley|first10=R. B|last11=Dudley|first11=R|last12=Westbrook|first12=J. K|last13=Wikelski|first13=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational aeroecology==
In the traditional sense, aeroecology has been limited to observations taken from the ground of biological organisms occupying the airspace above.  This may include near-surface foraging behavior or moon-watching passage migrants using human observers equipped with optics.  With the advent and adoption of technologies such as [[thermographic cameras]], [[marine radar]], and [[NEXRAD]] to aeroecological studies, the ability to detect and track sufficiently large animals in the aerospere was revolutionized.

==Radar aeroecology==
Aeroecological studies using weather radar were pioneered by Dr. Sidney A. Gauthreaux during his graduate studies at [[Louisiana State University]] and later as a professor at [[Clemson University]].  His initial work with radar images produced by the [[WSR-57]] network revealed much about the trans-Gulf of Mexico arrivals and departures of [[Neotropical]] migratory birds.

===Reflectivity===
Radar beams will reflect off sufficiently dense objects, such as water droplets, airplane fuselages, or flying animals.  The [[reflectance]] of the object will depend upon its [[radar cross-section]], which is dictated by the size, shape, and material composition of the object.  Weather radar reflectivity data represents the sum reflectivity of all objects within the sampled airspace and therefore is a generalization of the amount of rain or, for aeroecological purposes, the abundance of animals in that volume of air.  Aeroecologists use the term "bioscatter" to describe radar reflectance from biological objects.

===Relative velocity===
Weather radars are capable of detecting [[Doppler shift]] in returning waveforms.  This information is used to extrapolate a mean [[relative velocity]] for all objects within the sampled airspace.  Aeroecologists have used this information to distinguish among objects drifting with the wind (particulates such as dust, seeds, or pollen), from objects moving slightly faster/angular to the wind (e.g., insects), and objects moving at least 5–6&amp;nbsp;m/s faster than and/or moving against the predominant direction of the wind (e.g., birds and bats).

===Dual-pol radar===
An upgrade of weather radars to allow [[dual polarization]] of the radar beam promises to provide greater characterization and discrimination of airborne targets.  For aeroecology this promises to allow better capability to distinguish migrating birds from insects, weather, or suspended particulates.  Ratios of horizontal versus vertical beam reflectivity and Doppler shift also hold much potential for gauging discrepancies between the orientation of birds relative to their realized movement paths, providing the means to assess drift compensation among migratory birds.

[[File:Mars-human-exploration-art-astronauts-vehicle-dust-full.jpg|thumb|This space art, titled ''The Next Stop'' was selected by the ESA when discussing its Aurora program.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Liftoff_for_Aurora_Europe_s_first_steps_to_Mars_the_Moon_and_beyond]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Aurora programme''' (sometimes called '''Aurora Exploration Programme''', or simply '''Exploration Programme''') is a [[human spaceflight]] [[List of human spaceflight programs|programme]] of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) established in 2001. The objective is to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for [[Space exploration|exploration]] of the [[Solar System]] using [[robotic spacecraft]] and [[human spaceflight]] to investigate bodies holding promise for traces of [[Astrobiology|life beyond the Earth]].&lt;ref name='Overview'&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora| title = The European Space Exploration Programme Aurora | publisher = [[ESA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/topic/exploration/moon-to-mars/assessing-aurora/ |title=Assessing Aurora |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=April 7, 2007 |accessdate=2015-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Member states commit to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year periods, after which they can change their level of participation or pull out entirely. In the early years the Aurora programme planned for flagship missions and arrow missions for key technology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars aerocapture demonstrator. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the [[ExoMars]] mission and preparations for an international [[Mars sample return mission]].&lt;ref name='Overview'/&gt;

{{quote|The objective of the Aurora Programme is first to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of solar system bodies holding promise for traces of life. |ESA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Aurora programme was a response to Europe's Strategy for space which  was endorsed by [[European Union Council of Research]] and the ESA Council.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Aurora_s_origins]&lt;/ref&gt; Europe strategy for space had three main points including:"explore the solar system and the Universe", "stimulate new technology", and "inspire the young people of Europe to take a greater interest in science and technology".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the foundational principles of the Aurora program is recognising the interdependence of technology and exploration;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt;

==Missions==
[[Image:ExoMars model at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|ExoMars rover model (for the 2020 launch)]]
The first decade is planned to focus on [[robot]]ic missions.

===Flagship missions===
[[File:ExoMars 2016 Launch.jpg|thumb|ExoMars launches in 2016]]
ESA describes some Aurora programme missions as "Flagship" missions. The first Flagship mission is [[ExoMars]], a dual robotic mission to [[Mars]] made in cooperation with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos). It will involve development of a Mars orbiter ([[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]]), a technology demonstrator [[lander (spacecraft)|descent module]] (Schiaparelli lander) and the [[ExoMars rover]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1NVZKQAD_0.html | title = ExoMars | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship missions considered for the Aurora programme include:
* ''[[ExoMars]]'', consisting of an uncrewed Mars orbiter and lander launched jointly with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2016 on Proton rocket with Fregat upper stage.
* [[ExoMars rover]] launch to be conducted jointly the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2020
* a robotic ''[[Mars Sample Return Mission]]'' by the mid-2020s 
* a human space mission to be launched in the mid-2030s

===Arrow missions===
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
''Arrow missions'' are technology demonstrator missions focused on developing a certain technology needed for the Flagship missions. Approved Arrow missions so far (as of January 30, 2003):
*''Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule'', a step in the preparations for the ''Mars Sample Return'' mission.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*''Mars aerocapture demonstrator'', to further develop the technologies for using a planet's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] to brake into orbit. This particular mission seems to have been revised into an expanded mission to demonstrate "aerobraking/aerocapture, solar electric propulsion and soft landing" to be launched in 2020. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Timeline==
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
The proposed Aurora roadmap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMXZY274OD_index_0.html |title=Aurora’s roadmap to Mars / Exploration / Human Spaceflight / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=2003-12-19 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as of September 30, 2005. This roadmap can, and most likely will, go through revisions):
* 2014 – Human mission technologies demonstrator(s) to validate technologies for orbital assembly and docking, life support and human habitation{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2016 and 2020 – [[ExoMars rover]] to Mars. The scientific objectives include exobiological studies as well as study of the surface of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study ExoMars|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/exomars|publisher=UK Government Space Agency|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2024 – Human mission to the Moon{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2026 – Automatic mission to Mars{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2030s – First human mission to Mars, as a split mission. The proposed Ariane M rocket may be used for this landing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The human part of the programme has been challenged by the main ESA contributors (France, Germany and Italy), making it quite possible that the whole Aurora Programme will be refocused on robotic-only exploration of Mars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5440">The '''Biblical Manuscripts in the Freer Collection''', a collection of six [[biblical manuscript]]s, date from the 3rd to 6th centuries. Most manuscripts are written in [[Greek language|Greek]], one in [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. They are important witnesses of the history of the text of [[New Testament]] and [[Septuagint]]. The collection was established by [[Charles Lang Freer|Charles Freer]] (1854–1919), industrialist from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] and is held at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]].

All these manuscripts were purchased at the beginning of the 20th century in [[Egypt]] by Charles Freer. Four manuscripts were bought on 19 December 1906 from an Arab dealer named Ali in [[Giza]], not far from [[Cairo]]. Freer paid £1,600. Upon the next expedition to Egypt, Freer met with Ali and acquired a Coptic codex of the [[Psalms]] and the earliest [[papyrus]] codex of the [[Minor Prophets]].

Formerly these manuscripts were held in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in Freer's private collection. He gave his art collections to the United States and funds for a building to house them. The building cost $1,000,000, all of which was paid by Freer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroit1701.org/FreerHouse.htm Charles Lang Freer Home] from Detroit1701.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Freer Gallery of Art]] was opened in 1923.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">In [[music]] of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, a '''bicinium''' (pl. '''bicinia''') was a composition for only two parts, especially one for the purpose of teaching [[counterpoint]] or singing.

The term has had two usages in music history:

# Recently, the term has come to mean any composition at all from the Renaissance or early Baroque period for two vocal or instrumental parts.
# Historically, a bicinium referred specifically to a two-part composition used as a teaching tool, most often in [[Protestant]], [[German language|German]]-speaking areas.

The term was first used in [[Poland]], by [[Jan z Lublina]] in a treatise of 1540.  Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], and even in [[Italy]], as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent.  In addition, [[Martin Luther]] had strongly expressed that children should learn both music, and the [[psalm]]s: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose.

Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a [[duet (music)|duet]] more easily than a part in a larger ensemble.  Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher.

This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by [[Heinrich Glarean]] in his ''Dodecachordon'' (1547), one of the most influential [[music theory]] and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance.

In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn [[counterpoint]] first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages.

A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a '''tricinium''' (pl. '''tricinia''').

==Overview==
It is one of [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ten principle capabilities (see [[capabilities approach]]). She defines bodily integrity as: "Being able to move freely from place to place; being able to be secure against violent assault, including [[sexual assault]] ... having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex and Social Justice''. Oxford UP, 1999. 41–42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and law==

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], bodily integrity has been recognised by the courts as an [[Unenumerated rights|unenumerated right]], protected by the general guarantee of "[[personal rights]]" contained within Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. In ''Ryan v Attorney General'' it was pronounced that ""you have the right not to have your body or [[personhood]] interfered with. This means that the State may not do anything to harm your life or health. If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison".&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v Attorney General [1965] 1 IR 294 at 295. Judgement by Kenny J: "That the general guarantee of personal rights in section 3 (1) of Art. 40 extends to rights not specified in Art. 40. One of the personal rights of the citizen protected by the general guarantee is the right to bodily integrity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Right to Bodily Integrity." Citizens Information. 19 Mar. 2008. Citizens Information Board. 4 Apr. 2011 &lt;http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/right_to_bodily_integrity.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a separate case ''M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality &amp; ors,'' the Irish Supreme Court ruled that the right to bodily integrity extended to the unborn.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement by the Irish Supreme Court: M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality &amp; ors, 7th March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary of the case in section 5.19, the Supreme Court stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;“…the only right of the unborn child as the Constitution now stands which attracts the entitlement to protection and vindication is that enshrined by the amendments in Article 40.3.3 namely, the right to life or, in other words, the right to be born and, possibly, (and this is a matter for future decision) allied rights such as the right to bodily integrity which are inherent in and inseparable from the right to life itself”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/09859e7a3f34669680256ef3004a27de/2ca87fab5fd004ff8025824a00329063?OpenDocument | title=M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality &amp; ors : Judgments &amp; Determinations : Courts Service of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Constitution]] does not contain any specific provisions regarding the rights one has with respect to his or her physical body or the specific extent to which the state can act upon bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has upheld [[right to privacy]], which, as articulated by Julie Lane, often protects rights to bodily integrity. In ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965) the Court supported women's rights to obtain birth control (and thus, retain reproductive autonomy) without marital consent. Similarly, a woman's right to privacy in obtaining [[abortion]]s was protected by ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973). In ''[[McFall v. Shimp]]'' (1978), a Pennsylvania court ruled that a person cannot be forced to donate bone marrow, even if such a donation would save another person's life.

Conversely, the Supreme Court has also protected the right of governmental entities to infringe upon bodily integrity. Examples include laws prohibiting the use of drugs, laws prohibiting [[euthanasia]], laws requiring the use of seatbelts and helmets, [[strip search]]es of prisoners, and forced [[Blood test|blood tests]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In general, the Canadian [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] defends personal liberty and the right not to be interfered with. However, in certain unique circumstances government may have the right to temporarily override the right to physical integrity in order to preserve the life of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of supported autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socscience.com/social-sciences/7327.html | title=琪琪布电影网}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the [[forced feeding]] of a person dying from the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], or the temporary treatment of a person living with a [[psychotic disorder]] with [[antipsychotic]] medication).

One unique example of a Canadian law that promotes bodily integrity is the [[Ontario Health Care Consent Act]]. This Ontario law has to do with the capacity to [[consent]] to medical treatment.  The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to ''understand'' and ''appreciate'' the information that is relevant to making such a decision.

== Human rights ==

Two key international documents protect these rights: the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

The Human Rights and Constitutional Rights project, funded by Columbia Law School, has defined four main areas of potential bodily integrity abuse by governments. These are: Right to Life, [[Slavery]] and Forced Labor, Security of One's Person, [[Torture]] and Inhumane, [[cruel and unusual punishment |Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].

== Women's rights ==
Though bodily integrity is (according to the [[capabilities approach]]) afforded to every human being, women are more often affected in violations of gender-based violence.[citation needed] These include [[sexual assault]], unwanted pregnancy, [[domestic abuse]], and limited access to [[contraception]]. These principles were addressed in the CCL Working Conference on Women's Rights as Human Rights. The conference defined bodily integrity as a right deserved by all women: "bodily integrity unifies women and that no woman can say that it does not apply to them".

As defined by the conference participants, the following are bodily integrity rights that should be guaranteed to women:
* [[Freedom of movement]]
* [[Security of person]]s
* [[Reproductive rights|Reproductive and sexual rights]]
* [[Women's health]]
* Breaking women's [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]]
* [[Education]]
* Networking&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Niamh. "Bodily Integrity and Security of Person." Women's Human Rights Campaign Ireland. 05 Apr. 2011 &lt;http://whr1998.tripod.com/documents/icclbodily.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's rights ==
{{see also|Children's rights|Child grooming}}
=== United States ===
The debate over children's rights to bodily integrity has grown in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, Patricia. ''Researching Children's Rights to Integrity'' in ''Children's Childhoods: Observed And Experienced''. The Falmer Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the highly publicized [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Jerry Sandusky trial]],&lt;ref&gt;''
Overheard on CNN.com: Are you a 'huggy' person? Would you make a child hug?''. CNN, 20 June 2012.&lt;http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/20/overheard-on-cnn-com-are-you-a-huggy-person-would-you-make-a-child-hug/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  parents have been increasingly encouraged to promote their child's sense of bodily integrity as a method of reducing children's vulnerability to being victims of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual violence]], [[Trafficking of children|human trafficking]] and [[child prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Hetter, Katia. ''I don't own my child's body''. CNN, 20 July 2015. &lt;http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/20/living/give-grandma-hug-child/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of increasing children's sense of bodily autonomy include:
* Allowing children to choose when to give hugs/kisses
* Encouraging children to communicate about [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]]
* Offer alternative actions (e.g. a [[high five]], handshake, etc.)

In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."

In [[computer science]], the '''Boolean satisfiability problem''' (sometimes called '''propositional satisfiability problem''' and abbreviated '''SATISFIABILITY''' or '''SAT''') is the problem of determining if there exists an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] that [[Satisfiability|satisfies]] a given [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula [[Validity (logic)|evaluates to TRUE]]. If this is the case, the formula is called ''satisfiable''. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is [[Contradiction#Contradiction in formal logic|FALSE]] for all possible variable assignments and the formula is ''unsatisfiable''. For example, the formula "''a'' AND NOT ''b''" is satisfiable because one can find the values ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;TRUE and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, which make (''a'' AND NOT ''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;TRUE. In contrast, "''a'' AND NOT ''a''" is unsatisfiable.

SAT is the first problem that was proven to be [[NP-complete]]; see [[Cook–Levin theorem]]. This means that all problems in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], which includes a wide range of natural decision and optimization problems, are at most as difficult to solve as SAT. There is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each SAT problem, and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically, and resolving the question of whether SAT has a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm is equivalent to the [[P versus NP problem]], which is a famous open problem in the theory of computing.

Nevertheless, as of 2007, heuristic SAT-algorithms are able to solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and &lt;!---"clauses" hasn't been introduced here:---&gt;formulas consisting of millions of symbols,&lt;ref name="Codish.Ohrimenko.Stuckey.2007"/&gt; which is sufficient for many practical SAT problems from, e.g., [[artificial intelligence]], [[circuit design]], and [[automatic theorem proving]].

==Basic definitions and terminology==
A ''[[propositional logic]] formula'', also called ''Boolean expression'', is built from [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], operators AND ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], also denoted by ∧), OR ([[logical disjunction|disjunction]], ∨), NOT ([[negation]], ¬), and parentheses.
A formula is said to be ''satisfiable'' if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate [[logical value]]s (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables.
The ''Boolean satisfiability problem'' (SAT) is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable.
This [[decision problem]] is of central importance in many areas of [[computer science]], including [[theoretical computer science]], [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], [[algorithmics]], [[cryptography]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

There are several special cases of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which the formulas are required to have a particular structure. A ''literal'' is either a variable, called ''positive literal'', or the negation of a variable, called ''negative literal''.
A ''clause'' is a disjunction of literals (or a single literal). A clause is called a ''[[Horn clause]]'' if it contains at most one positive literal.
A formula is in ''[[conjunctive normal form]]'' (CNF) if it is a conjunction of clauses (or a single clause).
For example, {{math|size=100%|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a positive literal, {{math|size=100%|¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a negative literal, {{math|size=100%|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a clause, and {{math|size=100%|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a formula in conjunctive normal form; its first and third clauses are Horn clauses, but its second clause is not. The formula is satisfiable, by choosing ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; arbitrarily, since (FALSE ∨ ¬FALSE) ∧ (¬FALSE ∨ FALSE ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬FALSE evaluates to (FALSE ∨ TRUE) ∧ (TRUE ∨ FALSE ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ TRUE, and in turn to TRUE ∧ TRUE ∧ TRUE (i.e. to TRUE). In contrast, the CNF formula ''a'' ∧ ¬''a'', consisting of two clauses of one literal, is unsatisfiable, since for ''a''=TRUE or ''a''=FALSE it evaluates to TRUE ∧ ¬TRUE (i.e., FALSE) or FALSE ∧ ¬FALSE (i.e., again FALSE), respectively.

For some versions of the SAT problem,&lt;!---need not list them in detail here---(viz. [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]], [[#XOR-satisfiability|XOR-satisfiability]], and, more general, [[#Schaefer's dichotomy theorem|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], discussed below),---&gt; it is useful to define the notion of a ''generalized conjunctive normal form'' formula, viz. as a conjunction of arbitrarily many ''generalized clauses'', the latter being of the form {{math|''R''(''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for some boolean operator ''R'' and (ordinary) literals {{mvar|''l''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Different sets of allowed boolean operators lead to different problem versions.&lt;!---, see [[#Complexity and restricted versions|below]].---&gt;As an example, ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') is a generalized clause, and ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') ∧ ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') ∧ ''R''(''c'',''d'',¬''z'') is a generalized conjunctive normal form. This formula is used [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|below]], with ''R'' being the ternary operator that is TRUE just when exactly one of its arguments is.
&lt;!---need not explain that already here---If ''R'' is the ternary operator that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is, then a satisfying assignment for the latter formula can be found starting from every possible combination of truth values for ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', except ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, and choosing the values of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' appropriately; cf. the left table under [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]] below.---&gt;

Using the laws of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], every propositional logic formula can be transformed into an equivalent conjunctive normal form, which may, however, be exponentially longer. For example, transforming the formula
(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∧''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ∨ (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∧''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∨ ... ∨ (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;∧''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
into conjunctive normal form yields
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ... ∧}}
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}};
while the former is a disjunction of ''n'' conjunctions of 2 variables, the latter consists of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; clauses of ''n'' variables.

==Complexity and restricted versions==

===Unrestricted satisfiability (SAT)===
{{Main article|Cook–Levin theorem}}

SAT was the first known [[NP-complete]] problem, as proved by [[Stephen Cook]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Stephen A. | authorlink1=Stephen Cook| title = The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures | pages = 151–158 | year = 1971 | url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/1971.pdf| doi = 10.1145/800157.805047| journal = Proceedings of the 3rd Annual ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently by [[Leonid Levin]] at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences#The Academy of Sciences of the USSR|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|authorlink=Leonid Levin|title = Universal search problems (Russian: Универсальные задачи перебора, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission (Russian: Проблемы передачи информа́ции, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115–116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=914&amp;volume=9&amp;year=1973&amp;issue=3&amp;fpage=115&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng (pdf)] {{ru icon}}, translated into English by {{cite journal|last=Trakhtenbrot|first=B. A.|title = A survey of Russian approaches to ''perebor'' (brute-force searches) algorithms|journal = Annals of the History of Computing |volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 384–400|year = 1984|doi=10.1109/MAHC.1984.10036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the concept of an NP-complete problem did not even exist.
The proof shows how every decision problem in the [[complexity class]] [[NP (complexity)|NP]] can be [[reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to the SAT problem for CNF&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SAT problem for ''arbitrary'' formulas is NP-complete, too, since it is easily shown to be in NP, and it cannot be easier than SAT for CNF formulas.&lt;/ref&gt; formulas, sometimes called '''CNFSAT'''.
A useful property of Cook's reduction is that it preserves the number of accepting answers. For example, deciding whether a given [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] has a [[Graph coloring#Vertex coloring|3-coloring]] is another problem in NP; if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the Cook–Levin reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.

NP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances.  Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly.  See [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|Algorithms for solving SAT]] below.

SAT is trivial if the formulas are restricted to those in '''[[disjunctive normal form]]''', that is, they are disjunction of conjunctions of literals. Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if at least one of its conjunctions is satisfiable, and a conjunction is satisfiable if and only if it does not contain both ''x'' and NOT ''x'' for some variable ''x''. This can be checked in linear time. Furthermore, if they are restricted to being in '''full disjunctive normal form''', in which every variable appears exactly once in every conjunction, they can be checked in constant time (each conjunction represents one satisfying assignment).  But it can take exponential time and space to convert a general SAT problem to disjunctive normal form; for an example exchange "∧" and "∨" in the [[#Basic definitions and terminology|above]] exponential blow-up example for conjunctive normal forms.

===3-satisfiability===
[[File:Sat reduced to Clique from Sipser.svg|thumb|The 3-SAT instance (''x''∨''x''∨''y'') ∧ (¬''x''∨¬''y''∨¬''y'') ∧ (¬''x''∨''y''∨''y'') reduced to a [[clique problem]]. The green vertices form a 3-clique and correspond to the satisfying assignment ''x''=FALSE, ''y''=TRUE.]]
Like the satisfiability problem for arbitrary formulas, determining the satisfiability of a formula in conjunctive normal form where each clause is limited to at most three literals is NP-complete also; this problem is called '''3-SAT''', '''3CNFSAT''', or '''3-satisfiability'''.
To reduce the unrestricted SAT problem to 3-SAT, transform each clause {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to a conjunction of ''n'' − 2 clauses
:{{math|(''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ⋯ ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}
where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;thinsp;⋯&amp;thinsp;,&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are fresh variables not occurring elsewhere.
Although the two formulas are not [[logically equivalent]], they are [[equisatisfiable]]. The formula resulting from transforming all clauses is at most 3 times as long as its original, i.e. the length growth is polynomial.&lt;ref name="Aho.Hopcroft.Ullman.1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred V. Aho |author2=John E. Hopcroft |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms| year=1974| publisher=Addison-Wesley}}; here: Thm.10.4&lt;/ref&gt;

3-SAT is one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]], and it is used as a starting point for proving that other problems are also [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. at least as hard as every other problem in NP. A decision problem is NP-complete if and only if it is in NP and is NP-hard.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by [[polynomial-time reduction]] from 3-SAT to the other problem. An example of a problem where this method has been used is the [[clique problem]]: given a CNF formula consisting of ''c'' clauses, the corresponding [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] consists of a vertex for each literal, and an edge between each two non-contradicting&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. such that one literal is not the negation of the other&lt;/ref&gt; literals from different clauses, cf. picture. The graph has a ''c''-clique if and only if the formula is satisfiable.{{refn|Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman&lt;ref name="Aho.Hopcroft.Ullman.1974"/&gt; (1974); Thm.10.5}}

There is a simple randomized algorithm due to Schöning (1999) that runs in time (4/3)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''n'' is the number of variables in the 3-SAT proposition, and succeeds with high probability to correctly decide 3-SAT.&lt;ref name="Schoning.1999"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Schöning | first1 = Uwe| chapter = A Probabilistic Algorithm for ''k''-SAT and Constraint Satisfaction Problems | title = Proc. 40th Ann. Symp. Foundations of Computer Science| pages = 410–414 | date=Oct 1999 | url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/schoning99.pdf| doi = 10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[exponential time hypothesis]] asserts that no algorithm can solve 3-SAT (or indeed ''k''-SAT for any ''k &gt; 2'') in {{math|exp([[Small o notation#Little-o notation|''o'']](''n''))}} time (i.e., fundamentally faster than exponential in ''n'').

Selman, Mitchell, and Levesque (1996) give empirical data on the difficulty of randomly generated 3-SAT formulas, depending on their size parameters.
Difficulty is measured in number recursive calls made by a [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|DPLL algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bart Selman |author2=David Mitchell |author3=Hector Levesque | title=Generating Hard Satisfiability Problems| journal=Artificial Intelligence| year=1996| volume=81| pages=17–29| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=3CBEAB7E11BF4B2283E9F383810060C1?doi=10.1.1.37.7362&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| doi=10.1016/0004-3702(95)00045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3-satisfiability can be generalized to '''k-satisfiability''' ('''k-SAT''', also '''k-CNF-SAT'''), when formulas in CNF are considered with each clause containing up to ''k'' literals.
However, since for any ''k''≥3, this problem can neither be easier than 3-SAT nor harder than SAT, and the latter two are NP-complete, so must be k-SAT.

Some authors restrict k-SAT to CNF formulas with '''exactly k literals'''. This doesn't lead to a different complexity class either, as each clause {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with ''j''&lt;''k'' literals can be padded with fixed dummy variables to
{{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
After padding all clauses, 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 extra clauses&lt;ref group=note&gt;viz. all [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)#Maxterms|maxterms]] that can be built with {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,⋯,''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, except {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∨⋯∨''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; have to be appended to ensure that only {{math|1=''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=⋯=''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;=FALSE}} can lead to a satisfying assignment. Since ''k'' doesn't depend on the formula length, the extra clauses lead to a constant increase in length. For the same reason, it does not matter whether '''duplicate literals''' are allowed in clauses (like e.g. {{math|¬''x'' ∨ ¬''y'' ∨ ¬''y''}}), or not.

===Exactly-1 3-satisfiability===
[[File:Schaefer's 3-SAT to 1-in-3-SAT reduction.gif|thumb|x100px|'''Left:''' Schaefer's reduction of a 3-SAT clause ''x''∨''y''∨''z''. The result of ''R'' is {{fontcolor|#00a000|TRUE (1)}} if exactly one of its arguments is TRUE, and {{fontcolor|#a00000|FALSE (0)}} otherwise. All 8 combinations of values for ''x'',''y'',''z'' are examined, one per line. The fresh variables ''a'',...,''f'' can be chosen to satisfy all clauses (exactly one {{fontcolor|#00a000|green}} argument for each ''R'') in all lines except the first, where ''x''∨''y''∨''z'' is FALSE. '''Right:''' A simpler reduction with the same properties.]]
A variant of the 3-satisfiability problem is the '''one-in-three 3-SAT''' (also known variously as '''1-in-3-SAT''' and '''exactly-1 3-SAT''').
Given a conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause, the problem is to determine whether there exists a truth assignment to the variables so that each clause has ''exactly'' one TRUE literal (and thus exactly two FALSE literals). In contrast, ordinary 3-SAT requires that every clause has ''at least'' one TRUE literal.
Formally, a one-in-three 3-SAT problem is given as a generalized conjunctive normal form with all generalized clauses using a ternary operator ''R'' that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is. When all literals of a one-in-three 3-SAT formula are positive, the satisfiability problem is called '''one-in-three positive 3-SAT'''.

One-in-three 3-SAT, together with its positive case, is listed as NP-complete problem "LO4" in the standard reference, ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness''
by [[Michael R. Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]].  One-in-three 3-SAT was proved to be NP-complete by [[Thomas Jerome Schaefer]] as a special case of [[Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], which asserts that any problem generalizing Boolean satisfiability in a certain way is either in the class P or is NP-complete.&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;{{Cite conference | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = The complexity of satisfiability problems | booktitle = Proceedings of the 10th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing | place = San Diego, California | journal =  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 216–226 | publisher =  | jstor =  | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/csg260/f06/materials/papers/max-sat/p216-schaefer.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaefer gives a construction allowing an easy polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to one-in-three 3-SAT.  Let "(''x'' or ''y'' or ''z'')" be a clause in a 3CNF formula.  Add six fresh boolean variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', and ''f'', to be used to simulate this clause and no other.
&lt;!---now introduced already above---Let ''R''(''u'',''v'',''w'') be a predicate that is TRUE if and only if exactly one of the booleans ''u'', ''v'', and ''w''
is TRUE.---&gt;
Then the formula ''R''(''x'',''a'',''d'') ∧ ''R''(''y'',''b'',''d'') ∧ ''R''(''a'',''b'',''e'') ∧ ''R''(''c'',''d'',''f'') ∧ ''R''(''z'',''c'',FALSE) is satisfiable by some setting of the fresh variables if and only if at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' is TRUE, see picture (left).  Thus any 3-SAT instance with ''m'' clauses and ''n'' variables may be converted into an [[equisatisfiable]] one-in-three 3-SAT instance with 5''m'' clauses and ''n''+6''m'' variables.&lt;ref&gt;(Schaefer, 1978), p.222, Lemma 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reduction involves only four fresh variables and three clauses: ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') ∧ ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') ∧ R(''c'',''d'',¬''z''), see picture (right).

===Not-all-equal 3-satisfiability===
{{main|Not-all-equal 3-satisfiability}}
Another variant is the '''not-all-equal 3-satisfiability''' problem (also called '''NAE3SAT''').
Given a conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause, the problem is to determine if an assignment to the variables exists such that in no clause all three literals have the same truth value. This problem is NP-complete, too, even if no negation symbols are admitted, by Schaefer's dichotomy theorem.&lt;ref name="schaefer"/&gt;

===2-satisfiability===
{{Main article|2-satisfiability}}

SAT is easier if the number of literals in a clause is limited to at most 2, in which case the problem is called '''[[2-SAT]]'''. This problem can be solved in polynomial time, and in fact is [[NL-complete|complete]] for the complexity class [[NL (complexity)|NL]]. If additionally all OR operations in literals are changed to [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operations, the result is called '''exclusive-or 2-satisfiability''', which is a problem complete for the complexity class [[SL (complexity)|SL]] = [[L (complexity)|L]].

===Horn-satisfiability===
{{Main article|Horn-satisfiability}}

The problem of deciding the satisfiability of a given conjunction of Horn clauses is called '''Horn-satisfiability''', or '''HORN-SAT'''.
It can be solved in polynomial time by a single step of the [[Unit propagation]] algorithm, which produces the single minimal model of the set of Horn clauses (w.r.t. the set of literals assigned to TRUE).
Horn-satisfiability is [[P-complete]]. It can be seen as [[P (complexity)|P's]] version of the Boolean satisfiability problem.
Also, deciding the truth of quantified Horn formulas can be done in polynomial time.
&lt;ref name="buningkarpinski"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buning | first1 = H.K. | last2 = Karpinski| first2 =  Marek| last3=Flogel|first3=A.|year = 1995 | title = Resolution for Quantified Boolean Formulas | place =  | journal = Information and Computation | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–18 | publisher = Elsevier | jstor =  | doi= 10.1006/inco.1995.1025| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn clauses are of interest because they are able to express [[Entailment|implication]] of one variable from a set of other variables. Indeed, one such clause ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ... ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''y'' can be rewritten as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ... ∧ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''y'', that is, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are all TRUE, then ''y'' needs to be TRUE as well.

A generalization of the class of Horn formulae is that of renameable-Horn formulae, which is the set of formulae that can be placed in Horn form by replacing some variables with their respective negation.
For example, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not a Horn formula, but can be renamed to the Horn formula (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by introducing ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as negation of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
In contrast, no renaming of (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a Horn formula.
Checking the existence of such a replacement can be done in linear time; therefore, the satisfiability of such formulae is in P as it can be solved by first performing this replacement and then checking the satisfiability of the resulting Horn formula.

Another special case is the class of problems where each clause contains XOR (i.e. [[exclusive or]]) rather than (plain) OR operators.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally, generalized conjunctive normal forms with a ternary boolean operator ''R'' are employed, which is TRUE just if 1 or 3 of its arguments is. An input clause with more than 3 literals can be transformed into an equisatisfiable conjunction of clauses á 3 literals similar to [[#3-satisfiability|above]]; i.e. XOR-SAT can be reduced to XOR-3-SAT.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is in [[P (complexity class)|P]], since an XOR-SAT formula can also be viewed as a system of linear equations mod 2, and can be solved in cubic time by [[Gaussian elimination]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Nature of Computation|first1=Cristopher|last1=Moore|author1-link=Cristopher Moore|first2=Stephan|last2=Mertens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199233212|page=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4zMiZyAE1kC&amp;pg=PA366}}.&lt;/ref&gt; see the box for an example. This recast is based on the [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Boolean rings|kinship between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings]], and the fact that arithmetic modulo two forms a [[finite field]]. Since ''a'' XOR ''b'' XOR ''c'' evaluates to TRUE if and only if exactly 1 or 3 members of {''a'',''b'',''c''} are TRUE, each solution of the 1-in-3-SAT problem for a given CNF formula is also a solution of the XOR-3-SAT problem, and in turn each solution of XOR-3-SAT is a solution of 3-SAT, cf. picture. As a consequence, for each CNF formula, it is possible to solve the XOR-3-SAT problem defined by the formula, and based on the result infer either that the 3-SAT problem is solvable or that the 1-in-3-SAT problem is unsolvable.

Provided that the [[P = NP problem|complexity classes P and NP are not equal]], neither 2-, nor Horn-, nor XOR-satisfiability is NP-complete, unlike SAT.

===Schaefer's dichotomy theorem===
{{Main article|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem}}
The restrictions above (CNF, 2CNF, 3CNF, Horn, XOR-SAT) bound the considered formulae to be conjunctions of subformulae; each restriction states a specific form for all subformulae: for example, only binary clauses can be subformulae in 2CNF.

Schaefer's dichotomy theorem states that, for any restriction to Boolean operators that can be used to form these subformulae, the corresponding satisfiability problem is in P or NP-complete.  The membership in P of the satisfiability of 2CNF, Horn, and XOR-SAT formulae are special cases of this theorem.&lt;ref name="schaefer"/&gt;

==Extensions of SAT==
An extension that has gained significant popularity since 2003 is '''[[satisfiability modulo theories]]''' ('''SMT''') that can enrich CNF formulas with linear constraints, arrays, all-different constraints, [[uninterpreted function]]s,&lt;ref name="Bryant.German.Velev.1999"&gt;R. E. Bryant, S. M. German, and M. N. Velev, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=709275 Microprocessor Verification Using Efficient Decision Procedures for a Logic of Equality with Uninterpreted Functions], in Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–13, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''etc.'' Such extensions typically remain NP-complete, but very efficient solvers are now available that can handle many such kinds of constraints.

The satisfiability problem becomes more difficult if both "for all" ([[∀]]) and "there exists" ([[∃]]) [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s are allowed to bind the Boolean variables.
An example of such an expression would be {{math|size=100%|∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∃''z'' (''x'' ∨ ''y'' ∨ ''z'') ∧ (¬''x'' ∨ ¬''y'' ∨ ¬''z'')}}; it is valid, since for all values of ''x'' and ''y'', an appropriate value of ''z'' can be found, viz. ''z''=TRUE if both ''x'' and ''y'' are FALSE, and ''z''=FALSE else.
SAT itself (tacitly) uses only ∃ quantifiers.
If only ∀ quantifiers are allowed instead, the so-called '''[[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] problem''' is obtained, which is [[co-NP-complete]].
If both quantifiers are allowed, the problem is called the '''[[quantified Boolean formula problem]]''' ('''QBF'''), which can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved. Using highly parallel ''[[P system]]s'', QBF-SAT problems can be solved in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alhazov | first1 = Artiom | last2 = Martín-Vide | first2 = Carlos | last3 = Pan | first3 = Linqiang | title = Solving a PSPACE-Complete Problem by Recognizing P Systems with Restricted Active Membranes | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2371013 | journal = Fundamenta Informaticae | volume = 58 | pages = 67–77 | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary SAT asks if there is at least one variable assignment that makes the formula true. A variety of variants deal with the number of such assignments:
* '''MAJ-SAT''' asks if the majority of all assignments make the formula TRUE. It is known to be complete for [[PP (complexity)|PP]], a probabilistic class.
* '''[[Sharp-SAT|#SAT]]''', the problem of counting how many variable assignments satisfy a formula, is a counting problem, not a decision problem, and is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]].
* '''UNIQUE-SAT''' is the problem of determining whether a formula has exactly one assignment. It is complete for [[US (complexity)|US]], the [[complexity class]] describing problems solvable by a non-deterministic polynomial time [[Turing machine]] that accepts when there is exactly one nondeterministic accepting path and rejects otherwise.
* '''UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT''' is the name given to the satisfiability problem when the input is [[Promise problem|restricted]] to formulas having at most one satisfying assignment. A solving algorithm for UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT is allowed to exhibit any behavior, including endless looping, on a formula having several satisfying assignments. Although this problem seems easier, Valiant and Vazirani have [[Valiant-Vazirani theorem|shown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Valiant | first1 = L. | last2 = Vazirani | first2 = V.| doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(86)90135-0 | title = NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions | url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos528/handouts/NP_is_as.pdf| journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 47 | pages = 85–93 | year = 1986 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that if there is a practical (i.e. [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|randomized polynomial-time]]) algorithm to solve it, then all problems in [[NP (complexity class)|NP]] can be solved just as easily.
* '''MAX-SAT''', the [[maximum satisfiability problem]], is an [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] generalization of SAT. It asks for the maximum number of clauses, which can be satisfied by any assignment. It has efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s, but is NP-hard to solve exactly. Worse still, it is [[APX]]-complete, meaning there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for this problem unless P=NP.

Other generalizations include satisfiability for [[first-order predicate calculus|first]]- and [[second-order logic]], [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, [[0-1 integer programming]].

==Self-reducibility==
The SAT problem is '''self-reducible''', that is, each algorithm which correctly answers if an instance of SAT is solvable can be used to find a satisfying assignment. First, the question is asked on the given formula Φ. If the answer is "no", the formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise, the question is asked on the partly instantiated formula Φ[[substitution (logic)|{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE}]], i.e. Φ with the first variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; replaced by TRUE, and simplified accordingly. If the answer is "yes", then ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE, otherwise ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=FALSE. Values of other variables can be found subsequently in the same way. In total, ''n''+1 runs of the algorithm are required, where ''n'' is the number of distinct variables in Φ.

This property of self-reducibility is used in several theorems in complexity theory:

: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⊆ [[P/poly]] ⇒ [[PH (complexity)|PH]] = [[Polynomial hierarchy#Definitions|Σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Karp–Lipton theorem]])
: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⊆ [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]] ⇒ [[NP (complexity)|NP]] = [[RP (complexity)|RP]]
: [[P (complexity)|P]] = [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⇒ [[FP (complexity)|FP]] = [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]]

==Algorithms for solving SAT==

Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade{{When|date=July 2016}} and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).&lt;ref name="Codish.Ohrimenko.Stuckey.2007"&gt;{{citation|title=Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming – CP 2007|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=4741|year=2007|pages=544–558|contribution=Propagation = Lazy Clause Generation|first1=Olga|last1=Ohrimenko|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|first3=Michael|last3=Codish|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_39|quote=modern SAT solvers can often handle problems with millions of constraints and hundreds of thousands of variables|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5471}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such problems in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) include [[formal equivalence checking]], [[model checking]], [[formal verification]] of [[microprocessor|pipelined microprocessors]],&lt;ref name="Bryant.German.Velev.1999"/&gt; [[automatic test pattern generation]], [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] of [[FPGA]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gi-Joon Nam | last2 = Sakallah | first2 = K.

A SAT-solving engine is now considered to be an essential component in the [[electronic design automation|EDA]] toolbox.

There are two classes of high-performance [[algorithms]] for solving instances of SAT in practice: the [[conflict-driven clause learning]] algorithm, which can be viewed as a modern variant of the [[DPLL algorithm]] (well known implementations include [[Chaff algorithm|Chaff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Moskewicz | first1 = M.

A DPLL SAT solver employs a systematic backtracking search procedure to explore the (exponentially sized) space of variable assignments looking for satisfying assignments. The basic search procedure was proposed in two seminal papers in the early 1960s (see references below) and is now commonly referred to as the [[Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm]] ("DPLL" or "DLL").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = H. | title = A Computing Procedure for Quantification Theory | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 201 | year = 1960 | doi = 10.1145/321033.321034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. |authorlink1=Martin Davis| last2 = Logemann | first2 = G. | last3 = Loveland | first3 = D. | title = A machine program for theorem-proving | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 394–397 | year = 1962 | url = http://www.ensiie.fr/~blazy/ipr/article2.pdf| doi = 10.1145/368273.368557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, exponential lower bounds have been proved for the DPLL family of algorithms.

In contrast, randomized algorithms like the PPSZ algorithm by Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane set variables in a random order according to some heuristics, for example bounded-width [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. If the heuristic can't find the correct setting, the variable is assigned randomly. The PPSZ algorithm has a runtime of &lt;math&gt;O(2^{0.386n})&lt;/math&gt; for 3-SAT with a single satisfying assignment. Currently this is the best-known runtime for this problem. In the setting with many satisfying assignments the randomized algorithm by Schöning has a better bound.&lt;ref name="Schoning.1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppsz_algorithm"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1066101 "An improved exponential-time algorithm for k-SAT"], Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, Zani&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern SAT solvers (developed in the last ten years{{When|date=July 2016}}) come in two flavors: "conflict-driven" and "look-ahead".{{clarify|reason=3 paragraphs before here, 'two classes', viz. 'conflict-driven clause learning DPLL' and 'stochastic local search' were named. Please indicate if the latter essentially means the same as 'look-ahead' here.|date=September 2013}} Conflict-driven solvers augment the basic DPLL search algorithm with efficient conflict analysis, clause learning, non-[[chronological backtracking]] (a.k.a. [[backjumping]]), as well as [["two-watched-literals" unit propagation]], adaptive branching, and random restarts. These "extras" to the basic systematic search have been empirically shown to be essential for handling the large SAT instances that arise in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vizel | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weissenbacher | first2 = G. | last3 = Malik | first3 = S. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 103 | issue = 11 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455034|title=Boolean Satisfiability Solvers and Their Applications in Model Checking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Look-ahead solvers have especially strengthened reductions (going beyond unit-clause propagation) and the heuristics, and they are generally stronger than conflict-driven solvers on hard instances (while conflict-driven solvers can be much better on large instances which actually have an easy instance inside).

Modern SAT solvers are also having significant impact on the fields of software verification, constraint solving in artificial intelligence, and operations research, among others. Powerful solvers are readily available as [[free and open source software]]. In particular, the conflict-driven [http://minisat.se/ MiniSAT], which was relatively successful at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2005 SAT competition], only has about 600 lines of code. A modern Parallel SAT solver is [http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~jabbour/manysat.htm ManySAT]. It can achieve super linear speed-ups on important classes of problems. An example for look-ahead solvers is [http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php march_dl], which won a prize at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2007 SAT competition].

Certain types of large random satisfiable instances of SAT can be solved by [[survey propagation]] (SP). Particularly in [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]] applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are sometimes decided based on a representation of the formula as a [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD).

Almost all SAT solvers include time-outs, so they will terminate in reasonable time even if they cannot find a solution.
Different SAT solvers will find different instances easy or hard, and some excel at proving unsatisfiability, and others at finding solutions.
All of these behaviors can be seen in the SAT solving contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satcompetition.org/ |title=The international SAT Competitions web page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAT problem format===
A SAT problem is often described in the [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/uploads/ResearchProjects/Spear/dimacs-cnf.pdf DIMACS-CNF] format: an input file in which each line represents a single disjunction. For example, a file with the two lines
 1 -5 4 0
 -1 5 3 4 0
represents the formula "(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)".

Another common format for this formula is the 7-bit [[ASCII]] representation "(x1 | ~x5 | x4) &amp; (~x1 | x5 | x3 | x4)".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1073">The '''CLEAN''' algorithm is a computational algorithm to perform a [[deconvolution]] on images created in [[radio astronomy]]. It was published by {{ill|Jan Högbom|sv}} in 1974&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/1974A%26AS...15..417H Aperture Synthesis with a Non-Regular Distribution of Interferometer Baselines], original publication by Jan Högbom about CLEAN, in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement, Vol. 15, p.417&lt;/ref&gt; and several variations have been proposed since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/map-html/node37.html The family of CLEAN algorithms], a chapter from the ''MAPPING'' software manual&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm assumes that the image consists of a number of point sources. It will iteratively find the highest value in the image and subtract a small gain of this point source convolved with the [[point spread function]] ("dirty beam") of the observation, until the highest value is smaller than some threshold.

The '''Carte du Ciel''' (literally, 'Map of the Sky') and the '''Astrographic Catalogue''' (or '''Astrographic Chart''') were two distinct but connected components of a massive international astronomical project, initiated in the late 19th century, to catalogue and map the positions of millions of [[star]]s as faint as 11th or 12th [[stellar magnitude|magnitude]]. Twenty observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 (glass) photographic plates in an enormous observing programme extending over several decades. Despite, or because of, its vast scale, the project was only ever partially successful &amp;ndash; the Carte du Ciel component was never completed, and for almost half a century the Astrographic Catalogue part was largely ignored. However, the appearance of the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] in 1997 has led to an important development in the use of this historical plate material.

==Origins and goals==
A vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by [[Paris Observatory]] director [[Amédée Mouchez]], who realized the potential of the new [[Dry plate|dry plate photographic process]] to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars.  As a result of the Astrographic Congress of more than 50 astronomers held in Paris in April 1887, 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project, and two goals were established:

For the first, the Astrographic Catalogue, the entire sky was to be photographed to 11&amp;nbsp;mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8&amp;nbsp;mag &amp;ndash; this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component (the Carte du Ciel).  Different observatories around the world were charged with surveying specific declination zones (see table). The Astrographic Catalogue plates, of typically 6&amp;nbsp;minutes exposure, were in due course photographed, measured, and published in their entirety. They yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5&amp;nbsp;mag, and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century.

For the second goal, a second set of plates, with longer exposures but minimal overlap, was to photograph all stars to 14&amp;nbsp;mag. These plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts, the Carte du Ciel, in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments.  Most of the Carte du Ciel plates used three exposures of 20&amp;nbsp;minutes duration, displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10&amp;nbsp;arcsec, making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws, and asteroids from stars.

A fascinating contemporary account of this vast international astronomical collaboration, published in 1912, is given by H.H.&amp;nbsp;Turner, then Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Turner, 1912 ''The Great Star Map, Being a Brief General Account of the International Project Known as the Astrographic Chart'' (John Murray)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other aspects are covered in various papers in the Proceedings of IAU Symposium Number&amp;nbsp;133 held in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of IAU Symposium Number&amp;nbsp;133, ''Mapping the Sky'', editor S. Debarbat, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Astrographic Catalogue ==

[[File:Catalogue photographique du Ciel I-VIII.JPG|thumb|left|Catalogue photographique du Ciel I–VIII published by [[Helsinki University Observatory]] in 1937.]]

For the Astrographic Catalogue, 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates (see table). Around half of the observatories ordered telescopes from the [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry|Henry brothers (Paul and Prosper)]] in France, with others coming from the factory of  [[Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co. Ltd.|Howard Grubb of Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These telescopes were termed ''normal [[astrograph]]s'' with an aperture of around 13&amp;nbsp;inches (33&amp;nbsp;cm) and a focal length of 11 feet (3.4 m) designed to create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 [[Arc minute|arcsecs]]/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. Each observatory was assigned a specific declination zone to photograph.  The first such plate was taken in August 1891 at the [[Vatican Observatory]] (where the exposures took more than 27&amp;nbsp;years to complete), and the last in December 1950 at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium|Ukkel Observatory]] (Brussels), with most observations being made between 1895 and 1920.  To compensate for plate defects, each area of the sky was photographed twice, using a two-fold, corner-to-centre overlap pattern, extended at the zone boundaries, such that each observatory's plates would overlap with those of the adjacent zones.  The participating observatories agreed to use a standardized telescope so that all plates had a similar scale of approximately 60&amp;nbsp;arcsec/mm.  The measurable areas of the plates were 2.1°×2.1° (13&amp;nbsp;cm×13&amp;nbsp;cm), so the overlap pattern consisted of plates that were centred on every degree band in declination, but offset in right ascension by two degrees.  Many factors, such as reference catalogue, reduction technique and print formats were left up to the individual institutions. The positional accuracy goal was 0.5&amp;nbsp;arcsec per image.
  
Plate measurement was a protracted affair, with measuring done by eye and recorded by hand.  The plates were turned over to a large number of semi-skilled "computers" to determine the positions of the stars on each plate. (Before its modern meaning, the word "computer" meant a person who performs calculations). The "computers" would manually measure each star with respect to the dozen or so reference stars within that particular plate, and then perform calculations to determine the star's [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. The original goal of 11&amp;nbsp;mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed, however, with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13&amp;nbsp;mag.  In total, some 4.6&amp;nbsp;million stars (8.6&amp;nbsp;million images) were observed. The brightest stars were over-exposed on the plates, not measured, and therefore missing in the resulting catalogues.  The plate measurements (as rectangular coordinates), as well as the formulae to transform them to equatorial coordinates, were published in the original volumes of the Astrographic Catalogue, although the accompanying equatorial coordinates are now of only historical interest.  Publication of the measurements proceeded from 1902 to 1964, and resulted in 254 printed volumes of raw data. 
  
For decades the Astrographic Catalogue was largely ignored. The data were difficult to work with because they were available neither in machine-readable form nor in equatorial coordinates. Decades of labour were expended internationally before the project was superseded by modern astronomical techniques.  One problem was that the work took much longer than expected.  As originally envisaged, the project was meant to have taken only 10 to 15 years.  A more serious problem was that while many European astronomers were preoccupied with this project, which required steady, methodical labor rather than creativity, in other parts of the world notably the United States [[astrophysics]] was becoming far more important than [[astrometry]].  As a result, French astronomy in particular fell behind and lagged for decades.

==The Carte du Ciel==
The still-more-ambitious Carte du Ciel component of the programme was undertaken by some of the participating observatories, but neither completed nor even started by others. The charts proved to be excessively expensive to photograph and reproduce, generally via engraved copper plates ([[photogravure]]), and many zones were either not completed or properly published. The plates which were taken generally still exist, but cover only half of the sky. They are typically archived at their original observatories. A very few plates have recently been re-measured and re-analysed with the availability  of the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] data (see below).

==Combination of the Astrographic Catalogue with Hipparcos==

The vast amount of work invested in the Astrographic Catalogue, taking plates, measuring, and publishing, looked for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit. But today, astronomers are very much indebted to this great effort because of the possibility of combining these century-old star positions with the results from ESA's [[Hipparcos]] space astrometry satellite, allowing high accuracy proper motions to be derived for 2.5&amp;nbsp;million stars. Specifically, the Astrographic Catalogue positions were transferred from the decades-old printed catalogues into machine readable form (undertaken at the [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute]] in Moscow under the leadership of A.&amp;nbsp;Kuzmin) between 1987 and 1994. The data were then reduced anew (at the [[US Naval Observatory]] in Washington under the leadership of Sean Urban), using the reference stars measured by the [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stars from the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the Astrographic Catalogue plates, while the 2.5 million stars in the Tycho-2 Catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected. The proper motions of all the Tycho Catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the Astrographic Catalogue, but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues. Aside from the 120,000 stars of the Hipparcos Catalogue itself, the resulting Tycho-2 Catalogue (compiled at the [[Copenhagen University Observatory]] under the leadership of Erik Høg) is now the largest, most accurate and most complete, star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky. It is currently the basis for deriving positions for all fainter stars on the sky. Sean Urban of the [[US Naval Observatory]] wrote in 1998:&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''The history of the Astrographic Catalogue endeavour is one of dedicated individuals devoting tedious decades of their careers to a single goal. Some believe it is also the story of how the best European observatories of the 19th century lost their leadership in astronomical research by committing so many resources to this one undertaking. Long portrayed as an object lesson in overambition, the Astrographic Catalogue has more recently turned into a lesson in the way that old data can find new uses.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Cause''', also known as '''etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) and '''aetiology''', is the [[Causality|reason]] or origination of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth J. |last=Rothman |authorlink=Kenneth Rothman (epidemiologist) |first2=Sander |last2=Greenland |authorlink2=Sander Greenland |first3=Charles |last3=Poole |first4=Timothy L. |last4=Lash |chapter=Causation and Causal Inference |title=Modern Epidemiology |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |edition=Third |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-5564-1 |pages=6–7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.de/books?id=Z3vjT9ALxHUC&amp;pg=PA6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] put forward early ideas about [[microorganism]]s in a 1st-century BC book titled ''On Agriculture''.&lt;ref&gt;''Varro On Agriculture'' 1, xii Loeb&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval thinking on the etiology of disease showed the influence of [[Galen]] and of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/83/979/352 Maimonides: an early but accurate view on the treatment of hemorrhoids -- Magrill and Sekaran 83 (979): 352 -- Postgraduate Medical Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval [[Europe]]an doctors generally held the view that disease was related to the air and adopted a [[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatic approach]] to disease etiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/w44720475g378602.pdf Case study: the history and ethics clean air]&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiological discovery in medicine has a history in [[Robert Koch]]'s demonstration that the tubercle bacillus (''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' complex) causes the disease [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' causes [[anthrax]], and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' causes [[cholera]].  This line of thinking and evidence is summarized in [[Koch's postulates]]. But proof of causation in infectious diseases is limited to individual cases that provide experimental evidence of etiology.

In [[epidemiology]], several lines of evidence together are required to infer causation. [[Austin Bradford Hill|Sir Austin Bradford-Hill]] demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and summarized the line of reasoning in the epidemiological criteria for causation. Dr. Al Evans, a US epidemiologist, synthesized his predecessors' ideas in proposing the Unified Concept of Causation.

==Chain of causation and correlation==

Further thinking in epidemiology was required to [[correlation is not causation|distinguish causation from association or statistical correlation]]. Events may occur together simply due to [[Randomness|chance]], [[bias]] or [[confounding]], instead of one event being caused by the other. It is also important to know which event is the cause. Careful sampling and measurement are more important than sophisticated statistical analysis to determine causation. Experimental evidence involving interventions (providing or removing the supposed cause) gives the most compelling evidence of etiology.

Related to this, sometimes several symptoms always appear together, or more often than what could be expected, though it is known that one cannot cause the other. These situations are called [[syndrome]]s, and normally it is assumed that an underlying condition must exist that explains all the symptoms.

Other times there is not a single cause for a disease, but instead a chain of causation from an initial trigger to the development of the clinical disease. An etiological agent of disease may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that [[peptic ulcer disease]] may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or [[risk factor]]s which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology.{{r to section}}

==Etiological heterogeneity==

Some diseases, such as [[diabetes]] or [[hepatitis]], are syndromically defined by their signs and [[symptom]]s, but include different conditions with different etiologies. These are called [[heterogeneous condition]]s.

Conversely, a single etiology, such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]], may in different circumstances produce different diseases such as [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], or [[Burkitt's lymphoma]].

===Endotype===
{{main|endotype}}
An '''endotype''' is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or [[Pathobiology|pathobiological]] mechanism. This is distinct from a [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotype]], which is any observable characteristic or trait of a [[disease]], such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that [[patient]]s with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.

One example is asthma, which is considered to be a [[syndrome]], consisting of a series of endotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lötvall |first=J. |last2=Akdis |first2=C. A. |last3=Bacharier |first3=L. B. |last4=Bjermer |first4=L. |last5=Casale |first5=T. B. |last6=Custovic |first6=A. |last7=Lemanske |first7=R. F. Jr. |last8=Wardlaw |first8=A.

Other example could be [[AIDS]], where an HIV infection can produce several [[clinical stage]]s. AIDS is defined as the clinical stage IV of the HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kenneth G. |last=Castro |first2=John W. |last2=Ward |first3=Laurence |last3=Slutsker |first4=James W. |last4=Buehler |first5=Harold W. |last5=Jaffe |first6=Ruth L. |last6=Berkelman |title=1993 Revised Classification System for HIV Infection and Expanded Surveillance Case Definition for AIDS among Adolescents and Adults |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=17 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=802–810 |jstor=4457386 |doi=10.1093/clinids/17.4.802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5227">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''circuit''' is a [[model of computation]] in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a [[function (computer science)|function]]. Circuits of this kind provide a generalization of [[Boolean circuit]]s and a mathematical model for [[digital logic]] circuits. Circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce.  For example, the values in a Boolean circuit are [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, and the circuit includes [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], and [[logical negation|negation]] gates.  The values in an [[integer circuit]] are [[set (mathematics)|set]]s of [[integer]]s and the gates compute [[set union]], [[set intersection]], and [[set complement]], as well as the [[arithmetic operation]]s [[addition]] and [[multiplication]].

== Formal definition ==
A circuit is a triple &lt;math&gt;(M, L, G)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set of values,
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a set of gate labels, each of which is a function from &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for some non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of inputs to the gate), and
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[labelled graph|labelled]] [[directed acyclic graph]] with labels from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The vertices of the graph are called ''gates''. For each gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of [[in-degree]] &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; can be labeled by an element &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Terminology ===
The gates of in-degree 0 are called ''inputs'' or ''leaves''. The gates of out-degree 0 are called ''outputs''. If there is an edge from gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to gate &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''child'' of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. We suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph, so we can speak of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th child of a gate when &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is less than the out-degree of the gate.

The ''size'' of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit. The ''depth of a gate'' &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the [[longest path]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; beginning at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; up to an output gate. In particular, the gates of out-degree 0 are the only gates of depth 1. The ''depth of a circuit'' is the maximum depth of any gate. 

''Level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' is the set of all gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. A ''levelled circuit'' is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; comes only from gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i + 1&lt;/math&gt; or from the inputs. In other words, edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit. The ''width'' of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level.

=== Evaluation ===
The exact value &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; of a gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with in-degree &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and label &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively for all gates &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
V(g) = 
\begin{cases}
  l &amp; \text{if } g \text{ is an input} \\
  l(V(g_1), \dotsc, V(g_i)) &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where each &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; is a parent of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates.

== Circuits as functions ==
The labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. If there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leaves, then the circuit can be seen as a function from  &lt;math&gt;M^{n}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. It is then usual to consider a family of circuits &lt;math&gt;(C_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from &lt;math&gt;M^{*}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions of size, depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions, becoming functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;; for example, &lt;math&gt;size(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th circuit of the family. 

== Complexity and algorithmic problems ==

Computing the output of a given [[Boolean circuit]] on a specific input is [[P-complete]] problem. If the input is an [[integer circuit]], however, it is unknown whether this problem is [[decidable language|decidable]].

[[Circuit complexity]] attempts to classify [[Boolean function]]s with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them.

'''Co-cultural communication theory''' was built upon the frameworks of [[muted group theory]] and [[standpoint theory]]. The cornerstone of co-cultural communication theory is muted group theory as proposed in the mid 1970s by Shirley and [[Edwin Ardener]].  The Ardeners were [[cultural anthropologists]] who made the observation that most other cultural anthropologists practicing [[ethnography]] in the field were talking only to the leaders of the cultures, who were by and large adult males. The researchers would then use this data to represent the culture as a whole, leaving out the perspectives of women, children and other groups made voiceless by the cultural hierarchy (S. Ardener, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Ardener, Shirley, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ardeners maintained that groups which function at the top of the society hierarchy determine to a great extent the dominant communication system of the entire society (E. Ardener, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Ardener, Edwin, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ardener's 1975 muted group theory also posited that dominant group members formulate a "communication system that support their perception of the world and conceptualized it as ''the'' appropriate language for the rest of society".&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998a, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication faculty Stanback and Pearce (1981) referred to these non-dominant groups as "subordinate social groups".  They noted 4 ways in which the non-dominant groups tend to communicate with the dominant groups. They also asserted that "From the perspective of the dominant group, the behaviors in each form of [[communication]] are appropriate. However, the meaning of these behaviors to the members of the lower-statused  group are quite different, making them different forms of communication with different implications for the relations among the groups".&lt;ref&gt;Stanback and Pearce, 1981, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of communication, Stanback and Pearce as well as Kramarae used muted group theory to help explain communication patterns and social representation of non-dominant cultural groups Kramarae (1981) believed that "those experiences unique to subordinate group members often cannot be effectively expressed within the confinements of the dominant communication system".&lt;ref&gt;Kramarae, 1981, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that people within these groups create alternative forms of communication to articulate their experiences. Although, Kramarae used muted group theory to communications strategies of women she suggested that the framework can be applied with equal validity to a number of dominant/non-dominant relationships (Orbe, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramarae (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Kramarae, C., 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; presented three assumptions of muted group theory as applied to communication between men and women concluding that women traditionally have been muted by a male-dominated communications system. Additionally, Kramarae proposed seven hypotheses originating in muted group theory.
Standpoint theory was mainly used as a  [[feminist]] theoretical framework to explore experiences of women as they participate in and oppose their own subordination, however, (Smith, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. E., 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the theory had applications for other subordinate groups. A basic tenet of [[standpoint theory]] is that it "seeks to include the experiences of subordinate groups within the process of research inquiry in meaningful ways".&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998a, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, the members of the underrepresented groups become co-researchers.

==Theory==
The theory of co-cultural communication was introduced in 1996 by Mark Orbe, professor in the School of Communication at [[Western Michigan University]], when he found previously used names for the groups under consideration to have negative connotations. He cites previous studies which looked at the communication styles of different co-cultural groups which were referred to by a variety of terms.  Orbe was the first to refer to this type of work as "co-cultural communication theory".  Orbe&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1996, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; states, "in the past researchers have used a variety of terms to describe co-cultural communication: "intracultural" (Sitaram and Cogdell, 1976); "subordinate", "inferior", "minority" (Stanban and Pearce, 1981); "sub-cultural" (Pearson &amp; Nelson, 1991); (Folb, 1994); and "muted group" (Kramarae, 1981)."&lt;ref&gt;See video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x87QW8Jybk&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbe combined the frameworks of muted group theory with that of standpoint theory to arrive at five fundamental concepts which describe co-cultural theory. Orbe&lt;ref&gt;Orbe,  1998b, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; states, "co-cultural theory seeks to uncover the commonalities among co-cultural group members as they function in dominant society while substantiating the vast diversity of experiences between and among groups."

==Application==
Since the introduction of co-cultural theory in "Laying the foundation for co-cultural communication theory: An inductive approach to studying "non-dominant" communication strategies and the factors that influence them" (1996), Orbe has published two works describing the theory and its use as well as several studies on communication patterns and strategies based on different co-cultural groups.

In Orbe's "A Co-cultural communication approach to intergroup relations" (1997), he provides an overview of co-cultural theory, including an explanation of the process by which co-cultural group members strategically select different communications styles.

Orbe (1998a) "Constructing co-cultural theory: an explication of culture, power, and communication", presents the theoretical framework for co-cultural theory including the development of the theory, clarification of the co-cultural communication process, and limitations and future directions for its use. Orbe (1998b) "From the standpoint(s) of traditionally muted groups: Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model", in which he designated 9 co-cultural orientations based on the intersections of three communication approaches: Non-assertive, Assertive, and Aggressive with 3 preferred outcomes: Separation, Accommodation and Assimilation.

In 2000, Orbe and C. M. Greer presented a paper: "Recognizing the diversity of lived experience: The utility of co-cultural theory in communication and disabilities research" at the annual meeting of the [[Central States Communication Association]], in [[Detroit]].  In 2001, Heuman presented "Multiracial/ethnic identity: A co-cultural approach" during the annual meeting of the Central States Communication Association in Cincinnati. During the same meeting Dixon presented "Naming issues in the future of [[intercultural communication]] research: The contributions of Mark Orbe's co-cultural theory".

Orbe (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M., 2004, pp. 191-211&lt;/ref&gt; used co-cultural theory as a foundation to explore the processes by which public dialogue can be facilitated across cultural boundaries. Orbe and Spellers (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M. and Spellers, R. E.,2005, pp. 173-191&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in this book chapter on the origins of co-cultural theory from the perspectives of their different areas of research as well as point to implications for future work.

Orbe &amp; Lapinski (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Lapinski, M. K., &amp; Orbe, M., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; published the design of a self-report measure of the two components of co-cultural theory, preferred outcome and communication approach, and provides evidence from two studies for the [[construct validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the co-cultural theory scales (C-CTS).

Ramirez-Sanchez (2008) examines the possibility of applying co-cultural theory to co-cultural groups that are [[marginalized]] in a larger co-cultural context and to "offer a complex cultural context to which co-cultural theory can be applied and generate questions that could serve to enrich the analytical scope of co-cultural theory and its implications".&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez-Sanchez, 2008, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Camara and Orbe published the article "Analyzing Strategic Responses to Discriminatory Acts: A Co-Cultural Communicative Investigation" in the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication. Two authors utilized Orbe's (1998) co-cultural theory model of the 9 communication orientations and 26 communication practices to identify how co-cultural group members response to the acts of discrimination. Two authors used qualitative content analysis to code the participants’ stories. The paper also oriented the directions of future research.

In 2012, Jungmi Jun, an assistant professor of Department of Communication at Wayne State University, published her article "Why Are Asian Americans Silent? Asian Americans' Negotiation Strategies for Communicative Discriminations" in the ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication''. The author utilized Orbe's co-cultural theory model to explore two questions. One is what types of racially discriminatory messages target Asian Americans; another one is what communicative approaches do Asian Americans apply to negotiate those messages. The paper used content analysis to code 176 stories gained through an online survey. The research found that Asian Americans tend to use nonassertive approaches to respond to racially discriminatory messages due to internal/environmental factors including emotional shock and humiliation, a lack of knowledge of proper responses, peer pressure, and strategic intent.

The '''Concert Companion''' was a hand-held device intended to enhance concert experiences by presenting information that complements the music while the music is being performed. Using wireless technology, the Concert Companion delivered explanatory text, program notes and video images in real time with the music. The Concert Companion was developed under the auspices of the [[Kansas City Symphony]] by former executive director Roland Valliere.

==Testing==

Testing of the Concert Companion took place with the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Pittsburgh Symphony]], [[Aspen Music Festival]], Kansas City Symphony and [[Oakland East Bay Symphony]]. It was featured at the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'''s "D: All Things Digital" executive conference in [[Carlsbad, California]] in June 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos.allthingsd.com/D2/Concert-Companion/542601_btX8fC#!i=22522630&amp;k=gBN2d|title=D2 Gallery|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Association of British Orchestras Conference in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] in February 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7739">'''Dark septate endophytes''' (DSE) are a group of [[endophytic]] [[fungi]] characterized by their morphology of melanized, [[septate]], [[hyphae]]. This group is likely [[paraphyletic]], and contain [[conidium|conidial]] as well as sterile fungi that colonize roots intracellularly or intercellularly.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"&gt;Jumpponen, A. 2001. Dark-Septate Endophytes – are they mycorrhizal? Mycorrhiza 11:207–211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"&gt;Mandyam, K. and Jumpponen, A. 2005. Seeking the elusive function of the root-colonising dark septate endophytic fungi. Studies in Mycology. 53: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about the number of fungal taxa within this group, but all are in the [[Ascomycota]]. They are found in over 600 plant species and across 114 families  of [[angiosperms]] and [[gymnosperms]] and co-occur with other types of [[mycorrhizal fungi]].&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jumpponen|first1=Ari|last2=Trappe|first2=James M.|title=Dark septate endophytes: a review of facultative biotrophic root-colonizing fungi|journal=New Phytologist|volume=140|issue=2|year=1998|pages=295–310|issn=0028-646X|doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a wide global distribution and can be more abundant in stressed environments.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt; Much of their taxonomy, physiology, and ecology are unknown.

==Taxonomy==
Based on analysis of sequences with the small subunit of the nuclear [[ribosomal RNA]] gene (18S), all DSE are within ascomycetes and include taxa in the orders Pleoporales, [[Microascales]], [[Xylariales]], [[Pezizales]], [[Dothideales]], [[Leotiales]], [[Chaetothyriales]], Elaphomycetales, [[Eurotiales]], [[Onygenales]], [[Saccharomycetales]], [[Neolectales]], [[Taphrinales]], [[Mitosporic]], and nonsporulating cultures.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt;

==Natural history==

===Geographical distribution===
Dark septate endophytes have been found in the subantarctic, [[boreal climate|boreal]] coniferous forests in Canada, temperate and boreal forests in Northern and Central Europe, exotic pine plantations in New Zealand,&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; [[temperate grasslands]], ephiphytic plants in [[tropical rain forests]], [[alpine climate|alpine]] environments, and semi-arid environments. Studies in alpine and semi-arid ecosystems have shown that dark septate endophytes are more prevalent than [[arbuscular mycorrhizae]] in these environments.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

===Physiology and function===
Different species and strains of DSE have been found to have [[enzymes]] including laccases, [[lipases]], [[amylases]], and polyphenol oxidases.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; They are capable of breaking down many organic compounds including [[starch]], [[cellulose]], laminari, [[xylan]], [[gelatin]], and [[RNA]] &lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, B.A., Jumpponen, A., Trappe, J.M. 2000. Utilization of Major Detrital Substrates by Dark-Septate, Root Endophytes. Mycologia 92: 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; from detrital nutrient pools. Their nitrogen sources are varied, and dark septate endophytes are able to use [[amino acids]] (e.g. alanine, glycine, and arginine) equally as efficiently as [[ammonium]], as well as other sources like [[guanine]] and [[uric acid]]. Some DSE are also able to hydrolyse organic sulphate.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

A key characteristic of DSE is that they show high melanin content and appear darkened in morphology. This is hypothesized to protect hyphae from extremes in temperatures and drought and improve their persistence in the soil.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

===Plant hosts===
Dark septate endophytes have been observed across the plant kingdom in [[Dicotyledoneae]] and  [[Monocotyledonae]] (Angiospermae), and [[Equisetopsida]], [[Lycopsida]], [[Polypodiopsida]], and [[Psilotopsida]] (Gymnospermae). Their diversity of hosts suggests little or no host-specificity in this group.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; They are found on plants that are non-mycorrhizal as well as plants with known arbuscular, [[ericoid]], orchid, and [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

===Colonization of host plant===
Dark septate endophytes are plant root-colonizing fungi that are often darkly-pigmented, with septate hyphae, and form structures inside plant root cells such as [[microsclerotia]]. However, there is great variation in morphology within this group. Dark septate endophytes are observed more frequently in mature parts of the root system.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt;

There are four main physiological structures of DSE colonization in plant roots. The ''runner hyphae'' are individual, superficial fungal strands following the depressions between epidermal cells. The ''appressorium'' is the swollen structure preceding penetration through a host cell wall. The ''penetration tube'' is the thin structure penetrating through the cell wall. The ''microsclerotia'' are the intracellular groups of hyphae with rounded, thick-walled cells.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; The frequent inter- and intracellular structures suggest that DSE gain nutrition from the plant host.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"/&gt;

==Ecology==

===Interaction with other root-associated fungi===
Dark septate endophytes frequently co-occur with mycorrhizal fungi such as arbuscular, ericoid, orchid, and ectomycorrhiza.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt; There is some evidence that the different root-associated fungi interact. For example, [[ectomycorrhiza]] and DSE strains together increase plant biomass more than either alone.&lt;ref&gt;Reininger, V. and Sieber, T.N. 2013. Mitigation of antagonistic effects on plant growth due to root co-colonization by dark septate endophytes and ectomycorrhiza. Environmental Microbiology Reports 5(6), 892–898&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on host plants===
Effects of DSE on host plants range from [[pathogenic]] to [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], depending on environmental factors as well as both host and fungus genotypes.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"/&gt; However, the majority of DSE studied showed that inoculation of DSE increased total, root, and shoot biomass by up to 80%.&lt;ref name="Newsham2011"&gt;Newsham, K.K. 2011. A meta-analysis of plant responses to dark septate root endophytes. New Phytologist 190: 783–793.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark septate endophyte hyphae are much smaller in diameter compared to plant roots which allows them to access soil micropores unavailable to plants to forage for water and nutrients. Therefore, association with DSE can increase nitrogen and phosphorus content in host plant tissue.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsham2011"/&gt; In arid ecosystems, DSE in the order Pleosporales are commonly found in both rhizosphere soils and surface biological soil crust communities, which suggests that they may aid in nutrient absorption by plants by linking plant roots and biological soil crusts that fix carbon and nitrogen in [[hyphal networks]], which forms the basis of the [[Fungal Loop Hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Porras-Alfaro, A., Herrera, J., Natvig, D.O., Lipinski, K., Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2011. Diversity and distribution of soil fungal communities in a semiarid grassland. Mycologia 103: 10–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The melanized cell walls of DSE may affect heat dissipation or form complexes with oxygen radicals in plant hosts, which can alter host thermal tolerance. Similar to other mycorrhizal fungi, DSE can protect hosts from pathogens or [[herbivores]] through the production of inhibitory metabolites, physical exclusion of other mycroorganisms, or melanized hyphae. Some fungi in the same genus as known DSE are known to produce [[antibacterial]] or [[Fungicide|antifungal]] compounds.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

A '''dilemma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|δίλημμα}} "double [[lemma (logic)|proposition]]") is a [[problem]] offering two possibilities, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The possibilities are termed the ''horns'' of the dilemma, a [[cliché]]d usage, but distinguishing the dilemma from other kinds of predicament as a matter of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199888771 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA257 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemmatic arguments==
The dilemma is sometimes used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Its isolation as textbook material has been attributed to [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] in his work ''On Invention''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Calboli Montefusco, ''Rhetorical use of dilemmatic arguments'', Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric Vol. 28, No. 4 (Autumn 2010), pp. 363–383, at p. 364. Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. DOI: 10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363 {{jstor|10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Peirce]] gave a definition of ''dilemmatic argument'' as any argument relying on [[excluded middle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sujata |last2=Prasad |first2=Sanjiva |title=Logic and Its Applications: 7th Indian Conference, ICLA 2017, Kanpur, India, January 5-7, 2017, Proceedings |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662540695 |page=177 note 5|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=etrJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion, and applied incorrectly, it constitutes a [[false dichotomy]], that is, a [[fallacy]]. Traditional usage distinguished the dilemma as a "horned syllogism" from the [[sophism]] that attracted the Latin name ''cornutus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Sir William |title=The Logic of Sir William Hamilton, Bart |date=1863 |publisher=Moore, Wilstach &amp; Baldwin |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rUEdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original use of the word ''horns'' in English has been attributed to [[Nicholas Udall]] in his 1548 book ''Paraphrases'', translating from the Latin term ''cornuta interrogatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erasmus |first1=Desiderius |title=Paraphrase on Luke 11-24 |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802036537 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q9ZLk_Qw0ZQC&amp;pg=PA158 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In logic==
In [[propositional logic]], ''dilemma'' is applied to a group of [[rules of inference]], which are in themselves valid rather than fallacious. They each have three premises, and include the [[constructive dilemma]] and [[destructive dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Church |first1=Alonzo |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |date=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691029067 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JDLQOMKbdScC&amp;pg=PA105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments can be refuted by showing that the disjunctive premise — the "horns of the dilemma" — does not in fact hold, because it presents a false dichotomy. You are asked to accept "A or B", but counter by showing that is not all. Successfully undermining that premise is called "escaping through the horns of the dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Govier |first1=Trudy |title=A Practical Study of Argument |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495603406 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUxXbUvDiswC&amp;pg=PA254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Dilemmatic reasoning has been attributed to [[Melissus of Samos]], a [[Presocratic]] philosopher whose works survive in fragmentary form, making the origins of the technique in philosophy imponderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harriman |first1=Benjamin |title=Melissus and Eleatic Monism |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108416337 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e091DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with [[Diodorus Cronus]] (died c. 284 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sedley |first1=David |title=Diodorus Cronus |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diodorus-cronus |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxes of [[Zeno of Elea]] were reported by [[Aristotle]] in dilemma form, but that may have been to conform with what [[Plato]] said about Zeno's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=John |title=Zeno of Elea |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral and ethical dilemmas==
{{main|ethical dilemma}}
In cases where two [[moral principle]]s appear to be inconsistent, an actor has a dilemma in terms of which principle to follow. This kind of moral case study is attributed to [[Cicero]], in book III of his ''[[De Officiis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA75 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian tradition of [[casuistry]], an approach to abstract ranking of principles introduced by [[Bartolomé de Medina (theologian)|Bartolomé de Medina]] in the 16th century became tainted with the accusation of [[laxism]], as did casuistry itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Francis E. |title=The words and will of God |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691114617 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=26aSVSICGIEC&amp;pg=PA154 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, with legal roots, is to lay emphasis on particular features present in a given case: in other words, the exact framing of the dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA54 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20896">'''Dynamical systems theory''' is an area of [[mathematics]] used to describe the behavior of the  [[complex systems|complex]] [[dynamical system]]s, usually by employing [[differential equations]] or [[difference equations]]. When differential equations are employed, the theory is called [[continuous time|''continuous dynamical systems'']]. From a physical point of view, continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of [[classical mechanics]], a generalization where the [[equations of motion]] are postulated directly and are not constrained to be [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s of a [[Principle of least action|least action principle]]. When difference equations are employed, the theory is called [[discrete time|''discrete dynamical systems'']]. When the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a [[cantor set]], one gets [[dynamic equations on time scales]]. Some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators, such as [[differential-difference equations]].

Much of modern research is focused on the study of [[chaotic system]]s.

This field of study is also called just ''dynamical systems'', ''mathematical dynamical systems theory'' or the ''mathematical theory of dynamical systems''.
[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] is an example of a [[non-linear]] dynamical system. Studying this system helped give rise to [[chaos theory]].]]

== Overview ==
Dynamical systems theory and [[chaos theory]] deal with the long-term qualitative behavior of [[dynamical system]]s. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible steady states?", or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

An important goal is to describe the fixed points, or steady states of a given dynamical system; these are values of the variable that don't change over time. Some of these fixed points are ''attractive'', meaning that if the system starts out in a nearby state, it converges towards the fixed point.

Similarly, one is interested in ''periodic points'', states of the system that repeat after several timesteps. Periodic points can also be attractive. [[Sharkovskii's theorem]] is an interesting statement about the number of periodic points of a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system.

Even simple [[nonlinear dynamical system]]s often exhibit seemingly random behavior that has been called ''chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grebogi |first=C. |last2=Ott |first2=E. |last3=Yorke |first3=J. |year=1987 |title=Chaos, Strange Attractors, and Fractal Basin Boundaries in Nonlinear Dynamics |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=238 |issue=4827 |pages=632–638 |jstor=1700479 |doi=10.1126/science.238.4827.632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of dynamical systems that deals with the clean definition and investigation of chaos is called ''[[chaos theory]]''.

== History ==
The concept of dynamical systems theory has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]]. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is given implicitly by a relation that gives the state of the system only a short time into the future.

Before the advent of [[computer|fast computing machines]], solving a dynamical system required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could only be accomplished for a small class of dynamical systems.

Some excellent presentations of mathematical dynamic system theory include {{harv|Beltrami|1990}}, {{harv|Luenberger|1979}}, {{harv|Padulo|Arbib|1974}}, and {{harv|Strogatz|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome R. Busemeyer (2008), [http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/Publications/techreps2000/241/241.html "Dynamic Systems"]. To Appear in: ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science'', Macmillan. Retrieved 8 May 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613053119/http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/Publications/techreps2000/241/241.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Dynamical systems ===
{{main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
The [[dynamical system]] concept is a mathematical [[formal system|formalization]] for any fixed "rule" that describes the [[time]] dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each spring in a lake.

A dynamical system has a ''state'' determined by a collection of [[real numbers]], or more generally by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Point (geometry)|points]] in an appropriate ''state space''.  Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers.  The numbers are also the coordinates of a geometrical space—a [[manifold]].   The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state.  The rule may be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] (for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state) or [[stochastic differential equation|stochastic]] (the evolution of the state is subject to random shocks).

=== Dynamicism ===
[[Dynamicism]], also termed the ''dynamic hypothesis'' or the ''dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science'' or ''dynamic cognition'', is a new approach in [[cognitive science]] exemplified by the work of philosopher [[Tim van Gelder]]. It argues that [[differential equations]] are more suited to modelling [[cognition]] than more traditional [[computer]] models.

=== Nonlinear system ===
{{main|Nonlinear system}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[nonlinear system]] is a system that is not [[linear system|linear]]—i.e., a system that does not satisfy the [[superposition principle]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"/&gt; Less technically, a nonlinear system is any problem where the variable(s) to solve for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components. A [[Homogeneity (physics)|nonhomogeneous]] system, which is linear apart from the presence of a function of the [[independent variable]]s, is nonlinear according to a strict definition, but such systems are usually studied alongside linear systems, because they can be transformed to a linear system as long as a particular solution is known.

== Related fields ==

=== Arithmetic dynamics ===
:[[Arithmetic dynamics]] is a field that emerged in the 1990s that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, [[dynamical systems]] and [[number theory]]. Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the [[Iterated function|iteration]] of self-maps of the [[complex plane]] or [[real line]]. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}-adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].

=== Chaos theory ===
:[[Chaos theory]] describes the behavior of certain [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]]s – that is, systems whose state evolves with time – that may exhibit dynamics that are highly sensitive to initial conditions (popularly referred to as the [[butterfly effect]]). As a result of this sensitivity, which manifests itself as an exponential growth of perturbations in the initial conditions, the behavior of chaotic systems appears [[randomness|random]]. This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic]], meaning that their future dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply ''chaos''.

=== Complex systems ===
:[[Complex systems]] is a scientific field that studies the common properties of [[system]]s considered [[Complexity|complex]] in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]]. It is also called ''complex systems theory'', ''complexity science'', ''study of complex systems'' and/or ''sciences of complexity''. The key problems of such systems are  difficulties with their formal [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]]. From such perspective, in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes.

:The study of complex systems is bringing new vitality to many areas of science where a more typical [[reductionist]] strategy has fallen short. ''Complex systems'' is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including [[neurosciences]], [[social sciences]], [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[economics]], earthquake prediction, [[molecular biology]] and inquiries into the nature of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s themselves.

=== Control theory ===
:[[Control theory]] is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]], that deals with influencing the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s.

=== Ergodic theory ===
:[[Ergodic theory]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies [[dynamical system]]s with an [[invariant measure]] and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of [[statistical physics]].

=== Functional analysis ===
:[[Functional analysis]] is the branch of [[mathematics]], and specifically of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], concerned with the study of [[vector space]]s and [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of [[functional space]]s, in particular transformations of [[function (mathematics)|functions]], such as the [[Fourier transform]], as well as in the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations]]. This usage of the word ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' goes back to the [[calculus of variations]], implying a function whose argument is a function. Its use in general has been attributed to mathematician and physicist [[Vito Volterra]] and its founding is largely attributed to mathematician [[Stefan Banach]].

=== Graph dynamical systems ===
:The concept of [[graph dynamical system]]s (GDS) can be used to capture a wide range of processes taking place on graphs or networks. A major theme in the mathematical and computational analysis of graph dynamical systems is to relate their structural properties (e.g. the network connectivity) and the global dynamics that result.

=== Projected dynamical systems ===
:[[Projected dynamical systems]] is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory investigating the behaviour of [[dynamical system]]s where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems and the dynamical world of [[ordinary differential equations]]. A projected dynamical system is given by the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] to the projected differential equation.

=== Symbolic dynamics ===
:[[Symbolic dynamics]] is the practice of modelling a topological or smooth [[dynamical system]] by a discrete space consisting of infinite [[sequence]]s of abstract symbols, each of which corresponds to a state of the system, with the dynamics (evolution) given by the [[shift operator]].

=== System dynamics ===
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behaviour of systems over time.  It deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behaviour and state of the entire system.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163801/http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/ |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].  These elements help describe how even seemingly simple systems display baffling [[nonlinearity]].

=== Topological dynamics ===
:[[Topological dynamics]] is a branch of the theory of dynamical systems in which qualitative, asymptotic properties of dynamical systems are studied from the viewpoint of [[general topology]].

== Applications ==

=== In biomechanics ===
In [[sports biomechanics]], dynamical systems theory has emerged in the movement sciences as a viable framework for modeling athletic performance. From a dynamical systems perspective, the human movement system is a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) that are composed of a large number of interacting components (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle tissue, metabolic enzymes, connective tissue and bone). In dynamical systems theory, movement patterns emerge through generic processes of self-organization found in physical and biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S Glazier, Keith Davids, Roger M Bartlett (2003). [http://www.sportsci.org/jour/03/psg.htm "DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THEORY: a Relevant Framework for Performance-Oriented Sports Biomechanics Research"]. in: Sportscience 7. Accessed 2008-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no research validation of any of the claims associated to the conceptual application of this framework.

=== In cognitive science ===
Dynamical system theory has been applied in the field of [[neurodynamics|neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive development]], especially in [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. It is the belief that cognitive development is best represented by physical theories rather than theories based on syntax and [[AI]]. It also believed that differential equations are the most appropriate tool for modeling human behavior. These equations are interpreted to represent an agent's cognitive trajectory through [[state space]]. In other words, dynamicists argue that [[psychology]] should be (or is) the description (via differential equations) of the cognitions and behaviors of an agent under certain environmental and internal pressures. The language of chaos theory is also frequently adopted.

In it, the learner's mind reaches a state of disequilibrium where old patterns have broken down. This is the phase transition of cognitive development. [[Self-organization]] (the spontaneous creation of coherent forms) sets in as activity levels link to each other. Newly formed macroscopic and microscopic structures support each other, speeding up the process. These links form the structure of a new state of order in the mind through a process called ''scalloping'' (the repeated building up and collapsing of complex performance.) This new, novel state is progressive, discrete, idiosyncratic and unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Promise of Dynamic Systems Approaches for an Integrated Account of Human Development|journal=Child Development|date=2000-02-25|first=Mark D.|last=Lewis|volume=71|issue=1|pages=36–43|id= |url=http://home.oise.utoronto.ca/~mlewis/Manuscripts/Promise.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00116|pmid=10836556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic systems theory has recently been used to explain a long-unanswered problem in child development referred to as the [[A-not-B error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2003-07-30|first=Linda B.|last=Smith|author2=Esther Thelen|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–8|id= |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/labwork/dynamicsystem.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In second language development===
{{Main|Dynamic approach to second language development}}
The application of Dynamic Systems Theory to study [[second language acquisition]] is attributed to [[Diane Larsen-Freeman]] who published an article in 1997 in which she claimed that [[second language acquisition]] should be viewed as a developmental process which includes [[language attrition]] as well as language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/applij/article-abstract/18/2/141/134192|title=Chaos/Complexity Science and Second Language Acquisition|date=1997|publisher=Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article she claimed that language should be viewed as a dynamic system which is dynamic, complex, nonlinear, chaotic, unpredictable, sensitive to initial conditions, open, self-organizing, feedback sensitive, and adaptive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Ecological threshold''' is the point at which a relatively small change or [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] in external conditions causes a rapid change in an [[ecosystem]]. When an ecological threshold has been passed, the ecosystem may no longer be able to return to its state by means of its inherent [[Ecological resilience|resilience]] . Crossing an ecological threshold often leads to rapid change of [[ecosystem health]]. Ecological threshold represent a non-linearity of the responses in ecological or biological systems to pressures caused by human activities or natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;Groffman, P., Baron, J., Blett, T., Gold, A., Goodman, I., Gunderson, L., Levinson, B., Palmer, M., Paerl, H., Peterson, G., LeRoy Poff, N., Rejeski, D., Reynolds, J., Turner, M., Weathers, K., &amp; Wiens, J. 2006. Ecological thresholds: the key to successful environmental management or an important concept with no practical application? ''Ecosystems'' 9(1):1–13. [http://landscape.zoology.wisc.edu/People/Turner/groffman2006ecosys.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Critical load]], [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] and [[regime shift]] are examples of other closely related terms.

== Characteristics ==
Thresholds can be characterized as points or as zones. Zone-type thresholds imply a gradual shift or transition from one state to another rather than an abrupt change at a specific point.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, A. 2005. The concept and utility of "ecological thresholds" in biodiversity conservation. ''Biological Conservation'' 124(3):301–310&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological thresholds have caught attention because many cases of catastrophic worsening of conditions have proved to be difficult or nearly impossible to remedy (also known as points of no return).  [[Ecological extinction]] is an example of a definitive point of no return.

Ecological thresholds are often characterized by [[hysteresis]], which means the dependence of the state of a system on the history of its state. Even when the change is not irreversible, the return path from altered to original state can be drastically different from the development leading to the altered state.

Another related concept is [[panarchy]]. Panarchy views coupled human-natural systems as a cross-scale set of adaptive cycles that reflect the dynamic nature of human and natural structures across time and space. Sudden shifts in ecosystem state can induce changes in human understanding of the way the systems need to be managed. These changes, in turn, may alter the institutions that carry out that management and as a result, some new changes occur in ecosystems.

== Detection ==
There are many different types of thresholds and detecting the occurrence of a threshold is not always straightforward. One approach is to process time series which are thought to display a shift in order to identify a possible jump. Methods have been developed to enhance and localize the jumps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifisc.uib.es/ThEnhancer Thresholds enhancer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720145258/http://ifisc.uib.es/ThEnhancer/ |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecological thresholds, such as clear lakes turning into turbid ones, are well documented but many more are probable to exist. The thresholds database &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resalliance.org/183.php Thresholds database]&lt;/ref&gt; by Resilience Alliance and Santa Fe Institute includes over one hundred examples.

The '''Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematics and Physics''' (ESI) is a research institute located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], whose aim is to stimulate cross fertilization between [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. Named after Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]], it is a part of the [[University of Vienna]] and receives its basic funding from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research.

==Mission==
The purpose of the ESI is to stimulate research in both mathematics and physics by encouraging interaction of leading scientists from both disciplines. This is mainly done by organizing workshops and inviting mathematicians (Fellows) to spend some time (typically one semester) at the institute. Through its natural location in the center of Europe it also aims to foster intellectual exchange between Eastern Europe and the rest of the world.

It has close connections with the Faculty of Physics and the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Vienna.

From 1993 on, the Erwin Schrödinger Institute (ESI) was incorporated as a private association. On Monday, October 25, 2010, the ESI was informed - without prior warning - that its funding by the Austrian Ministry of Science would be terminated effective January 1, 2011. However, taking into account the strong objections of the international scientific community, this decision was reconsidered, with the following result:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~kschmidt/ESI-Webseite.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESI continued operation in its current form until May 31, 2011. On June 1, 2011, the University of Vienna created a `Forschungsplattform' (Research Platform) under the name `Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics'. This new Forschungsplattform now continues the scientific tradition of the Institute - in its current location - and will in particular fund and support the scientific activities approved by the ESI for the years 2011 and 2012. The Ministry of Science has promised funding of the new Forschungsplattform until 2014, and possibly until 2015.

(See also the Form-based section of the [[Zoning in the United States#Form-based|Zoning in the United States]] article.)

A '''Form-Based Code''' (FBC) is a means of regulating land development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle, with a lesser focus on [[land use]], through municipal regulations. A FBC is a regulation, not a mere guideline, adopted into city, town, or county law and offers a powerful alternative to conventional zoning regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form-Based Codes Defined|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/definition|website=Form Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form-Based Codes are a new response to the modern challenges of [[urban sprawl]], deterioration of historic neighborhoods, and neglect of pedestrian safety in new development. Tradition has declined as a guide to development patterns, and the widespread adoption by cities of single-use [[zoning]] regulations has discouraged compact, walkable urbanism. Form-Based Codes are a tool to address these deficiencies, and to provide local governments the regulatory means to achieve development objectives with greater certainty.

==Scope==
Form-Based Codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks. The regulations and standards in Form-Based Codes, presented in both diagrams and words, are keyed to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of development rather than only distinctions in land-use types. This is in contrast to conventional [[zoning]]'s focus on the micromanagement and segregation of land uses, and the control of development intensity through abstract and uncoordinated parameters (e.g., [[floor area ratio]]s, dwelling units per acre, [[Setback (land use)|setback]]s, parking ratios) to the neglect of an integrated built form. Not to be confused with design guidelines or general statements of policy, form-based codes are regulatory, not advisory.

Form-Based Codes are drafted to achieve a community vision based on time-tested forms of urbanism. Ultimately, a Form-Based Code is a tool;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Implementation Tools for Walkable Urban Places|url=http://opticosdesign.com/projects/form-based-code-tools-walkable-urban-places/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of development outcomes is dependent on the quality and objectives of the community plan that a code implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: What Is a Form-Based Code?|url=http://plannersweb.com/2014/12/fbc1/|website=Planners Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Form-Based Codes are part of a long history of shaping the built landscape. Such efforts go back to the urban designs of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], the planning of cities in ancient China, and Roman town planning. The [[Laws of the Indies]], promulgated by the Spanish Crown starting in the 16th century, established some basic urban form requirements for colonial towns in the Americas. [[William Penn]] when planning [[Philadelphia]] in the 17th century did not shy from precise urban form requirements when he said, "Let every house be in a line, or upon a line, as much as may be." {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During the 18th century, Baroque [[urban design]] commonly brought buildings to the fronts of their lots with common facade treatments. [[Baron Haussmann]], appointed by [[Napoleon III]] to oversee the redevelopment of Paris in the 19th century, stipulated precise ratios of building heights to street widths; disposition and sizes of windows and doors on building facades; consistent planting of street trees; and standardization of material colors to bring unity and harmony to the public environment.

===Emergence===
Regulating urban form is a challenge in modern democracies. Design guidelines adopted by municipalities, without legal enforceability, often invite capricious observance, thus failing to produce the comprehensive changes required to produce satisfying public places. When public planning exercises fail to produce predictable results, citizens often rebel against any development. In addition, from early in the twentieth century to the present, attempts at regulating the built landscape have usually been done for reasons that neglect community form, that are more concerned with the uses of property and impacts of scale than the form that development takes.  And a planning profession that in recent decades has focused on policy, neglecting design, encouraged an abstract intellectual response to problems that are largely physical in nature. {{Citation needed|reason=Text includes conclusions without foundation.|date=December 2016}}

The development of modern Form-Based Codes was started by architects, urban designers, and physical planners frustrated by the ineffectiveness of past criticisms of sprawl development and the failure of critics to propose realistic alternatives. These professionals, used to thinking physically about community problems, began the search for systematic physical solutions in the 1970s. Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] published ''A Pattern Language'' in 1977, a compendium of physical rules for designing humane buildings and places. [[Ian McHarg]] developed systematic mapping tools to encourage deliberate development patterns sensitive to local environmental conditions. Traditional Neighborhood Development ordinances were drafted beginning in the early 1990s as sets of development regulations to promote traditional neighborhood forms in new development projects. TND ordinances were typically adopted as an optional regulatory procedure that developers could request in place of conventional zoning . But their design regulations were not mapped to parcels or streets in advance, so lacked predictability of outcomes; TND ordinances proved to be an instructive effort, but showed few results.

Meanwhile, the accelerating scale of worldwide urban growth and the rapid expansion of the extent of cities heightened the need for regulatory tools better equipped to deal with such growth. The first serious attempt at creating a modern form-based code was done in 1982 to guide the development of the Florida resort town of [[Seaside, Florida|Seaside]] by the husband and wife design team of [[Andres Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]]. Realizing that designing an entire town would be an overwhelming task and would in the end lack the visual serendipity that only comes from myriad creative minds at work, they created a design code that established basic physical standards mapped to parcels, and then invited developers and architects to put their own distinctive stamp on their projects—but operating within those standards. The Seaside Code proved very successful; the resulting development of the town of Seaside is widely recognized as one of the most important and appealing planning efforts of the post-World War II era.

Duany/Plater-Zyberk's codes and the work of subsequent form-based code practitioners are not top-down mandates from imperial designers as in the baroque era or the wishful thinking of design guidelines that lack enforceability, but are instead legal regulations adopted by units of local government. As regulations they possess [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]; violators of the regulations can be cited, and their invocation or retraction must go through a legislative process. As such, the community plays a more forceful role in shaping its physical future.

[[Image:FBC-effect-animation.gif|frame|right|Form-based codes produce more consistent and predictable patterns of development in relationship to the public realm than typically achieved through conventional zoning regulations.]]

=== Recent developments ===
Although the Seaside code was commissioned by a private developer, most current codes are commissioned by counties and municipalities. Since Seaside, the scale of Form-Based Coding projects has grown. Form-Based Coding can be applied at many scales, from a two-block main street to a county-wide region. An early Form-Based Code was adopted for downtown West Palm Beach in 1995. A significant code for a major urban arterial, the Columbia Pike in Arlington County, Virginia, was adopted in 2003 (Ferrell Madden Associates). A regional FBC was adopted in 2006 by St. Lucie County, Florida (Spikowski Associates, Dover-Kohl Partners). Duany/Plater-Zyberk has drafted a model FBC that is also a [[transect (urban)|transect]]-based code that can be calibrated for local needs—the [[SMARTCODE]]. Its first attempted customization was done for Vicksburg, Mississippi in 2001 (Mouzon &amp; Greene). The lessons learned there led to the first California adoption of a citywide Form-Based Code for the City of Sonoma in March 2003 (Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates, Moule &amp; Polyzoides), followed on June 16, 2003, by the first SmartCode adopted in the U.S., for central Petaluma, California (Fisher and Hall Urban Design, Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates). SmartCodes are now being calibrated for Miami, Florida and Hurricane Katrina ravaged communities in Mississippi and Louisiana, along with cities as diverse as Taos, NM, Michigan City, IN, Jamestown, RI, Lawrence, KS, New Castle, DE, and Bran, Romania. Planetary climate change that must be mitigated by changes in the human environment will no doubt be an inducement to form-based and transect-based coding in the future.

The Cincinnati Form-Based Code adopted in 2013 is designed to be applied citywide in an incremental way, neighborhood by neighborhood. The code establishes transect zones and specifies standards for transects, building types, frontage types, walkable neighborhoods, and thoroughfares that can be adapted to each neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Form-Based Code|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/codes/cincinnati-form-based-code|website=Form-Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yung|first1=John|title=Here's how Cincinnati's form-based codes are designed to spur redevelopment|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/01/21/heres-how-cincinnatis-form-based.html?page=all|website=Cincinnati Business Courier|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaufort County, South Carolina adopted one of the first multijurisdictional Form-Based Codes at the end of 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starkey|first1=Jackie|title=Beaufort looks to develop different planning method|url=http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_ffd55024-9e95-11e4-916f-83892b1f4c00.html|website=Carteret County News-Times|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beaufort County Eliminates PUDs in Favor of Walkable Neighborhoods!|url=http://opticosdesign.com/beaufort-county-council-votes-9-1-adopt-new-development-code/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the County, the City of Beaufort and the City of Port Royal came together to hire Opticos Design, Inc. in Berkeley, California to draft the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steuteville|first1=Rob|title=Beaufort County, SC, commissions form-based code|url=http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/13617/beaufort-county-sc-commissions-form-based-code|website=Better Cities &amp; Towns|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the growing number of consultants advertising themselves as capable of writing FBCs but with little or no training, in 2004 the non-profit [http://formbasedcodes.org/ Form-Based Codes Institute] was organized to establish standards and teach best practices. In addition, SmartCode workshops are regularly scheduled by PlaceMakers.com, SmartCodePro.com, and SmartCodeLocal.com. In Spring 2014, a new graduate-level studio dedicated to Form-Based Coding was launched at California State Polytechnic University. “Form-Based Codes in the Context of Integrated Urbanism,” is one of the only full courses on the subject in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opticos Goes to School on Form-Based Codes|url=http://opticosdesign.com/opticos-goes-school-form-based-codes/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course is taught by Tony Perez,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Perez, Director of Form-Based Coding|url=http://opticosdesign.com/people/tony-perez/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of Form-Based Coding at Opticos Design; it is expected to be repeated for Spring 2015.

==Components==
Form-Based Codes commonly include the following elements:

* ''Regulating Plan.''  A plan or map of the regulated area designating the locations where different building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical character of the area being coded.
* ''Public Space Standards.'' Specifications for the elements within the public realm (e.g., sidewalks, travel lanes, on-street parking, street trees, street furniture, etc.).
* ''Building Form Standards''. Regulations controlling the configuration, features, and functions of buildings that define and shape the public realm.
* ''Administration.'' A clearly defined application and project review process.
* ''Definitions.'' A glossary to ensure the precise use of technical terms.

[[Image:FBC TypicalComponents.jpg|frame|center|At a minimum, a Form-Based Code, written to enable or preserve a specific urban form, consists of building form and public space standards keyed to a regulating plan. An urban design is the intention or goal, the form-based code is the regulatory tool to achieve it.]]&lt;br /&gt;
Form-based codes also sometimes include:
* ''Architectural Standards.'' Regulations controlling external architectural materials and quality.
* ''Landscaping Standards.'' Regulations controlling landscape design and plant materials on private property as they impact public spaces (e.g. regulations about parking lot screening and shading, maintaining sight lines, insuring unobstructed pedestrian movements, etc.).
* ''Signage Standards.'' Regulations controlling allowable signage sizes, materials, illumination, and placement.
* ''Environmental Resource Standards.'' Regulations controlling issues such as storm water drainage and infiltration, development on slopes, tree protection, solar access, etc.
* ''Annotation.'' Text and illustrations explaining the intentions of specific code provisions.

=== Building Form Standards ===
[[Image:FBC BldgFormStandards2.gif|frame|right|Building attributes that can be regulated in a Building Form Standard, in this case for a hypothetical street in a neighborhood center]]
The types of buildings that make for a lively main street are different from the types of buildings that make for a quiet residential street. Building Form Standards are sets of enforceable design regulations for controlling building types and how they impact the public realm. These Standards are mapped to streets on a Regulating Plan. Building Form Standards can control such things as: the alignment of buildings to the street; how close buildings are to sidewalks; the visibility and accessibility of building entrances; minimum and maximum buildings heights; minimum or maximum lot frontage coverage; minimum and maximum amounts of window coverage on facades; physical elements required on buildings (e.g. stoops, porches, types of permitted balconies); and the general usage of floors (e.g. office, residential, or retail). These regulations are less concerned with architectural styles and designs than in how buildings shape public spaces. If a local government also wishes to regulate the quality of architecture—for example to preserve the historic appearance of a neighborhood—then Architectural Standards should be drafted in addition to Building Form Standards.

=== Public Space Standards ===
[[Image:DPZ SmartCode9 OptionModule ThoroughfareAssemlies Page 21.png|right|thumb|An example of a Public Space Standard for public streets from the SmartCode 9.0]]
Public Space Standards control the physical form of squares, parks, the public right-of-way of streets, and other public spaces. Public spaces are typically under the control of public works, parks, and highway departments. Streets, being the most common public spaces in a community, are the most frequently regulated. Public Space Standards for streets are typically described with dimensioned cross-sections and/or plan views showing travel lane widths, sidewalk widths, street tree and street lamp placement, locations of transit lanes, and the placement of architecture. Plan view diagrams may also be included showing spacing of street trees and lamps, and the radii of the curves of street corners.

==Identification==
How does one determine if a development regulation is a form-based code and a well-crafted one? Form-based codes generally receive affirmative answers to all of the following questions:

* Is the code's focus primarily on regulating urban form and less on land use?
* Is the code regulatory rather than advisory?
* Does the code emphasize standards and parameters for form with predictable physical outcomes (build-to lines, frontage type requirements, etc.) rather than relying on numerical parameters (floor-area ratios, density, etc.) whose outcomes are impossible to predict?
* Does the code require private buildings to shape public space through the use of building form standards with specific requirements for building placement?
* Does the code promote and/or conserve an interconnected street network and pedestrian-scaled blocks?
* Are regulations and standards keyed to specific locations on a regulating plan?
* Are the diagrams in the code unambiguous, clearly labeled, and accurate in their presentation of spatial configurations? &lt;ref&gt;[http://formbasedcodes.org/take-quiz FBCI quiz]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
How are form-based codes incorporated into a local government's development regulations? There are three basic ways:

'''Mandatory codes.''' This is the most common adoption approach. It has the most regulatory  "teeth"—compliance is required. But it is the most ambitious of the approaches, making the new code a seamless part of, or a complete replacement for, the existing zoning ordinance. The form-based code can be adopted as a new zoning district or as an overlay district.

Unique to California and a few other states with appropriate enabling legislation, form-based codes can be contained within a planning document called a "specific plan," which can completely override the zoning ordinance for a given geographic area. Since it stands apart from the zoning ordinance, it can be more creative in its format, giving the coder greater freedom in designing for user-friendliness through page layout, diagrams, and illustrations. Also, the urban design plan and the implementing regulations are bundled together, greatly improving user comprehension. But since the specific plan is not securely integrated within the existing zoning ordinance, it may be more politically vulnerable to retraction.

Example adopted codes:
*''Winter Springs Town Center District Code'', [[Winter Springs, Florida]]
*''Farmers Branch Station Area Form-Based Code'', [[Farmers Branch, Texas]]
*''Central Petaluma Specific Plan and SmartCode'', [[Petaluma, California]]

'''Optional (parallel) codes.''' An optional or parallel form-based code serves as an alternative to, but doesn't replace, a present zoning ordinance. Compliance is voluntary. The developer has the choice of complying with the form-based code or the zoning ordinance, but it must be one or the other. This approach makes sense when compliance with the zoning ordinance is so difficult and time consuming that most development is stymied. Thus a developer has the option of following a form-based code that will streamline and simplify his development process. But, for a local government to maintain two different sets of development regulations for one area is added work which can be significant if the area is extensive. Also depending on the area being regulated, if some developers are choosing the form-based code and others nearby are not, the possibilities for integrated place-making can be compromised.

Example codes:
*''Columbia Pike Form-Based Code'', [[Arlington County, Virginia]]
*''Pike Road SmartCode'', [[Pike Road, Alabama]]
*''Pass Christian SmartCode'', [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]]

'''Floating-zone codes.''' Floating zones are most often written to facilitate master-planned suburban communities and are called PUDs (planned unit developments). However, floating-zone codes are now being written as form-based codes to facilitate urban development. A floating-zone form-based code does not contain a regulating plan but includes instructions and standards for developers to follow when they prepare a regulating plan for their property (e.g. maximum block dimensions, street types, building types, open space accessibility, sidewalk widths.) This distinguishes floating-zone codes from the other two approaches–developers rather than the local government create the regulating plans and the urban designs that they facilitate, but the local government sets the standards. Floating-zone codes allow local governments to establish urban form standards for development without incurring the expense of developing urban design and regulating plans. Developers are given the freedom, within clear parameters, to prepare regulating plans for their property that are likely to meet government approval. A developer submits his or her regulating plan for approval through the rezoning process. Upon rezoning, the floating zone replaces the prior zoning for that property and the regulating plan becomes binding.

Example codes:
*''Miami-Dade County TND District'', [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]
*''Towns, Villages, Countryside Land Development Regulations'', [[Saint Lucie County, Florida]]
*''Flowood SmartCode'', [[Flowood, Mississippi]]
*''Montgomery SmartCode'', [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (not to be confused with the mandatory SmartCode for downtown)

Initially a local government may wish to adopt a form-based code for its entire jurisdiction following one approach, but find this too ambitious with short-term resource and political limitations requiring a more focused effort. Instead it may wish to follow one approach for a smaller area, and then phase in other areas using the same or different approaches as needed. Or a floating-zone code could be adopted for large areas awaiting the public resources coming later that would allow the local government to draft its own regulating plans. Whatever approach is followed—or combination of approaches—simplicity and consistency helps at the permit desk where the code is implemented.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">[[Image:Bacterial growth monod.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1: A bi-phasic [[bacterial growth]] curve.]]

A '''growth curve''' is an [[empirical model]] of the evolution of a quantity over time. Growth curves are widely used in [[biology]] for quantities such as [[population]] size or [[biomass]] (in [[population ecology]] and [[demography]], for population growth analysis), individual body height or biomass (in [[physiology]], for growth analysis of individuals). Values for the measured property can be plotted on a [[graph of a function|graph]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time; see Figure 1 for an example.

==Bacterial growth==
{{Main|Bacterial growth}}

In this example (Figure 1, see [[Lac operon]] for details) the number of [[bacterium|bacteria]] present in a nutrient-containing broth was measured during the course of an 8-hour [[cell growth]] [[experiment]]. The observed pattern of bacterial growth is bi-phasic because two different sugars were present, glucose and lactose. The bacteria prefer to consume glucose (Phase I) and only use the lactose (Phase II) after the glucose has been depleted. Analysis of the molecular basis for this bi-phasic growth curve led to the discovery of the basic mechanisms that control [[gene expression]].

==Cancer cell growth==
[[Cancer]] research is an area of biology where growth curve analysis plays an important role. In many types of cancer, the rate at which [[tumor]]s shrink following [[chemotherapy]] is related to the rate of tumor growth before treatment. Tumors that grow rapidly are generally more sensitive to the toxic effects that conventional [[anticancer drugs]] have on the cancer [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Many conventional anticancer drugs (for example, [[5-Fluorouracil]]) interfere with [[DNA replication]] and can cause the death of cells that attempt to replicate their DNA and divide. A rapidly growing tumor will have more actively dividing cells and more cell death upon exposure to such anticancer drugs.

[[Image:Cancergrowth.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2. Tumor growth curve.]]
In the example shown in Figure 2, a tumor is found after the cell growth rate has slowed. Most of the cancer cells are removed by surgery. The remaining cancer cells begin to proliferate rapidly and cancer chemotherapy is started. Many tumor cells are killed by the chemotherapy, but eventually some cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy drug begin to grow rapidly. The chemotherapy is no longer useful and is discontinued.

==The growth of children==
{{Further|Human height}}
Children who fall significantly below the normal range of growth curves for [[Human height|body height]] can be tested for [[growth hormone deficiency]] and might be treatable with hormone injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Exponential growth==
Some growth curves for certain biological systems display periods of [[exponential growth]]. Typically, periods of exponential growth are of limited duration due to depletion of some rate-limiting resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/population-limiting-factors-17059572|title=Population Limiting Factors {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|'''Higher School Certificate''']]''' (HSC) Economics''' course is a 2-unit elective course undertaken by students in [[New South Wales]] across their final 2 years of schooling. The course includes a preliminary program for study across 3 terms of Year 11, and an HSC course for study over 4 terms of [[Year 12]]. In 2012, 5,262 students sat the HSC Economics external examination, with 12.5% receiving the top performance indicator of a Band 6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/ebos/static/BDHSC_2012_12_15110.html&lt;/ref&gt; The course aims to take a "problems and issues approach" to the teaching and learning of economics, with a particular emphasis on the economic problems and issues experienced by individuals and society.

The key issues of the HSC Economics syllabus are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/economics-st6-syl-from2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic growth 
* Quality of life
* Unemployment
* Inflation
* External stability
* Distribution of income
* Environmental sustainability
== Preliminary course ==

The focus of the Preliminary course is on the practical problems and issues that affect individuals, firms and governments, whilst also introducing core microeconomic and macroeconomic principles to students. The content of the Preliminary Course includes the topics:
* Introduction to Economics
* Consumers and Business
* Markets
* [[Labour markets]]
* [[Financial Markets]]
* Government and the Economy

== HSC course ==

In the HSC course, the problems and issues are studied in relation to the national, regional and global economies, and are in a much higher level of depth. The HSC course consists of four topics (of greater length than in the Preliminary Course). Also included in Topic 1 is a case study of an economy other than Australia, and the impact of [[globalisation]] on that economy, along with economic policies used. The most popular topics for this case study are China, Indonesia, and Brazil.

The four topics studied in the HSC course are:
*[[World Economy|The Global Economy]]
*[[Economy of Australia|Australia's]] Role in the Global Economy
*Economic Issues
*Economic Policies and Management

The HSC examination allows 3 hours and encompasses the following items:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/economics-assessment-reporting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sect I (20 marks): Twenty objective response ([[multiple choice]]) questions mostly examining definitions, basic economic calculations, and the application of basic economic analysis and reasoning skills.

Sect 2 (40 marks): Four short answer questions (in parts, with questions ranging from 1 to 6 marks) examining all parts of the content, sometimes encompassing stimulus material.

Sect 3 (20 marks): Students choose from one of two extended response questions, based on stimulus material provided. Expected length of 800–1100 words.

Sect 4 (20 marks): Students choose from one of two extended response questions. Expected length of 800–1100 words

== Textbooks ==

Three textbooks are updated and published annually, each covering the current 2009 Economics syllabus for the HSC programme:
* Year 12 Economics, Tim Riley (Tim Riley Publications)
* Australia in the Global Economy, Tim Dixon and John Mahony (Pearson Australia)
* Updated Economics (tri-annual publication), John Bulmer (David Barlow Publishing)

The '''Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory''' ('''HURL''') is a regional undersea research program within the [[School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology|School of Ocean and Earth Sciences and Technology]] (SOEST) at [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], in [[Honolulu]].

== Science Dive Program ==
The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory was founded in cooperation with U. S. government's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) in 1980.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/about.html|title=About Us|publisher=Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HURL became a regional center in NOAA’s [[National Undersea Research Program]] (NURP). The University of Hawaii had been donated the submersible ''Makali’i'' (formerly ''Star II''), which launched HURL’s science dive program on July 14, 1981, with its first dive into the Oak Crater in Eniwetok Atoll. This three-month long expedition included scientists from the Defense Nuclear Agency, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and the Air Force Weapons Agency to conduct research on the effects of nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Website. Accomplishments. http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/science/accomplishments.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, they spent nearly 9,000 hours underwater around the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110405_hurl.html|title=Students nationwide virtually participate in Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's 1,000th Pisces submersible dive|date=2011-04-05|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; HURL has facilitated the long-term study of the [[Lōʻihi Seamount|Lo’ihi]] submarine volcano since 1987 and has analyzed its unique ecosystem and documented the growth of this new Hawaiian Island including investigation the collapse event in 1996. In 2005, they conducted a five-month expedition from Honolulu, Hawaii to New Zealand along the Tonga-[[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec]] arc during which they conducted 78 submersible dives and explored 13 different active volcanoes, 12 of which had never been explored before. In 2011, HURL made the first two-sub dive into Lo’ihi’s pit crater for a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary and celebrated 1,000 dives with the Pisces submersibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/hawaii-undersea-dive-110406-1342/|title=Submersible Completes 1,000th Dive Off Hawaii|date=2011-04-06|publisher=OurAmazingPlanet|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cauldron sponge.jpg|alt=Glass sponge collection by the Pisces V submersible.|thumb|Manipulator arm on the ''Pisces V'' submersible collecting a glass sponge.]]
At the end of March in 2012, NOAA zeroed out all funding to HURL and closed down its National Undersea Research Center (NURC, formerly NURP). All program assets owned by NOAA were gifted to the University of Hawaii.  The lab continued to operate on residual funding and on what limited funding that the University of Hawaii could provide. Anticipating this decline in funding, HURL resurrected some of their old technology by placing their Launch, Recovery, and Transport (LRT) back into service. The LRT-12 and the LRT-30a were submersible pontoon barges, that were used from 1981-1996 to launch the ''Makali’i'' and the ''Pisces'' ''V'' respectfully before the arrival of University of Hawaii research ship, ''Kai’imi’kai o’ Kanaloa'' (KOK). By returning to operating of the LRT-30a, the lab was able to reduce their day rate by nearly 70%, thus making them more attractive to potential customers. HURL continued to operate through the 2013 and 2014 dive seasons logging another 46 dives. Maritime Heritage and documentary dives contributed more needed financing, but it was evident that the University of Hawaii would be unable to financially carry the program for any duration without more outside support. By January 1, 2015, nearly all of HURL’s staff had been let go leaving only a few personnel to maintain the two submersibles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;University of Hawai’I Undersea Research Lab@SOEST. HURL in Transition. https://www.unols.org/sites/default/files/201612desap19.pdfhttp://www.kitv.com/story/3144&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, a proposed science expedition to China had emerged, allowing HURL to proceed with its required refit on the ''Pisces IV'' and the addition of more operations personnel. The project was scheduled for March to July 2016. However, after completing their series of test dives and within two days of their scheduled departure, the project was “put on hold” indefinitely due to “increased tensions in the South China Sea”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the fall of 2016, new interest in the submersibles led to the first dives on [[Geologists Seamounts|Cook and McCall Seamounts]] and a return visit to the [[Lōʻihi Seamount|Lo’ihi Volcano]] funded by [[Conservation International]]. This successful exploration was immediately followed by two expeditions funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|Northwest Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain|Emperor Seamounts]] in 2016 and 2017 consisting of 24 and 53 coral survey dives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. HURL Dives 1981 to Present.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Maritime Heritage Discoveries and Ordnance Surveys'' ===
[[File:Japanese mini sub.jpg|alt=Underwater image of the Japanese mini sub involved in the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was first discovered by HURL sunk off the south shore of Oahu.|thumb|Underwater image of the Japanese mini sub involved in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

On December 6, 1984 the submersible ''Makali’i'' came upon a fully intact Douglas SDB-5 Dauntless dive bomber. This aircraft was found 213 m deep off [[Koko Head]], Oahu during a science dive studying deep invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was videoed, surveyed, and subsequently its history was researched. The discovery kick-started a side program within the lab to continue the documenting the wreck sites of the various aircraft, ships, submarines, automobiles, and other miscellaneous remnants of Hawaii’s past that the submersibles encountered. HURL has since surveyed and researched more than 140 such sites. Nearly all of these were found during each year’s 3 preseason test and training dives. A number of these artifacts have been found to be of significant historic value, such as the Ward’s midget submarine and the mysterious “3-Piece” midget submarine that took part in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The giant seaplane “[[Martin JRM Mars|Marshall Mars]]”, the gunboat [[USS Bennington (PG-4)|USS ''Bennington'']], the cable-laying ship [[USS Kailua (IX-71)|USS ''Kailua'']], the Japanese fleet submarines [[I-400-class submarine|I-400]], [[Japanese submarine I-401|I-401]], [[I-124 Japanese submarine|I-124]], and [[I-201-class submarine|I-201]], and several turn-of-the-century Inter-island steamships have also been located and surveyed. Other artifacts discovered include over 25 WWII era landing craft ranging in size from 30’ LVT's to 330’ LST's, various aircraft as early as four 1931 Keystone PK-1 Seaplanes to WWII and [[Korean War]] era military planes to light engine civilian aircraft that went down in the 1980's and 90's.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Aircraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Ships&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60 automobiles have been found that were built from 1917 to the mid-1940's Including military trucks, construction equipment, hand cranked touring cars, and sedans. These vehicles are spread out over a 7 mile span off South Oahu.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2009 HURL began a series of dives off South Oahu under contract with the [[United States Army|US Army]] to conduct an assessment of the chemical weapons disposed at sea after WWII.  The [[Hawaii Undersea Military Munitions Assessment]] (HUMMA) project consisted of 16 dives in 2009 and 14 dives in 2012. Although HURL has observed thousands of pieces of ordnance of numerous types over the past decades, the primary weapon of interest for this project was the M41A2 100-pound mustard gas bombs of which it is estimated that 16,000 were disposed of off Oahu. More than 100 of this particular type of bomb have been observed and several were selected for survey. Samples were collected from the sediment, water, and marine life in the immediate vicinity of these bombs. Other conventional weapons, and areas void of ordnance, were also surveyed for comparison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Salvage &amp; Special Projects'' ===
In addition to its traditional science dive program, HURL has also conducted a number of dives to locate and recover lost vehicles or instruments. This started with the recovery of the ''SeaMarc II'' lost off South Oahu in January 1989.  As of 2015, HURL had recovered eleven items from the deep sea with a 100% success rate. The submersibles have also been chartered by several non-academic organizations for various projects that range from pipeline inspections, sewer outfall surveys, cable route surveys, and numerous television documentaries. In 2011 and again in 2013, the ''Pisces V'' made dives in conjunction with technical divers. The submersible would pinpoint particular sites of interest and deploy a buoy with down line for the divers. This allowed the divers, who had a very limited bottom time, to make the most efficient use of their time on location and conduct operations that required more precise dexterity than the submersible manipulator arms can perform.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Heerema Marine Contractors''' (HMC) is a contractor headquartered in the Netherlands most notable for operation of three of the largest [[crane vessel]]s in the offshore industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hmc.heerema.com/| title=Heerema Marine Contractors| publisher=| accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:HeeremaLeiden2017.jpg|thumb|Current Heerema building (Leiden)]]
Heerema Marine Contractors was formed in 1948 as a small construction company providing oilfield platforms in [[Venezuela]].

In the 1960s the company focused on the North Sea offshore developments. The company developed crane vessels to lift large offshore platforms and modules. The ship shaped crane vessel ''Challenger'' was equipped to lift 800 t.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hmc.heerema.com/About/History/tabid/244/language/nl-NL/Default.aspx |title=History |publisher=Heerema Marine Contractors |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711162255/http://hmc.heerema.com/About/History/tabid/244/language/nl-NL/Default.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for large stable crane vessels to operate in the North Sea environment lead the company to develop the first large [[semi-submersible]] crane vessels. In 1978, HMC commissioned [[Mitsui]] to construct the two sister semi-submersible crane vessels, {{ship|DCV|Balder}} and [[Hermod (ship)|SSCV ''Hermod'']]. These vessel could lift 5,400 tonnes with the twin cranes, and were later upgraded to 8,200 tonnes.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1988 HMC formed a joint venture with [[McDermott International|McDermott]] called HeereMac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/features/fex80557.htm| title=J. Ray McDermott ends HeereMac joint venture| publisher=Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections| date=28 January 1998| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SSCVThialf.jpg|thumb|"Thialf" in a Norway fjord]]
The {{ship|SSCV|Thialf}} was added to the Heeremac fleet, and upon the split of the companies in December 1997, Heerema took ownership of the ''Thialf'', the largest deep water construction vessel and is capable of a tandem lift of 14,200 t (15,600 short tons)

The {{ship|DCV|Balder}} was affected by a flooding incident in 2006 and was put out of service for a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oilpubs.com/oso/article.asp?v1=5979| title=DCV Balder to re-start work in Gulf of Mexico in February| date=12 January 2007| publisher=| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut für Meereskunde''' (IfM, Institute of Marine Sciences) in Kiel, Germany, existed from April 1, 1937 to January 1, 2004. It was an essential element of the long history of marine sciences in Kiel. This history started with the work of [[:de:Samuel Reyher|Samuel Reyher]] published in 1697 and is today continued within the [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="HW15e" /&gt;

==Early history==

Early work in physical/chemical oceanography started with Samuel Reyher, professor at the ''Christian Albrecht [University of Kiel]'' (CAU), when he published his investigation on salinity in the ice-covered Kiel Fjord in 1697.&lt;ref group="p" name="Rey97e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kor94e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mat10"&gt;Wolfgang Matthäus: “Germany and the investigation of the Baltic Sea hydrography during the 19th and early 20th century. In: “Meereswissenschaftliche Berichte”, Warnemünde 2010, 83, S. 1 - 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Other professors of Kiel University followed with work on marine topics. [[:de:Johann Nikolaus Tetens|Johann Nikolaus Tetens]] (1736-1807) studied tides of the North Sea,&lt;ref group="p" name="KortPaffen79e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="PaffenKort84e" /&gt; [[:de:Christoph Heinrich Pfaff|Christoph Heinrich Pfaff]] (1773-1852) studied hydrographic and chemical conditions in the western Baltic Sea,&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Pfaff" /&gt; and [[:de:Gustav Adolf Michaelis|Gustav Adolf Michaelis]] (1798-1848) discussed optical effects in the sea.&lt;ref name="Micha"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BFcHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=gustav+adolf+michaelis+kiel+meer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iZXhwtJRfH&amp;sig=Z0SiNCZnOQ0wpXGihBSt1Suj3a4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj19oHBopLbAhVMJlAKHRoiByAQ6AEIZjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=gustav%20adolf%20michaelis%20kiel%20meer&amp;f=false |title=Ueber das Leuchten der Ostsee nach eigenen Beobachtungen |accessdate=May 21, 2018 | language=German | trans-title=On the shining of the Baltic Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic marine research, however, began only later during the 19th century with biological studies, most notably by the zoologist [[:de:Karl August Möbius|Karl August Möbius]] (1825-1908), the physiologist [[Victor Hensen]] (1835-1924), the marine production biologist [[Karl Brandt]] (1854-1931), and the zoologist [[:de:Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn|Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn]] (1808-1878) who participated in the first of the Danish [[Galathea expeditions]] (1845-1847). The [[:de:Plankton-Expedition|Plankton-Expedition]] in the Atlantic Ocean on the ’’National’’ in 1889 was the beginning of deep-sea expeditions carried out by Kiel scientists.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;

Systematic physical and chemical marine studies also started during the second half of the 19th century. Two people need to be acknowledged in particular. The merchant and industrialist [[:de:Heinrich Adolph Meyer|Heinrich Adolph Meyer]] (1822-1889) from Hamburg managed to  convene a group united by marine research interests. The physicist [[Gustav Karsten]] (1820-1900) from Kiel belonged to this group. A long-term cooperation developed among these two people. Beginning in 1859, Meyer carried out first hydrographic observations in Kiel Fjord and started systematic measurements for the investigation of seasonal changes in the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mat10" /&gt; Meyer received his honorary doctor from Kiel University in 1866.

A major step was the establishment of the “Prussian Commission for the Scientific Investigation of German Seas in Kiel“ (also called the ''Kiel Commission''; in German: ''Preußische Kommission zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung der deutschen Meere in Kiel''). Meyer was a founding member and held the first chair until 1880, with Karsten being his successor until 1896. Möbius and Hensen were also members of the commission. The main objective was the improvement of fisheries. But it became evident soon that this goal could not be reached without an improved knowledge of the hydrography and the development of new approaches and methods. Subsequently the Kiel Commission played an important role in the development of marine sciences in Gemany.&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="KoCu1902" /&gt; A "Laboratory for international marine science" (in German: "Laboratorium für die internationale Meeresforschung") was established by the Commission in 1902. Furthermore, the geographer [[Otto Krümmel]] became professor at Kiel University in 1883,&lt;ref group="p" name="Ko05e"/&gt; strengthening hydrographic work. He wrote the first textbook (2 volumes) on oceanography in German language.&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr07e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr11e" /&gt; The Institute of Zoology and [[Zoological Museum of Kiel University]] became the center of marine biological research, led by [[:de:Adolf Remane|Adolf Remane]] (1898-1976) from 1924 to 1934. In addition, Kiel was the home of outstanding scientists and engineers in marine acoustics as part of industry and navy, in particular [[Alexander Behm]] (1880-1952), Hugo Lichte (1891-1963)&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Lichte1919" /&gt; and [[:de:Karl Heinrich Hecht|Karl Heinrich Hecht]] (1880-1961).

==Institut für Meereskunde==

The University of Kiel decided to concentrate marine sciences within an institution of the university, and the ''Institut für Meereskunde'' (IfM) was founded in 1937.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ge00e" /&gt; Activities of the former laboratories of the Kiel Commission were included in the new institution. The institute had three departments: Biology, Hydrography and Chemistry, and Geology. In addition to disciplinary work, interdisciplinary approaches took root. Studies in the Baltic Sea were supposed to be in the focus, but not exclusively. A building in Kitzeberg on the eastern shore of Kiel Fjord was provided. Remane was director of the IfM from 1937 to 1944. The marine chemist [[:de:Hermann Wattenberg|Hermann Wattenberg]] (1901-1944) became his successor on May 1, 1944. He perished shortly after the appointment on July 24, 1944, together with eight other members of the institute, when bombs destroyed the institute’s building during World War II.

After the end of the war in 1945, work at the IfM already started again in 1946.&lt;ref name="KoCu1946"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanrep.geomar.de/22468/1/1946-1972.pdf |title=Meeresforschung in Kiel 1946-1972|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |language=German | trans-title=Marine research in Kiel 1946-1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Georg Wüst]] (1890-1977) became Professor of Oceanography and Meteorology at the CAU and Director of the IfM. He had been a scientific leader at the former Institute and Museum of Marine Sciences at Berlin University (in German: “Institut und [[:de:Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)|Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)]]“ &lt;ref group="p" name="Kor87e" /&gt; and had mostly performed research on the circulation of water masses in the global ocean and in particular in the deep Atlantic. In Kiel he succeeded in retrieving several earlier members of the institute, getting the permission to use an old villa on the western shore of Kiel as an institute’s building, obtaining the research cutter “Südfall“ and restarting educational programs.&lt;ref name="Erdk51"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25635619 | title=Der Wiederaufbau der deutschen ozeanographischen Forschung nach dem Zusammenbruch im Urteil des Auslandes | language=German | trans-title=The rebuilding of German oceanographic research after the downfall in the judgement of foreign countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; He began research work in the Baltic Sea with a total staff of 15.

After Wüst’s retirement [[Günter Dietrich]] (1911-1972) became his successor. He had been a student at the University of Berlin and had also studied the circulation of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean with Georg Wüst and [[Albert Defant]] at the former Berlin institute. Wüst’s and Dietrich’s experience in deep ocean studies strengthened the orientation of the IfM work towards the open and deep ocean, in particular in physical and chemical oceanography. The IfM became the leading marine research institution in West Germany during those years,&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kr87e"&gt;Wolfgang Krauss: ''Günter Dietrichs Kieler Jahre (1959 - 1972).''[“Günter Dietrich’s years in Kiel (1959 - 1972)“] In: '' Christiana Albertina.'' Neumünster 1987, 24 N.F. S. 43-54.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying on the scientific legacy of the former Berlin institute in research&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; and education.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di57e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di75e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di80" /&gt; Technically, the successor of the earlier Museum of Marine Sciences in Berlin today is the [[German Museum of Technology]] in Berlin.

An important milestone in the IfM’s development was the commission of the new research vessel [[:de:Meteor (Schiff, 1964)|Meteor (Schiff, 1964)]], operated jointly by the German Hydrographic Office (see [[Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany]]) and the German Research Foundation (see [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]. The ship was used by all interested research groups in Germany. The first major expedition 1964/65 to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean was part of the ''International Indian Ocean Expedition''.&lt;ref name="scorIIOE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iioe-2.incois.gov.in/IIOE-2/iioe.jsp |title=About International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German contribution was led by [[Günter Dietrich]] and [[:de:Eugen Seibold|Eugen Seibold]], both from Kiel University, and the majority of scientists and technicians were based in Kiel.&lt;ref group="p" name="Di66e" /&gt; This expedition was the restart of deep-sea oceanography in Kiel.

The financial needs of the IfM were increasing with its tasks and number of personnel, having increased to 124 in the year 1968.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI68e" /&gt; In order to obtain additional funding from the federal and other state governments, the IfM joined the group of “blue list” research institutions (see [[Leibniz Association]] in 1968. New statutes introduced a collegial system, with the acting director being elected for two-year terms by a panel composed of department heads and employee representatives. Although the funding was no longer related to the university budget, strong ties to the CAU prevailed. Professors were selected jointly by the IfM and the CAU.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ad92e" /&gt;

During the following years the IfM became partner in a considerable number of international research programs.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt; A relevant number of IfM scientists worked at foreign research institutions for extended time periods, primarily in the USA. Later a large number of foreign investigators joined the IfM as visiting scientists. The number of employees was increasing steadily.

In the meantime marine geology and geophysics groups had developed parallel to the IfM groups at the CAU. Parts of these activities were combined in the new geoscience institute “Geomar” established in 1987.&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt; At the end of 2001 Geomar had 153 members of staff.&lt;ref name="JBG02"&gt;“GEOMAR Jahresbericht/Annual Report 2001.” GEOMAR Forschungszentrum für marine Geowissenschaften der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel 2001, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the IfM had increased to 252 by that time.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI02" /&gt; With the aim of achieving an increasing collaboration of marine disciplines in Kiel, the “IfM” and “Geomar” joined organizationally to form “IFM-GEOMAR” as part of the “Leibniz Association” on January 1, 2004. The new institution had 389 members of staff at its beginning.&lt;ref name="JBG05"&gt;Andreas Villwock (Ed.): “IFM-GEOMAR Report 2002-2004.” Leibniz-Institut für Meereswissenschaften, Kiel 2005, A-2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to fiscal considerations, IFM-GEOMAR was transferred to an institution of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] on January 1, 2004, thus being primarily funded by the federal government. The name changed to [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].

In addition to Kiel vessels, the IfM staff frequently used all of the larger research ships available in Germany:&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;[[:de:Meteor (Schiff, 1964)|Meteor (Schiff, 1964)]], [[:de:Meteor (Schiff, 1986)|Meteor (Schiff, 1986)]], [[:de:Planet (Schiff, 1967)|Planet (Schiff, 1967)]], [[:de:Sonne (Schiff, 1969)|Sonne (Schiff, 1969)]], [[:de:Polarstern (Schiff)|Polarstern (Schiff)]], [[:de:Maria S. Merian (Schiff)|Maria S. Merian (Schiff)]]).

==Participation in major research programs==

The “German Research Foundation” ([[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]) supported long-term special research programs (SFBs). IfM scientists participated in several of these SFBs, often in a leadership function:&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;

'''''Konsthistorisk tidskrift''''' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[academic journal]] on [[art history]] that was established in 1932 by ''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'' (the Society of Art Historians) in [[Stockholm]]. The journal was published until 1967 under the full title ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift: revy för konst och konstforskning''. Since 2002 it has carried the English alternate title ''Journal of Art History''. It was published by the [[Scandinavian University Press]] from 1992 till 1999, and has been published by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]) since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'',  the Society of Art Historians, was founded in 1914 on the initiative of [[Osvald Sirén]], J. A. Berg Professor of Art History in Stockholm, and [[Johnny Roosval]], then docent of Art History (later professor). The society was clearly Stockholm-centric from the start: Sirén and Roosval became chairman and vice chairman, respectively. The rest of the board consisted of representatives of the major museums in Stockholm, the director of the [[Bukowskis]] auction house there, and the other universities in Lund, Uppsala and Gothenburg each having one representative ([[Ewert Wrangel]], [[August Hahr]] and [[Axel Romdahl]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson (2000), p. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'' had a predecessor in the first periodical of the society, ''Konsthistoriska sällskapets publikation'', which was published 1915-1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistoriska Sällskapets Publikation'']&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, it was absorbed into the journal ''[[Tidskrift för konstvetenskap]]'', which had been published at the [[University of Lund]] since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS], [http://libris.kb.se/bib/408986?vw=full LIBRIS]; Ångström-Grandien (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; At the annual meeting of Konsthistoriska sällskapet in 1931, the board of the Society proposed re-establishing a periodical of its own, as {{blockquote|despite the merits of [Tidskrift för konstvetenskap], it has become apparent that it would be more suitable for the publication of the Society to be edited from Stockholm, as most art historical authors and most members live here, and it must, additionally, be easier to satisfy the interests of art history and the art collectors in all parts of the country with Stockholm as the base.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 123-124. Sjöberg's Swedish summary of the prospect presented by the board: "Sällskapets publikation har under senare åren utgjorts av den i Lund utgivna och redigerade Tidskrift för Konstvetenskap. Trots denna tidskrifts förtjänster har det dock visat sig vara mera lämpligt, att Sällskapets publikation redigeras från Stockholm, då de flesta konsthistoriska författarna och de flesta ledamöterna äro bosatta här, och det dessutom måste falla sig lättare att med Stockholm som utgångspunkt allsidigt tillgodose konstvetenskapens och konstsamlarnas intressen i alla delar av vårt land. Styrelsen har därför planerat en Konsthistorisk Tidskrift av ungefär samma format och omfång som den förutvarande Publikationen. Den nya tidskriften kommer att gratis tillsändas ledamöterna, och årsavgiften för ledamotskap förblir oförändrad."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The journal was to be of approximately the same size as the previous publication and would be distributed to members with no change in fees. After a short debate, the meeting agreed to the proposition of the board. Professor Axel Romdahl from Gothenburg suggested a division of the field between the two journals in some way and offered to negotiate this with representatives of the other journal.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960-1984 annual volumes of the journal included "Svensk konsthistorisk bibliografi" (from 1976 known as "konstvetenskaplig bibliografi"), an annual cumulative bibliography of art history published in Sweden, covering the years 1959-1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lars Olof Larsson and Ingrid Sjöström (1974–1980)
*Götz Pochat and Patrik Reuterswärd (1981:1)
*Patrik Reuterswärd (1981:2–1990)

Since 1992 the person responsible for the journal has been described by the English title "Editor-in-chief" and has been:

*Hans Henrik Brummer (1992–2001)
*Margaretha Rossholm Lagerlöf (2002–2009?)
*The current [[editor in chief]] is Dan Kartholm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/journal.asp?issn=0023-3609&amp;linktype=5 ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'', Editorial Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the journal has and has had a larger advisory committee. The first issue from 1932 listed one consisting of 27 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">A '''ligule''' (from {{Lang-la|ligula}} "strap", variant of ''lingula'', from ''lingua'' "tongue") — is a thin outgrowth at the junction of [[leaf]] and leafstalk of many [[Poaceae|grasses (Poaceae)]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], such as that of a [[ray floret]] in plants in the daisy family [[Asteraceae]].

==Poaceae and Cyperaceae==
[[Image:Ligula.jpg|200px|right]]
The ligule is part of the leaf that is found at the junction of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous ligule can be very short 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Kentucky bluegrass]], ''Poa pratensis'') to very long 10&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Johnson grass]], ''Sorghum halepense''), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a ligule, for example barnyardgrass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'').

A ligule can also be defined as a membrane-like tissue or row of delicate hairs typically found in grasses at the junction of the leaf sheath and blade. The ligule appears to be a continuation of the leaf sheath and encircles or clasps the stem as does the leaf sheath. The three basic types of ligules are: membranous, a fringe of hairs (ciliate), and absent or lacking. Most grasses have ligules, and the shape, length, and appearance of the ligule margin provide consistent characters for separating genera and some species of grasses.

In grass-like plants such as sedges ([[Cyperaceae]]) and rushes ([[Juncaceae]]), ligules are usually absent or poorly developed.

==Asteraceae==
{{See|Ray flower}}
[[File:Ray-floret.svg|thumb|Ligulate floret, typical for flowers of some members of the family Asteraceae:&lt;br/&gt;A. ovary&lt;br/&gt;B. pappus&lt;br/&gt;C. theca&lt;br/&gt;D. ligule&lt;br/&gt;E. style with stamen]]

In members of [[Asteraceae]], a '''ligule''' is the elongated tongue of the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] of a [[ray flower]] or [[ligulate flower]].&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;Sia Morhardt, Emil Morhardt, California Desert Flowers, University of California Press, pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubmosses==
The microphylls of [[Lycopodiophyta]] of the families [[Selaginellaceae]] (spikemosses or lesser clubmosses) and [[Isoetaceae]] (quillworts) have minute, scale-like flaps of tissue called ligules at the base of the upper surface of each leaf blade. This feature distinguishes them from clubmosses of the family [[Lycopodiaceae]].&lt;ref name=Stace&gt;{{cite book|last=Stace|first=C. A.|authorlink = Stace, C.

==History==
The sexual connotations of the phrase "make out" appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase's other meanings of "to succeed". Originally, it meant "to seduce" or "to have sexual intercourse with".&lt;ref&gt;Moe, Albert F. (1966) "'Make out' and Related Usages". ''American Speech'' 41(2): 96–107.&lt;/ref&gt; When performed in a car, it may be euphemistically referred to as ''parking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindeke|first1=Bill|title=The unwritten rules of making out in parks|url=https://www.minnpost.com/cityscape/2015/09/unwritten-rules-making-out-parks|accessdate=16 March 2018|work=MinnPost|date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olsen|first1=Hannah Brooks|title=How to Hook Up in Public|url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2015/09/how-to-hook-up-in-public/407392/|website=CityLab|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century, [[premarital sex]] increased, and with it, petting behavior in the 1920s.{{fact|date=July 2013}} The Continental experience at that time is amusingly illustrated by a letter that [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote to [[Sándor Ferenczi]] in 1931 playfully admonishing him to stop kissing his patients, in which Freud warned lest "a number of independent thinkers in matters of technique will say to themselves: Why stop at a kiss? Certainly one gets further when one adopts 'pawing' as well, which, after all, doesn't make a baby. And then bolder ones will come along who will go further, to peeping and showing – and soon we shall have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of ''demi-viergerie'' and petting parties".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malcolm, Janet. ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 37-8&lt;/ref&gt;

By the postwar period, necking and petting became accepted behavior in mainstream American culture, as long as the partners were dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Breines| first = Wini| title = Young, White, and Miserable: Growing Up Female in the Fifties| publisher = University of Chicago Press  | year = 2001| isbn = 0-226-07261-4| pages= 117–118|quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Making out is usually considered an expression of affection or [[sexual attraction]]. An episode of making out is frequently referred to as a "make-out session" or simply "making out," depending on the speaker's vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Cann, Kate. ''Hard Cash'' (London 2000) p. 262 and p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; It covers a wide range of sexual behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lafollette  | first = Hugh  | title = Ethics in Practice  | publisher = Blackwell  | location = Oxford  | year = 2002  | isbn = 0-631-22834-9  | quote = "making out," which can comprise a rather wide variety of activities  | page = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and means different things to different age groups in different parts of the United States.&lt;ref name = Lief/&gt; It typically refers to [[kiss]]ing,&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt; including prolonged, passionate, open-mouth kissing (also known as [[French kiss]]ing), and intimate skin-to-skin contact.&lt;ref name = Lief/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt; The term can also refer to other forms of [[foreplay]] such as heavy petting,&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"/&gt; which typically involves some [[genital stimulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/heavy%2Bpetting|title=heavy petting - definition of heavy petting in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but usually not the direct act of penetrative [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Crownover  | first = Richard  | title = Making out in English  | publisher = Tuttle Publishing  | location = Boston  | year = 2005  | isbn = 0-8048-3681-7  |quote = "Making out," used in the title of this book is a colloquialism that can mean engaging in sexual intercourse, ...  | page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived significance of making out may be affected by the age and relative sexual experience of the participants. Teenagers sometimes play [[party game]]s in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration. Games in this category include [[seven minutes in heaven]] and [[spin the bottle]].&lt;ref&gt;“Notes From the State of Virginia,” with Wesley Hogan, in First of the Year, vol. II, edited by Benj DeMott (New York:  Transaction Publishers, 2010) p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenagers may have had [[social]] gatherings in which making out was the predominant event. In the United States, these events were referred to as "make-out parties" and would sometimes be confined to a specific area, called the "make-out room".&lt;ref&gt;''From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century'' by Mansour, David. (2005) {{ISBN|978-0740751189}}. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; These make-out parties were generally not regarded as [[Group sex|sex parties]], though heavy petting may have been involved, depending on the group.

'''MAVO''' was a radical Japanese art movement of the 1920s. Founded in 1923, as a re-institution of the Japanese Association of Futurist Artists, the anarchistic artist group displayed an outdoor exhibit in Ueno Park in Tokyo in protest of conservatism in the Japanese art world. The group leader was [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]] (1901 - 1977). The group deployed an interdisciplinary array of performance art, painting, illustration and architecture, to communicate anti-establishment messages to the mainstream. Fueled by responses to industrial development, the MAVO group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art Historian, [[Gennifer Weisenfeld]] has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life.  Other artists involved in the movement include [[Masamu Yanase]], [[Kamenosuke Ogata]], [[Shuzo Oura]] and [[Shinro Kadowaki]], and later [[Osamu Shibuya]], [[Shuichiro Kinoshita]], [[Iwane Sumiya]], [[Tatsuo Okada]], [[Michinao Takamizawa]], [[Kimimaro Yabashi]], [[Tatsuo Todai]], [[Masao Kato]] and [[Kyojiro Haiwara]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisenfeld|first1=Gennifer|title=Mavo: Japanese Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1905-1931|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520223387|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520223387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Yang|title=Russia Constructed: the Practice of Avant-gardism in Taisho-era Japan, 1912-1926|date=December 2009|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/.../1/New_RU_JP_Hayes.pdf|website=osu.edu|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;“Mavoist” artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monskop.org|title=MAVO|url=http://monoskop.org/Mavo|website=Monoskop|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

During the 1923 demonstration, [[Takamizawa Michinao]], one of the members of MAVO, threw rocks in protest, through a glass ceiling of a building housing an exhibition of artworks curated by Nika-kai (The Second Society). Nika-kai was established in 1914 to oppose the conservative [[Bunten]], the governmental Ministry of Education Exhibition. Murayama had spent 1922 in Berlin where he became familiar with the social satire painting of [[Georg Grosz]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s "spiritual" abstract paintings, [[El Lissitzky]]'s constructivist works, and [[Alexander Archipenko]]'s sculptures. As a cultural leader and public figure, Murayama had a confident, flamboyant personality, an androgynous physical presence sporting a bob-hairstyle, and posing for photographs in states of undress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larking|first1=Matthew|title=Mavo, the movement that rocked Japan’s art scene|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2012/04/26/arts/mavo-the-movement-that-rocked-japans-art-scene-2/#.VttW5ulE90A|accessdate=5 March 2016|publisher=The Japan Times|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==

Tatsuo Okada and Tomoyoshi Murayama edited MAVO magazine, that published seven issues between July 1924 and August 1925. The publication included essays on socio-cultural art, poetry, and theatrical texts. The pages included original linocut prints and photographic reproductions of visual art that often appropriated the work of their own members. Reuse and recycling from one project to another was one of the group's trademark strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=Poetry and New Media: An Essay on the 1920's Avant-garde, Focusing on Hagiwara Kyojiro's "Advertising Tower !"  詩と新メディア : 萩原恭次郎の｢広告塔！｣を中心にした一九二〇年代のアヴァンギャルド論考|journal=Comparative Literature and Culture|date=1999|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists' books==

Several members of the group produced short-run artist's books including Hagiwara Kyojiro's ''Shikei senkoku'' (Death Sentence), an anthology of visual poetry published in 1925, and illustrated by MAVO; Ernst Toller's ''Tsubame no sho'', (The Swallow Book) illustrated by Tatsuo Okada and translated by Tomoyoshi Murayama (1925); and Hideo Saito's ''Aozameta douteikyo'',  (The Pale-faced Virgin's Mad Thoughts) visual poetry published in 1926 and illustrated by Tatsuo Okada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisenfeld|first1=Gennifer|title=Mavo's Conscious Constructivism: Art, Individualism, and Daily Life in Interwar Japan|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1996|volume=55|issue=3|pages=64–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Praying Hands at the main entrance to the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to campus and The Billy Joe Daugherty Circle]]
The university was founded by [[Oral Roberts]] in 1965 "as a result of the evangelist Oral Roberts' obeying [[God in Christianity|God’s]] mandate to build a university on God’s authority and the [[Holy Spirit]]. God’s commission to Oral Roberts was to 'Raise up your students to hear My voice, to go where My light is dim, where My voice is heard small, and My healing power is not known, even to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Their work will exceed yours, and in this I am well pleased'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orugoldeneagles.com/downloads2/391722.pdf?ATCLID=1335882&amp;SPSID=87170&amp;SPID=10340&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17000|title=ORU Table of Contents (PDF)|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first students enrolled in 1965.

The school was accredited in 1971 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]] of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.oru.edu/accreditationfacts.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004184134/http://admissions.oru.edu/accreditationfacts.html |date=October 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/oralrobt.asp Member Schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407101739/http://www.ats.edu/member_schools/oralrobt.asp |date=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oral Roberts' son [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard]] was named president in 1993. In October 2007 the younger Roberts took a leave of absence, citing a lawsuit filed by former ORU professors; he resigned the following month. Oral Roberts emerged from retirement to take over as interim president of the university, and Tulsa evangelist [[Billy Joe Daugherty]] was named executive regent.

That same month, the school was reportedly "struggling financially" with over $50 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402111.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103172655/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/24/AR2007102402111.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=November 3, 2012 | title=Chairman Says ORU Over $50M in Debt | publisher=The Washington Post | date= October 24, 2007| first= | last=  | accessdate = 2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORU's operating budget for 2007-2008 was more than $82 million. However, in the second quarter of 2009, the university's debt was reduced to $720,000 as of result of a number of simultaneous efforts including a $70 million gift from the [[Mart Green]] family, owners of [[Oklahoma City]]-based [[Hobby Lobby]], and the $25 Million Dollar Matching Campaign, a part of the university's Renewing the Vision effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?site=oru&amp;id=1058 |title=News Stories - Oral Roberts University - A Christian College, based in Tulsa Oklahoma |publisher=Oru.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 2009, it was announced at the end of the university's chapel service that all of the university's long-term debt obligations had been met and the school was debt-free.&lt;ref name="debt-free"&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ORAL_ROBERTS_DEBT?SITE=OKTUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Oral Roberts says it's debt-free after scandal"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the university's presidential search committee recommended [[Mark Rutland]], President of [[Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God]] in Florida, to officially succeed Richard Roberts, which the Board of Trustees approved. Rutland took office on July 1, 2009 as the third president.&lt;ref name="takesoffice"&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090701_11_0_TULSAO908452 "Oral Roberts University president takes office"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1963–2007 ===
Ground was officially broken for Oral Roberts' university in 1962 in the southern part of the city of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The university received its charter the following year in 1963 from the State of Oklahoma and Oral Roberts University officially opened in 1965 with an enrollment of 300 students and with seven major completed buildings.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"&gt;[http://www.dingman.com/oru_history.pdf "History of Oral Roberts University"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821223800/http://www.dingman.com/oru_history.pdf |date=2010-08-21 }} ''[[Dingman.com]]'' (Tulsa, OK.), May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Oral Roberts placed special importance on the [[Prayer Tower]], even though the concept of a building specifically dedicated to prayer located at the center of the campus caused some considerable tension, as some academic leaders were afraid the school would be unable to receive accreditation with such a building. However, the tower, designed by architect [[Frank Wallace (architect)|Frank Wallace]], was completed in 1967 at a cost of two million dollars, a further source of contention. After the tower's completion, Roberts called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt; At the university's dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was the keynote speaker.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt;

The first partial graduation took place in 1968 and the first full graduation in 1969.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt; In 1971, Roberts announced to the student body that Oral Roberts University had been fully [[accreditation|accredited]] for ten years by the North Central Association, to which the students responded by lifting Roberts off the stage and carrying him around the outdoor assembly amid the cheers of supporters.

During the first decade of the school's existence, enrollment increased at a rapid pace; also during this time, many of the campus' iconic structures were completed, such as the Howard Auditorium, the Graduate Center, the Mabee Center, and Christ's Chapel among others.&lt;ref name="dingman.com"/&gt;

The university built the [[CityPlex Towers|City of Faith Medical and Research Center]] hospital, which opened in 1981, and started the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in 1978,  but severe financial difficulties with both of these institutions led to their closure in 1989.

The [[O. W. Coburn School of Law]] opened in 1979. In 1986 the university "shut down its ailing law school and sent its library to [[Pat Robertson]]'s Bible-based college in Virginia", which subsequently founded the [[Regent University|Regent University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="Scandalspotlight"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/08/scandal_puts_spotlight_on_christian_law_school/?page=full | title=Scandal puts spotlight on Christian law school| publisher=Boston Globe | date= April 8, 2007| first=Charlie | last=Savage  | accessdate = 2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Golden Eagle Broadcasting ====
{{Main|Golden Eagle Broadcasting}}
In January 1996 Golden Eagle Broadcasting, a small digital satellite Christian and family programming television network owned and operated by Oral Roberts University, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20100623_geb_signs_distribution_deal_with_directv.php|title=ORU’s Golden Eagle Broadcasting Signs Distribution Deal with DIRECTV|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming includes the Oral Roberts University Chapel Service, called ''The Gathering,'' ORU sports, and other Christian programs not associated with ORU.

{{wikinews|Oral Roberts University president accused of illegal political donations and financial misappropriation}}
In October 2007, a lawsuit was filed in Tulsa County by three former professors who claimed to have been wrongfully terminated. They also alleged university president Richard Roberts misused university assets and illegally ordered the university to participate in Republican candidate Randi Miller's political campaign for Tulsa mayor. This occurred while the tax-exempt university was working lawfully with the [[Republican National Committee]] on out-of-state projects as part of a long-standing, pre-approved curriculum that had been in place for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=/daily/2007/10/2007100303n.htm |title=3 Former Professors Sue Oral Roberts U., |accessdate=2007-09-24 |author=  |date=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/Swails_vs_ORU.pdf |title=Swails, Brooker, Brooker v.

Lindsay Roberts, who is referred to in ORU publicity as the university's "first lady," is accused of spending tens of thousands of dollars of university funds on clothes, awarding nonacademic [[scholarship]]s to the children of family friends and sending text messages, mostly sent between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., on university-issued cell phones to people described in the lawsuit as "underage males."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The lawsuit also alleges a longtime maintenance employee was fired for the purpose of giving the job to an underage male friend of Lindsay Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/Swails_vs_ORU.pdf |title=Swails, Brooker, Brooker v.

Richard Roberts told students during his weekly chapel, "This lawsuit ...is about intimidation, blackmail and extortion." Former ORU professor and lawsuit plaintiff Tim Brooker commented, "All over that campus there are signs up that say, 'And God said, build me a university, build it on my authority, and build it on the Holy Spirit.' Unfortunately, ownership has shifted."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501436.html Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts]'', 6 October 2007, retrieved 8 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Church of Christ]] minister [[Carlton Pearson]], a former protege of Oral Roberts, said Richard Roberts was "born into privilege... What others may call extravagance he may not see it as extravagant." According to CNN, Pearson said he was disappointed but not surprised by the allegations, explaining, "These kinds of things are common among family-owned and operated businesses and ministries. They don't cross every T and dot every I."&lt;ref&gt;CNN, ''[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/10/10/oru.suit/?iref=mpstoryview Oral Roberts' son denies he misspent school funds]'', 10 October 2007, retrieved 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Wikipedia's disambiguation page.                           --&gt;
On October 12, the plaintiffs filed an amended lawsuit adding the university's Board of Regents (Oral and Richard Roberts, along with [[George Pearsons]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Creflo Dollar]], [[Michael Armand Hammer|Michael A. Hammer]], [[John Hagee]], [[Marilyn Hickey]], [[Jerry Savelle]] and [[Charlie Watson|Charles Watson]]) to the suit and alleging three days after the original lawsuit was filed, Roberts fired the university's financial comptroller (who had been employed by ORU for 26 years) and "witnesses have reported voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence." The filing also alleged Lindsay Roberts had spent at least nine nights in the ORU guest house with an underage 16-year-old male who also was allowed to live in the Roberts family residence on campus, a situation that made their oldest daughter so uncomfortable, she insisted deadbolt locks be installed on all bedroom doors in the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/pdfs/orusuit.pdf Online copy of revised Swails lawsuit against ORU, October 12th, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written response to the later allegations Lindsay Roberts said, "I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply. Allegations against me in a lawsuit yesterday are not true. They sicken me to my soul." In a separate written statement the university denied "purposely or improperly" destroying documents.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071013_1__OralR22105 Lindsay Roberts, ORU deny latest claims]'', 13 October 2007, retrieved 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resignation of Richard Roberts ====
{{wikinews|Richard Roberts takes leave of absence from Oral Roberts University}}
On October 17, 2007, Richard Roberts announced a "temporary leave of absence" as president of the university, citing the "toll" the lawsuit and attendant allegations have taken on him and his family. Billy Joe Daugherty became Executive Regent of the Board of Regents and Interim President. Chairman of the Board [[George Pearsons]] noted the temporary resignation was not an admission of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071018_1_A1_hTheO62814 Roberts takes ORU leave]'', 17 October 2007, retrieved 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, former board of regents member Harry McNevin claimed that during the 1980s, the ORU Board of Regents "rubber-stamped" the "use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; McNevin also said a country club membership was purchased for Oral Roberts' home. "His idea was if he could get on the golf course with these people, he could get donations for the university," said McNevin. These lavish expenses led McNevin to resign from the board in 1987.

In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the university on November 21, 2007, former ORU senior accountant Trent Huddleston claimed he had been ordered to help Roberts and his wife "cook the books" by misclassifying nearly $123,000 in funds allegedly spent by the university on remodeling the Roberts home.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, November 21, 2007, "[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8T2BTUO0 Oral Roberts Accountant Sues Over Firing]," Associated Press. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061040/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8T2BTUO0 |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Oral Roberts calls 'emergency meeting'}}
On November 13, the tenured faculty of Oral Roberts University approved by a simple majority a non-binding vote of no confidence in Richard Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;AP, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/education/14oral.html Faculty Opposes Oral Roberts President]'' 13 November 2007, retrieved 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts tendered his letter of resignation to the university's board of regents on November 23, effective immediately. In a prepared email statement released by the university, he said, "I love ORU with all my heart. I love the students, faculty, staff and administration and I want to see God's best for all of them." The regents said they would meet the following week to discuss the search for a new president. Executive regent Billy Joe Daugherty continued as interim president (working with chancellor Oral Roberts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071124_1_A1_hMove11578 Roberts resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

"You can't take the sacrifices of God's people and use them any old way," McNevin commented after Roberts' resignation. "It's been 20 years that they've been doing the same things that I became aware of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/11/23/national/a165630S41.DTL Embattled Oral Roberts President Resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, Pearsons said the university planned to separate its finances and leadership from the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, to the apparent approval of many students and faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;AP, Justin Juozapavicius, ''[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20071129/D8T75O201.html Roberts Says God Forced His Resignation]'', 29 November 2007, retrieved 29 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2008 ORU settled with lawsuit plaintiff John Swails who was reinstated to his previous teaching position.&lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080111_1_A1_hThel03342 ORU reinstates one professor]'', tulsworld.com, 11 January 2008, retrieved 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080502/ap_on_re_us/oral_roberts_scandal ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503141315/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080502/ap_on_re_us/oral_roberts_scandal |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also announced a formal search committee for a new president, to be headed by board of regents member and Tulsa resident Glenda Payas.&lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080110_1_A9_spanc51273 ORU regent to lead committee structuring presidential search]'', tulsworld.com, 10 January 2008, retrieved 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–present ===
On January 14, 2008, Oral Roberts University’s board of regents voted unanimously to accept $62 million from the [[Mart Green]] family, founders of [[Hobby Lobby]] and Mardel educational and Christian supply stores. In late October, an ORU spokesman had said ORU was $52.5 million in debt and the school accepted an unconditional $8 million from the Greens in late November. ORU’s board of regents has been replaced with a 23-member board of trustees all initially named by the Greens, with Mart Green as chairman. Although Green said in November, two family members would sit on the board, he will reportedly be the only one. Green said he wanted to be involved in ORU because his family “felt like financial stewardship needed to be shored up.” &lt;ref&gt;Marciszewski, April, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080115_1__hThea88026 "$62 million for ORU,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', 15 January 2008, retrieved 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campus renovations and layoffs ====

Of the $82 million given to Oral Roberts University, around half went toward eliminating the university's $52 million debt. The remaining $32 million was allocated to, "campus renovations, technology upgrades, academic enhancement, financial aid for new and returning students, marketing and operations," according to the university website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=821|title=Renewing the Vision|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2008, $10 million went toward campus upgrades and deferred maintenance. Many of the dormitories on campus received extensive renovations and most of the campus's other buildings received much needed restoration and upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?intNav=news&amp;id=916|title="Summer Renovations Recap 2008,"|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prayer Tower on the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Prayer Tower]].]]

In January 2009, the University began to implement the employment reduction plans announced in November 2008, laying off 53 employees and cutting about 40 unfilled positions. According to university sources, these layoffs come as the administration and Board of Trustees seeks long-term financial viability for the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20090113_330_0_ORUemp571078 "ORU cuts positions, 53 laid off,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2009, it was announced that the Green family would commit an additional $10.4 million to go toward additional campus renovations and upgrades to take place during summer 2009.&lt;ref name="oru.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=991&amp;intNav=|title=Green Family Commits $10 million for Summer Renovations,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the gift, Mart Green, who is chair of ORU's board of trustees, said, "This gift will help to improve the quality of education for students at the new ORU. Our family is excited to continue partnering with ORU financially to ensure this great university continues to provide an excellent, whole-person education." &lt;ref name="oru.edu"/&gt;

==== ''Renewing the Vision'' campaign ====
Following Mart Green's contribution, the university's debt was reduced to $25 million. In February 2008, the Renewing the Vision campaign was initiated in an effort to erase this debt. To free the university from its burgeoning debt, the Board of Trustees announced plans for a $25 million matching campaign,&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/news_stories.php?id=821|title=Renewing the Vision,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Board agreed that it would match dollar-for-dollar all that was donated to the university as part of the Renewing the Vision campaign, up to a maximum of $25 million. ORU Interim President Ralph Fagin stated, "The goal is in one year to get the debt down. It is a pretty audacious goal. It is a faith goal."&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"/&gt; In addition to eliminating the debt, funds from the Renewing the Vision campaign contributed to the 2008 summer campus renovations as well as scholarships provided by the university.&lt;ref name="Renewing the Vision"/&gt; As of June 3, 2009, donations and pledges had reduced the university's original $50 million debt to $720,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webapps.oru.edu/secure/alumniweb/renewingthevision_bf.php|title=Renewing the Vision,|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2009, a $1 million donation was made to the school's Whole Person Scholarship fund by Chairman of the Armand Hammer Foundation and university trustee [[Michael Armand Hammer]], son of Julian Armand Hammer and grandson of the late industrialist [[Armand Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Sept_1/ai_55623393/|title=Oklahoma: Trustee gives $1 million to ORU scholarship fund|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer's donation will be matched twice and, in the end, will amount to a $4 million donation to the university. The donation will contribute to a new scholarship initiative that seeks to find potential students who are well-rounded and already exhibit the characteristics of a person who is spiritually alive, intellectually alert, physically disciplined, and socially adept. The Whole Person Scholarship provides scholarships that vary from full-tuition down to $2,500 to students who meet the aforementioned criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wholeperson.oru.edu/purpose.php|title=Whole Person Scholarship|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312082556/http://wholeperson.oru.edu/purpose.php|archivedate=12 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presidential inauguration of Mark Rutland and debt-free status ====
In January 2009, it was reported that ORU had selected a new president: [[Mark Rutland]], president of [[Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God|Southeastern University]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20090114_296_0_OralRo301798 "ORU has candidate for president,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, Rutland confirmed that he had been offered the position, and intended to accept it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20090114/NEWS/901140413/1410?Title=Oral_Roberts_Courts_Southeastern_s_Rutland|title=Oral Robert Courts Southeastern's Rutland,|work=TheLedger.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rutland was formally announced as the new president on January 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Muchmore, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090129_11_A9_MarkRu182765  "New ORU president named,"] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  He officially took office on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="takesoffice" /&gt;

On September 23, 2009, at the university's twice-per-week chapel service, President Mark Rutland announced that all of the university's long-term debt obligations had been met and the school was now debt-free.&lt;ref name="hosted.ap.org"&gt;Justin Juozapavicius [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ORAL_ROBERTS_DEBT?SITE=OKTUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "Oral Roberts says it's debt-free after scandal"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Associated Press]], September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland had indicated in an interview earlier in the year that he had expected the announcement for quite some time and that he could have paid the debt down when he took office in July, "But that's like making a hole in one with nobody on the golf course." He told the Associated Press, "So, we're going to wait until school starts ... and then we'll have a 'ta-dah' moment."

About the erasing of the university's debt, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Mart Green said, "We are extremely thankful to all the donors who stepped up to support ORU. They know the value of this university and they can see the product that ORU produces – excellent, whole-person graduates who are valuable to this community and to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20090923_oru_eliminates_longterm_debt.php|title=Free at Last: Oral Roberts University Eliminates Long-term Debt|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations from alumni contributed heavily to the university becoming free: prior to the 2007 scandal, less than 6 percent of alumni donated to the university; however, as a result of the ''Renewing the Vision'' campaign, donations from alumni rose from $763,000 in 2007 to $2.3 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="hosted.ap.org"/&gt;

The announcement was made two days before the September 25, 2009, [[inauguration]] ceremony for Rutland held at the [[Mabee Center]] on the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=11197038|title=Dr. Mark Rutland Becomes ORU's Third President|date=25 September 2009|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ceremony of its kind in ORU's history, it was attended and addressed by many dignitaries and guests, among them [[Kathy Taylor]], the mayor of Tulsa, and [[Marilyn Hickey]], former member of the ORU Board of Regents. [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] [[Brad Henry]] declared September 25, 2009, "Dr. Mark Rutland Day". At the ceremony, Rutland received a blessing from the founder and chancellor of the university, Oral Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090926_11_A1_MarkRu117184 "ORU inaugurates leader"] [[Tulsa World]], September 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ORU announced that the Green family would make another $10 million gift in 2011, to be used for renovations and technology improvements.  The gift raised the Greens' total donations to $110 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Sherman, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=19&amp;articleid=20101217_11_0_TheGre168553 "ORU receives another $10 million donation"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', December 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2013, ORU announced that [[Billy Wilson (pastor)|William "Billy" Wilson]], executive director of the International Center for Spiritual Renewal and vice-chair of the ORU board of trustees, had been selected to succeed Rutland as president, effective on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Leclaire, [http://www.charismanews.com/us/38055-oru-names-billy-wilson-as-fourth-president " ORU Names Billy Wilson as Fourth President"], ''[[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma News]]'', January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A day earlier, the ORU student newspaper had briefly posted an erroneous report on its website, mistakenly identifying a different person as the new president. Rutland criticized the report at a student assembly and the newspaper's longtime faculty adviser left the school the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Paluka, [https://archive.is/20130216021409/http://www.fox23.com/mostpopular/story/ORU-professors-exit-causing-stir-on-campus/ChbU85RFZEyMoHxPa_vtsg.cspx "ORU professor's exit causing stir on campus"], [[KOKI-TV]], January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus life ==

[[Image:Entrance sign at Oral Roberts University (1974).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Entrance sign at ORU in 1974]]

The university's residential policy requires all unmarried undergraduate students who are younger than 25 to live on campus, although exceptions are made for those students who live with their parents within the Tulsa area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oru.edu/admissions/undergraduate/pdfdocs/intl_application.pdf "Undergraduate Application: Residential Policy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527180451/http://www.oru.edu/admissions/undergraduate/pdfdocs/intl_application.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }} ''Oral Roberts University'', September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women are housed in separate dormitory facilities on campus with student access to housing of the opposite sex largely restricted. In addition to having a chaplain on every "wing" of each dormitory, there are also Residential Advisers for each floor, who enforce curfew, take attendance at Chapel services, and serve as "go-to persons" for students living on their floors. As well, each floor has an Academic Peer Adviser (APA) who serves to offer or facilitate tutoring services to students who need assistance with their studies; the APA also keeps students informed of academic news and obligations. Every Monday night is a mandatory Hall Meeting at which announcements are made by dorm leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/alumni_and_friends/alumni/media/enewsletters/200901.php "Alumni Newsletter"] ''Oral Roberts University'', September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student codes ===
All students are required to sign a pledge stating they will live according to the university's [[honor code]]. Prohibited activities include [[lie|lying]], [[Profanity|cursing]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]], and a range of [[Human sexuality|sexual acts]] including [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior and sex outside marriage.&lt;ref name="Oral Roberts University 2009"&gt;[https://webapps.oru.edu/slle/code-of-honor-pledge.pdf "Honor Pledge"] ''Oral Roberts University'', September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2003, the student [[Social aspects of clothing|dress code]] was relaxed for the first time in 40 years and described as [[business casual]]. For most of the school's history, men were required to wear collared shirts and ties, while women were required to wear skirts (an exception for winter months was added in 2000). In 2006, campus-wide dress code rules were eased further, allowing students to wear jeans to class and dress more casually in non-academic settings. Since 2009, men are allowed to have neatly trimmed facial hair. Restrictions on men concerning hair length were relaxed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.oru.edu/flash_flipbooks/student_handbook/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumniweb.oru.edu/oru%20alumni/right74.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902221931/http://alumniweb.oru.edu/oru%20alumni/right74.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-02 |title=Ties and Skirts: Addressing the Issue |accessdate=2006-06-29 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=ORU:Alumni Foundation |pages=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chapel ===

The university has weekly chapel services in Christ's Chapel, which are recorded and broadcast live through the university's television station and also via satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golden-eagle-tv.com/shows/chapel.html "Enter In (formerly ORU Chapel"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904051115/http://www.golden-eagle-tv.com/shows/chapel.html |date=September 4, 2009 }} ''Golden Eagles Broadcasting'', September 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The television broadcast, called "ORU Alive," is directed from the television studios in the [[Mabee Center]] while the cameras and sound equipment are manned by students.

A typical chapel service features [[contemporary worship]], a missions offering, special music, and a [[sermon]], typically from the President of the University, Dr. [[Billy Wilson (academic)|William Wilson]], as well as special guests, including some of the world's biggest and most well-known pastors, evangelists, and spiritual leaders. Attendance at Chapel is mandatory and attendance is taken by student leadership.&lt;ref name="Oral Roberts University 2009"/&gt;

=== Futuristic architecture ===
[[Image:Learning Resource Center - Graduate Center on the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|right|Main campus building, the Learning Resource and Graduate centers]]
The campus was built beginning in 1963 with a noted [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] look and architecture. Architects Stanfield, Imel &amp; Walton of Tulsa designed the 1963 master plan but most of the buildings were designed by Tulsa architect Frank Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsahistory.org/events/deco_tours.htm Tulsa Historical Society Art Deco Tours 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704182647/http://www.tulsahistory.org/events/deco_tours.htm |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as "sculptures", noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was "whittling since I was a kid".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Evatt, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=32&amp;articleid=20100929_32_E1_CUTLIN175896 "ORU architect's home to be auctioned"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the buildings may have been inspired by Tulsa's [[art deco]] architectural heritage&lt;ref&gt;For more detail regarding Tulsa's art deco heritage, see [[List of Art Deco buildings in Tulsa, Oklahoma]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderntulsa.net/index.php/archive/oru-tulsa-oral-roberts-university-oral-roberts-architecture-modern-university-modern-architecture|title=''Modern Tulsa'' blog archive for ORU|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201164639/http://www.moderntulsa.net/index.php/archive/oru-tulsa-oral-roberts-university-oral-roberts-architecture-modern-university-modern-architecture|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Bruce Goff]]'s individualistic style and creative use of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=44&amp;homepageid=36 "A Century of Structures,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010060353/http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=44&amp;homepageid=36 |date=2007-10-10 }} from ''Oklahoma Magazine'' (retrieved 18 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 the campus was described as "a perfect representation of the popular modernistic architecture of the time... the set of ''[[The Jetsons]]''" but also "shabby" and "dated, like [[Walt Disney|Disney's]] [[Tomorrowland]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Justin Juozapavicius, Associated Press, ''[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8S38PR80 Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts U.]'', 5 October 2007 retrieved 7 October 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040106/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9XJtq8scoszIFZLWUjrR8mPuBFQD8S38PR80 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hts11eOY7H11NnIWiVKcH4wZJt2QD8SPM0OO0 |title=Oral Roberts' Son Accused of Misspending |agency=Associated Press |date=November 8, 2007 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111161744/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hts11eOY7H11NnIWiVKcH4wZJt2QD8SPM0OO0 |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle's Case Studies, ''[http://www.carlisle-syntec.com/index.cfm?act=case_study_detail&amp;Press_ID=523 Oral Roberts University Fights Back with Help from Carlisle SynTec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195328/http://carlisle-syntec.com/index.cfm?act=case_study_detail&amp;Press_ID=523 |date=2007-10-12 }}'' 19 March 2007, retrieved 07 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance of the many unique but aging buildings, structures and architectural details on campus was cited as a growing problem for the university.&lt;ref&gt;Lost Tulsa, ''[http://www.losttulsa.com/2006/02/oral-roberts-university-in-decay-as.html Oral Roberts University in Decay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184010/http://losttulsa.com/2006/02/oral-roberts-university-in-decay-as.html# |date=2007-10-12 }}', 10 February 2006, retrieved 07 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, $10 million was set aside from [[Mart Green|Green]] family donations for long deferred maintenance on many campus buildings, along with the prayer tower.

[[Image:Howard Prayer Tower.jpg|thumb|Howard Auditorium and the Prayer Tower (the gas flame at the top of the tower is barely visible in this photograph)]]
The front entrance onto campus is a divided, landscaped roadway, originally called The Avenue of Flags and now renamed Billy Joe Daugherty circle, lined with lighted flags representing the more than 60 nations from which ORU students have been drawn.

The main academic building is the John D. Messick Learning Resource Center / Marajen Chinigo Graduate Center, an immense 900,000 square foot (80,000 m²) facility with many pylon-like columns, gold-tinted windows and a [[lozenge]] shaped [[Surface area|footprint]] that university publicity says was styled after [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's Temple]]. The Howard Auditorium is a gold, [[Buckminster Fuller]] style geodesic dome that is used for movies, theatre productions, classes and seminars. Bi-weekly university chapel services are held in Christ's Chapel, a 3,500 seat building constructed in drape-like fashion as an echo of Oral Roberts' early tent [[Revivalism|revivals]]. The [[Googie]] style [[Prayer Tower]] at the center of campus was intended to resemble "an abstract [[Christian cross|cross]] and [[Crown of Thorns]]" and also houses a [[visitor center]]. The [[Mabee Center]] is an 11,000 seat arena on the southwestern edge of campus and is used for basketball games, concerts, church services and satellite television productions. Timko-Barton Hall houses musical and theatrical performance halls as well as classrooms devoted to the university's programs in the performing arts. The building's performance halls are often the scene of concerts and recitals by performing arts students.

The [[Kenneth H. Cooper]] Aerobics Center houses basketball courts, an elevated running track, a free-weights and exercise room, a swimming pool and classrooms for students who are enrolled in [[Health Fitness|health fitness]] courses (a requirement for all students). J.L. Johnson Stadium is a 2,200 seat baseball stadium located on the north of the campus.

The [[Armand Hammer]] Alumni-Student Center was designed by KSQ Architects, PC, and constructed and completed in 2013. It is the first building to be built on the ORU campus in decades. It totes the largest TV in Oklahoma, a "living room" for students, a gaming center equipped with [[Wii]]'s and [[Xbox]]'s, pool tables, ping pong, and more. The building is a modern design fitting for the campus. Students also enjoy addition restaurants and a coffee shop. The Armand Hammer Student-Alumni Center also houses student government offices as well as board rooms for special meetings. No classes meet in this building; it is strictly for the use and enjoyment of the student body.

The Hamill Student Center is located between Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts Halls and houses restaurants on its lower level. Zoppelt Auditorium is located on the ground level and is often used as a lecture hall for classes, forums and special events. Campus Security and the "Fireside Room" are also on ground level with the university cafeteria (called "Saga" by students) on the upper level.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"&gt;Student Handbook ''[http://www.oru.edu/catalog/ORU_hb0203.pdf Student Handbook Fall 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165525/http://www.oru.edu/catalog/ORU_hb0203.pdf |date=2008-05-17 }}'' retrieved 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Housing ====
There are eight dormitories on campus.

* '''Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall''' is a seven-story building built in 1965 that can house up to 600 women.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; Called "Claudius" by students, the building is named after Oral Roberts' mother.
* '''Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall''' is a seven-story building also built in 1967 that can house up to 600 men.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; Called "EMR" by campus residents, this dormitory is similar to Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall but has some differences, notably walls made of concrete blocks rather than sheetrock, two elevators instead of one and laundry facilities located in the basement instead of every floor. According to the university, these two tri-winged buildings are meant to reflect the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;About ORU: [http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/emr.php Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall &amp; Claudius and Priscilla Roberts Hall] retrieved 3 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113618/http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/emr.php |date=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Towers Dormitories.jpg|thumb|right|The four "Towers" residence halls, Michael Cardone, Wesley Leuhring, Susie Vinson and Frances Cardone.]]
* '''Frances Cardone Hall''' (originally named Ethel Hughes Hall) is a twelve-story building for housing up to 372 women.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; This is one of the four "Towers" dormitories, which are meant to represent the [[Star of David]].&lt;ref&gt;About ORU: [http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/towers.php Towers] retrieved 3 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084514/http://www.oru.edu/aboutoru/towers.php |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is called "Frances" by university students.
* '''Michael Cardone, Sr. Hall''' (originally named Edward Hughes Hall) is the twin dormitory to Frances and houses up to 372 men.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; It is linked to the three other Towers dormitories by a central hallway and the main lobby area, called the "Fishbowl" for its glass exterior walls.
* '''Susie Vinson Hall''' is one of two shorter "Towers" housing 244 women on eight stories and known as "Susie."&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt;
* '''Wesley Leuhring Hall''', called "Wesley" by students, is the twin dormitory of "Susie" and is much alike in both capacity and design.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt; In the summer of 2017, Wesley was converted into a women's dorm and was to be called "Susie South."
* '''Gabrielle Christian Salem Hall''' is a three-story split-level dormitory located west of Timko-Barton Hall and called "Gabby" by the students. It can house up to 240 women and has secured doors that open using university issued cards. There are in-room bathroom facilities on the first and second floors.&lt;ref name="Student Handbook Fall 2008"/&gt;

The university has strict guidelines concerning student access to the upper floors of residence halls by members of the opposite sex, which is limited to designated occasions called "Open Dorms."

==== CityPlex Towers ====
In 1981, the [[City of Faith Medical and Research Center]] opened. The buildings are south of the ORU campus, and were originally built as a 60-story clinic, a 30-story hospital, and a 20-story research center. The original tenants left in 1989 because of [[Finance|financial]] problems and a lack of demand for medical services. As of 2007, some floors (in the 20-story building) have never been leased. The facility is now mostly leased out as [[commerce|commercial]] [[office]] space under the name [[CityPlex Towers]]. A 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18.2 m), 30 [[ton]] bronze sculpture ''Praying Hands'', by sculptor Leonard McMurray (cast in [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Mexico]] in 1980) and originally in front of the towers, was moved to the ORU campus entrance in the summer of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa World ''[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&amp;articleid=240903&amp;archive=yes Moving hands]'' retrieved 09 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Oral Roberts Golden Eagles}}
Oral Roberts University is a member of [[The Summit League]] after leaving its former conference home, [[Southland Conference]], in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There is also a baseball program for men and volleyball for women.

ORU's early sports team nicknames were the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] for men and the Lady Titans for women, adopted in 1965 by a vote of the student body. On April 30, 1993, all teams for both men and women became known as the [[Oral Roberts Golden Eagles|Golden Eagle]]s. ORU's current [[mascot]] is "Eli" the [[golden eagle]], who hatched out of his [[papier-mâché]] egg on November 17, 1993 before the start of an exhibition basketball game as the official symbol of a new era in ORU athletics. The mascot's name is an [[acronym]] for education, lifeskills and integrity.

The men's basketball team coached by [[Scott Sutton]] went to three straight [[NCAA]] tournaments from 2006 to 2008.{{When|date=March 2012}} ORU's women's basketball team has appeared in four NCAA tournaments in the past eight seasons.

The ORU baseball team has played in 21 NCAA regional tournaments. ORU advanced to the College World Series in 1978. In 2006, ORU advanced to the NCAA Super Regional against Clemson.  ORU baseball once won 12 consecutive conference championships and played in 12 consecutive NCAA regional tournaments (1998 to 2009).&lt;ref name="thesummitleague.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesummitleague.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3900&amp;ATCLID=3742285 |title=ORU Captures Baseball Championship Title With 6-2 Win Over SDSU - theSummitLeague.org—Official Web Site of The Summit League |publisher=Thesummitleague.org |date=2009-05-24 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723023808/http://www.thesummitleague.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3900&amp;ATCLID=3742285 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Doctrine ===
ORU has been criticized for endorsing [[orthodoxy|unorthodox]] doctrines of [[faith]]. Critics cite Oral Roberts' connection with [[Word of Faith]] doctrine and how they believe this has been used for self-promotion and justification of [[economic materialism]]. Oral Roberts helped pioneer the concept of "[[Seed Faith]]", which associated acts of God with the results of an individual's previous investment into God's will, like a plant growing from the investment of a seed. Scriptural citations for the doctrine include Luke 6:38  "Give, and it shall be given unto you, full measure pressed down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom; for what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you again". Critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} claim this is equivalent to believing [[miracle]]s can be bought and makes God into a manipulable party. This so-called "Seed Faith" is thought of widely  as a scam to trick socially and intellectually weak believers into sending funds to preachers who adhere to this principle.

Some of the earliest criticisms of the Word of Faith movement came from ORU faculty members including Professor [[Charles Farah]] and one of his students, Daniel Ray McConnell. McConnell submitted a PhD thesis to the university detailing his assertion that the teachings of the movement are heretical. This was later published as ''A Different Gospel'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;D.R.

In February 1997, on the 28th day of [[Ramadan]], several students from Oral Roberts University reportedly disrupted services at a mosque in the city of [[Tulsa]] near the [[University of Tulsa]]. The students mistakenly thought it was the 27th night of Ramadan, which is the holiest night of the Muslim calendar. Mujeeb Cheema, the chairman of the Islamic Society of Tulsa at that time, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "Some 20 Oral Roberts students put their hands on the exterior doors and walls of the mosque and prayed for the conversion of the Muslims." The students left after police had been summoned to the scene.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/12/us/oral-roberts-students-anger-muslims.html|title=Oral Roberts Students Anger Muslims|date=12 February 1997|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the event, the society received a written apology from the Reverend Bill Shuler, who was the director of religious services on the ORU campus. A university spokesman indicated that the students would not be disciplined and that officials from the university were discussing with the students their accounts of the events, which differed from what was reported by the Muslims attending the religious services. Another Oral Roberts official, Jesse Pisors, further stated that despite the fact that students were praying for the conversion of Muslims, "their purpose specifically was not to proselytize or to intimidate."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

=== LGBT issues ===
Citing alleged discrimination against [[LGBT]] students at ORU, in 2006 [[Soulforce (organization)|Soulforce]] placed the university on its 2006 [[Equality Ride]] route and the rally took place on March 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/422259/activists_plan_to_visit_2_private_colleges/index.html "Activists Plan to Visit 2 Private Colleges"] redOrbit, September 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; University administration refused the activists the right to enter the campus and several were arrested after they entered the campus in spite of the university administration's decision.  Soulforce members object to the university's honor code pledge's ban on homosexual activity (i.e. homosexual intercourse). All students are required to sign and abide by the honor code which places the same restriction on all sexual activity performed outside of "traditional marriage of one man and one woman."&lt;ref name="Oral Roberts University 2009"/&gt;

While homosexual activity is against the school's honor code, many LGBTQ students have still attended the school due to family or personal choice. Over time, ORU alumni have made groups such as ORU-OUT and gay-straight alliances to allow LGBTQ students and alumni to have social support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oruout.com/|title=oruout — All for One and Love for All|work=oruout|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102162423/http://www.oruout.com/|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oru-out.tumblr.com/|title=ORU Out|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215221549/http://oru-out.tumblr.com/|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alumni of the University have also dedicated Facebook groups and petitions to stand against harsh anti-gay laws in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/ORU-Alumni-Against-Ugandas-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill/168570909834655?sk=info|title=ORU Alumni Against Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Bill - About - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In botany, the phrase '''''ordo naturalis''''', "natural order", was once used for what today is a [[family (biology)|family]]. Its origins lie with [[Carl Linnaeus]] who used the word when he referred to natural groups of plants in his lesser-known work, particularly ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]''. In his more famous works the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', plants were arranged according to his artificial "Sexual system", and Linnaeus used the word "ordo" for an artificial unit. In those works, only genera and species (sometimes varieties) were "real" [[taxa]].

In nineteenth-century works such as the ''[[de Candolle system|Prodromus]]'' of de Candolle and the ''[[Bentham &amp; Hooker system|Genera Plantarum]]'' of Bentham &amp; Hooker, the word ''ordo'' did indicate taxa that are now given the rank of family. Contemporary French works used the word "famille" for these same taxa.  In the first international ''Rules'' of [[botanical nomenclature]] of 1906 the word family (''familia'') was assigned to this rank, while the term "order" (''ordo'') was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the nineteenth century had often been named a ''cohors'' (plural ''cohortes'').

The ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' provides for names published in the rank of ''ordo naturalis'' in Art 18.2: normally, these are to be accepted as family names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }} Article 18.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plant families retain the name they were given by pre-Linnaean authors, recognised by Linnaeus as "natural orders" (e.g. ''[[Palmae]]'' or ''[[Labiatae]]''). Such names are known as [[Descriptive botanical names|descriptive]] family names.

'''The Oriental Institute in Sarajevo''' ({{lang-bs|Orijentalni institut u Sarajevu / Оријентални институт у Сарајеву}}) is an academic institute in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was founded in 1950 by the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is part of the [[University of Sarajevo]]. but it suffered significant destruction in 1992 during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]].

==1992 shelling==
Its premises, research library and complete manuscript collection (more than 2,000 codices and 15,000 other archival material) were deliberately destroyed in shelling on May 18, 1992 by Serb forces around the [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged city of Sarajevo]]. According to interviews with eyewitnesses, the building had been hit with a barrage of incendiary munitions, fired from positions on the hills overlooking the town center. No other buildings in the densely built neighborhood were hit. The Institute, which occupied the top floors of a large, four-storey office block on the corner of Veljka Cubrilovica Street and Marshal Tito Boulevard ([[Centar Municipality, Sarajevo|Sarajevo Centar]] municipality), was completely burned out, its collections destroyed. 

The manuscript collection of the Oriental institute was one of the richest collections of Oriental manuscripts worldwide. These manuscripts over centuries were written in the wide areas of the East to serve worldwide as life manuals for the people. 

Losses also included 5,263 bound manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Hebrew and local ''[[arebica]]'' - ''(Bosnian in Arabic script)'', as well as tens of thousands of Ottoman-era documents.

In [[public policy]], '''outrage factor''' is public opposition to a policy that is not based on the knowledge of the technical details. The term "outrage factor" originates from Peter Sandman's 1993 book, ''Responding to Community Outrage: Strategies for Effective Risk Communication''.&lt;ref name="nebel"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Nebel|first=Bernard J.|author2=Richard T. Wright |title=Environmental science: the way the world works  |publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|year=1993 |edition=4th|pages=392–3|isbn=0-13-285446-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wjxeUeaRnMC&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA393#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hird"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Hird |first=John A. |title=Superfund: the political economy of environmental risk |publisher=JHU Press|year=1994 |page=70|isbn=0-8018-4807-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsTBXJPVmzgC&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Outrage factors" are the emotional factors that influence perception of risk. The risks that are considered involuntary, industrial and unfair are often given more weight than factors that are thought of as voluntary, natural and fair.

Sandman gives the formula:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{{quote|Risk {{=}} Hazard + Outrage}}

== Risk communications ==
While [[policy analysis]] by institutional [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholder]]s typically focuses on [[risk-benefit analysis]] and [[cost-benefit analysis]], popular [[risk perception]] is not informed by the same concerns. The successful implementation of a policy relying on public support and cooperation must address the outrage factor when informing the public about the policy.

In an interview with ''[[New York Times]]'' [[journalist]] and [[Freakonomics]] author [[Stephen J. Dubner]], Sandman emphasized "the most important truth in risk communication is the exceedingly low correlation between whether a risk is dangerous, and whether it's upsetting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/29/risk-hazard-outrage-a-conversation-with-risk-consultant-peter-sandman/

[[File:Uhuru Design Cyclone Lounger.png|thumb|A lounge chair using reclaimed wood]]
'''Reclaimed lumber''' is [[processed wood]] retrieved from its original application for purposes of subsequent use. Most reclaimed [[lumber]] comes from timbers and decking rescued from old [[barn]]s, factories and warehouses, although some companies use wood from less traditional structures such as boxcars, [[coal mine]]s and [[wine barrel]]s. Reclaimed or antique lumber is used primarily for decoration and home building, for example for siding, architectural details, cabinetry, [[furniture]] and flooring.

==Wood origins==
In the [[United States of America]], wood once functioned as the primary building material because it was strong, relatively inexpensive and abundant. Today, many of the woods that were once plentiful are only available in large quantities through reclamation. One common reclaimed wood, [[longleaf pine]], was used to build factories and warehouses during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The trees were slow-growing (taking 200 to 400 years to mature), tall, straight, and had a natural ability to resist mold and insects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridata.com/ref/p/pinu_pal.cfm Floridata: Pinus palustris&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were also abundant. [[Longleaf pine]] grew in thick forests that spanned over {{convert|140000|sqmi|km2}} of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longleafalliance.org Longleaf Pine Forests and Longleaf Alliance Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Reclaimed [[longleaf pine]] is often sold as Heart Pine, where the word "heart" refers to the [[heartwood]] of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.longleaflumber.com/reclaimed-heart-pine/ Longleaf Lumber&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously common woods for building barns and other structures were [[redwood]] (Sequoia sempervirens) on the U.S. west coast and [[American Chestnut]] on the U.S. east coast. Beginning in 1904, a [[chestnut blight]] spread across the US, killing billions of American Chestnuts, so when these structures were later dismantled, they were a welcome source of this desirable but later rare wood for subsequent reuse. American Chestnut wood can be identified as pre- or post-blight by analysis of worm tracks in sawn timber. The presence of worm tracks suggests the trees were felled as dead standing timber, and may be post-blight lumber.

Barns are one of the most common sources for reclaimed wood in the United States. Those constructed through the early 19th century were typically built using whatever trees were growing on or near the builder's property. They often contain a mix of oak, chestnut, poplar, hickory and pine timber. Beam sizes were limited to what could be moved by man and horse. The wood was often hand-hewn with an axe and/or [[adze]]. Early settlers likely recognized American oak from their experience with its European species. Red, white, black, scarlet, willow, post, and pin [[oak]] varieties have all been used in North American barns.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Mill buildings throughout the Northeast also provide an abundant source of reclaimed wood. Wood that is reclaimed from these buildings includes structural timbers - such as beams, posts, and joists - along with decking, flooring, and sheathing. These buildings often have no economic or reuse possibility, can be a fire hazard, and may require varying degrees of environmental cleanup. Reclaiming lumber and brick from these retired mills is considered a better use of materials than landfill-based disposal.

Another source of reclaimed wood is old [[snowfence]]. At the end of their tenure on the mountains and plains of the [[Rocky Mountain]] region, snowfence boards are a valued source of consistent, structurally sound and reliable reclaimed wood.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.centennialwoods.com/blog/reclaimed-lumber.html Centennial Woods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other woods recycled and reprocessed into new wood products include [[coast redwood]], [[hard maple]], [[Douglas Fir]], walnuts, hickories, red and [[white oak|White Oak]], and [[Eastern white pine]].

==Properties==
Reclaimed lumber is popular for many reasons: the wood's unique appearance, its contribution to [[green building]], the history of the wood's origins, and the wood's physical characteristics such as strength, stability and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.terramai.com/pages.aspx?id=234|title=Why Reclaimed Wood?|website=www.terramai.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased strength of reclaimed wood is often attributed to the wood often having been harvested from virgin growth timber, which generally grew more slowly, producing a denser grain. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Reclaimed beams can often be sawn into wider planks than newly harvested lumber, and many companies claim their products are more stable than newly-cut wood because reclaimed wood has been exposed to changes in humidity for far longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://superior-hardwoods.com/top-10-reasons-to-choose-reclaimed-wood/|title=Top 10 Reasons to Choose Reclaimed Wood|website=www.superior-hardwoods.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclaimed lumber industry==
The reclaimed lumber industry gained momentum in the early 1980s on the West Coast when large-scale reuse of softwoods began. The industry grew due to a growing concern for environmental impact as well as declining quality in new lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p2pays.org/ref/12/11761.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  On the East Coast, industry pioneers began selling reclaimed wood in the early 1970s but the industry stayed mostly small until the 1990s as waste disposal increased and deconstruction became a more economically alternative to demolition. A trade association, the [[Reclaimed Wood Council]], was formed in May 2003 but dissolved in January 2008 due to a lack of participation among the larger reclaimed wood distributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0VCW/is_16_25/ai_55781815 Recycled lumber enjoys rebirth | Home Channel News | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaimed lumber is sold under a number of names, such as antique lumber, distressed lumber, recovered lumber, upcycled lumber, and others. It is often confused with [[salvage logging]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longleaflumber.com/reclaimed-wood-names-what-do-they-mean/ Reclaimed Wood Names: What do they mean?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==LEED==
The [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System is the US Green Building Council's (USGBC) benchmark for designing, building and operating green buildings. To be certified, projects must first meet the prerequisites designated by the USGBC and then earn a certain number of credits within six categories: sustainable sites, [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and design process. 

Using reclaimed wood can earn credits towards achieving LEED project certification. Because reclaimed wood is considered recycled content, it meets the 'materials and resources' criteria for LEED certification, and because some reclaimed lumber products are [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) certified, they can qualify for LEED credits under the 'certified wood' category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19 Usgbc: Leed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
With reclaimed material being so popular, it is becoming more difficult to source. With such a high demand, some sellers try to pass newer wood off as antique. 

It is also common (although not necessarily done intentionally) for species to be misidentified because it is difficult to tell the difference in older material unless it is cut open and examined, leaving the material less desirable. Professionals in the field and with established reclaimed wood enterprises do not have difficulty identifying the species.

Reclaimed lumber sometimes has pieces of metal embedded in it, such as broken off nails, so milling the material can often ruin planer knives, saw blades, and moulder knives. Nail-compatible saw blades are advisable for the same reason, as well as for safety.  The alternative is to remove all metal from the reclaimed lumber, which is a costly and tedious process commonly achieved by scanning each piece of wood with a metal detector and then manually pulling out all nails, bolts, bullets, screws, buckshot, and other miscellaneous metal hardware. This process can make the cost of reclaimed lumber higher than new lumber.

Many sources of reclaimed wood cannot verify what the wood might have been treated with over its lifetime. This uncertainty leads to fears of harmful offgassing of [[volatile organic compounds]] associated with lead paint or various stains and treatments that may have been used on the wood. These fears are particularly pressing when the wood is for an interior application.

'''The Recurse Center''' (formerly known as '''Hacker School'''; also called '''RC''') is an independent educational institution, combining a retreat for computer programmers with a [[Recruitment|recruiting]] agency. The retreat is an [[intentional community]], a self-directed academic environment for programmers of all levels to improve their skills in, without charge. There is no curriculum and no particular programming languages or paradigms are institutionally favored; instead, participants work on [[Open-source software|open-source projects]] of their own choice, alone or collaboratively, as they see best. The Center has been an active advocate for [[Women in computing|women in programming]].

== History ==

The Center was initially founded in the Summer of 2010 as '''Hackruiter''', an engineering [[recruitment|recruiting]] company, using seed money from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]. The idea quickly arose of trying to transform recruiting for start-ups by running a retreat as part of the process, with the goal of helping clients become better programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It officially opened its doors as “Hacker School” in New York in July, 2011, obliquely anticipating the [[Coding Bootcamp|coding bootcamp]] movement that arose in the mid-2010s. Hacker School came to wide public attention in mid-2012, when it partnered with the e-commerce company [[Etsy]] to offer “Hacker Grants” in support of female developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A number of companies soon joined Etsy in funding these grants, and in 2014 the grant program expanded to offer support to other groups not well represented in American technology industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2015 Hacker School was renamed the Recurse Center.

== Business model ==

The programming retreat is free of charge for admitted applicants to attend. The organization itself is for-profit and supports itself through recruitment, by placing some participants in programming jobs.&lt;ref name='jobs'&gt;{{cite web
	|url= https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-recruiting
	|title= Jobs, recruiting, and how we make money 
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
	|work= Manual
	|accessdate= November 26, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the retreat reached the "tipping point" of self-sufficiency purely from recruiting income.&lt;ref name='blog-83'&gt;{{cite web

	|accessdate= November 26, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal costs to the company have been reported at "nearly $12,000" for each participant.&lt;ref name='jobs' /&gt;

The Center does not publish statistics on its admission rate, although there is no published rule against reapplication.

== Educational philosophy and name ==

There is no curriculum; each participant imposes their own structure for self-directed learning on their stay at the Recurse Center, with guidance as requested. Despite its original name ”Hacker School“, the Recurse Center is not a school — its model of self-directed learning was inspired by the [[Unschooling]] philosophy of [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] (1923–1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nor does it have any connection to the popular notion of a hacker as someone who breaks into computer systems — rather, “hacker” here was intended to suggest a programmer who is technically resourceful but also supportive of other programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	|publisher= Recurse Center  
	|accessdate= May 1, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the organization changed its name to the Recurse Center to avoid confusion over these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the faculty have experimented continually with day-to-day experience in the retreat. Experiments have included:

== Social environment and influence ==

The Center did not initially publish a code of conduct, but eventually formalized its expectations of participant behavior in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  
	|url= https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct
	|title= Code of Conduct
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
        |date= June 9, 2017
	|accessdate= June 9, 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, to promote a study environment in which people feel comfortable asking each other for guidance and criticism, the Center has long used a set of “lightweight social rules” to guide interactions between participants. In contrast to traditional “[[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]]”, many of which have a legalistic tone, the social rules are intended to shepherd community behavior unobtrusively, “to remove as many distractions as possible so everyone can focus on programming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	|title= Social rules
	|work= Manual
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
	|accessdate= November 25, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social rules are one of the retreat's most influential features and have been adopted by a number of other programming communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Specializations of participants ==

The level of participants' skill and experience is diverse, in common with retreats in other creative fields and unlike many engineering organizations. Participants range from long-experienced software developers on [[Career break|sabbatical]], to people who have been coding for only a few months, to retirees, to college students on vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants hold doctoral degrees; others have left school before completing secondary or even primary education. Many participants are engineers, but others have strong non-engineering backgrounds, in the Humanities, journalism, pure mathematics, the performing arts, among many others.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The '''Saltire Prize''', named after the [[flag of Scotland]], is the national award for advances in the commercial development of [[marine energy]].

To be considered for the £10 million award teams must demonstrate, in [[Scottish waters]], a commercially viable [[Wave energy|wave]] or [[tidal stream energy]] technology "that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea."

The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/challenge |title=The Challenge | publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already there are five competitors registered.

==Additional prizes==

• The '''Saltire Prize Lecture''' - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring.  The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government.

• The '''Saltire Prize Medal''' - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner.

• The '''Junior Saltire Prize''' - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential.  It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6.

• A '''Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate''' in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012.  The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment.

• '''Power of the Sea''' - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy.	In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners.

==History==
When it was first announced in 2008 it was the world's largest ever single prize for innovation in marine renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/04/02151533 |title=World to compete for Saltire Prize| publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is overseen by the Challenge Committee. Saltire Prize policy is the responsibility of the Offshore Renewables Policy Team in the Scottish Government's Energy and Climate Change Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/about-us |title=About us| publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==

The Academy has eight Departments, one Institute of Musicology and one Center of Music Education:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AALMOZNINO4.JPG|thumb|right|[[Albert Almoznino]]'s shadow art]] --&gt;
{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18514">In music, the term '''''swing''''' has two main uses. Colloquially, it is used to describe the sense of propulsive [[rhythm]]ic "feel" or "[[Groove (music)|groove]]" created by the musical interaction between the performers, especially when the music creates a "visceral response" such as feet-tapping or head-nodding (see [[pulse (music)|pulse]]). The term is also used more specifically, to refer to a technique (most commonly associated with jazz but also used in other genres) that involves alternately lengthening and shortening the pulse-divisions in a rhythm.

== Swing as a "feel" ==
Like the term "[[set (music)|groove]]", which is used to describe a cohesive rhythmic "feel" in a funk or rock context, the concept of "swing" can be hard to define. Indeed, some dictionaries use the terms as synonyms: "Groovy ... denotes music that really swings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfo.net/usa/slang.html|title=Swing Slang|website=Big Bands Database Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Jazz in America'' glossary defines it as "when an individual player or ensemble performs in such a rhythmically coordinated way as to command a visceral response from the listener (to cause feet to tap and heads to nod); an irresistible gravitational buoyancy that defies mere verbal definition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzinamerica.org/JazzResources/Glossary/q/zz|title=Jazz Resources: Glossary|website=Jazz in America|publisher=The Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swing has been called "the most debated word in jazz". When jazz performer [[Cootie Williams]] was asked to define it, he joked, "Define it? I'd rather tackle [[theory of relativity|Einstein's theory]]!"&lt;ref name="Savoy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savoyballroom.com/nets/context1/whatis1.htm|title=What Is Swing?|website=Savoy Ballroom}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Louis Armstrong]] was asked on the [[Bing Crosby]] radio show what swing was, he said, "Ah, swing, well, we used to call it syncopation—then they called it ragtime, then blues—then jazz. Now, it's swing. Ha! Ha! White folks, yo'all sho is a mess."&lt;ref name="Argyle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Argyle|first1=Ray|title=Scott Joplin and the Age of Ragtime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STq94Q-pzwoC&amp;pg=PA172|website=Google Books|publisher=McFarland|language=en|date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Benny Goodman]], the 1930s-era bandleader nicknamed the "King of Swing", called swing "free speech in music", whose most important element is "the liberty a [[solo (music)|soloist]] has to stand and play a [[refrain|chorus]] in the way he feels it". His contemporary [[Tommy Dorsey]] gave a more ambiguous definition when he proposed that "Swing is sweet and hot at the same time and broad enough in its creative conception to meet every challenge tomorrow may present."&lt;ref name="Savoy"/&gt; [[Boogie-woogie]] pianist [[Maurice Rocco]] argues that the definition of swing "is just a matter of personal opinion".&lt;ref name="Savoy"/&gt;  When asked for a definition of swing, [[Fats Waller]] replied, "Lady, if you gotta ask, you'll never know."&lt;ref name= Dance&gt;Dance, Stanley, 1974, The World of Swing: An Oral History of Big Band Jazz (2001 edition) Da Capo Press, 436 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treadwell stated:
{{quote|What is Swing? Perhaps the best answer, after all, was supplied by the hep-cat who rolled her eyes, stared into the far-off and sighed, "You can feel it, but you just can't explain it. Do you dig me?"|Treadwell (1946), p.10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treadwell|first=Bill|date=1946|chapter=Introduction: What Is Swing|title=Big Book of Swing|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stanley Dance, in ''The World of Swing'', devoted the two first chapters of his work to discussions of the concept of swing with a collection of the musicians who played it.  They described a kinetic quality to the music.  It was compared to flying; "take off" was a signal to start a solo.  The rhythmic pulse continued between the beats, expressed in dynamics, articulation, and inflection. Swing was as much in the music anticipating the beat, like the swing of a jumprope anticipating the jump, as in the beat itself.&lt;ref name="Dance"/&gt;  Swing has been defined in terms of formal rhythmic devices, but according to the [[Jimmie Lunceford]] tune, "T'aint whatcha do, it's the way thatcha do it" (say it so it swings).

==Swing as a rhythmic style==

In swing rhythm, the pulse is divided unequally, such that certain subdivisions (typically either eighth note or sixteenth note subdivisions) alternate between long and short durations. Certain music of the Baroque and Classical era is played using ''[[notes inégales]]'', which is analogous to swing. In shuffle rhythm, the first note in a pair may be twice (or more) the duration of the second note. In swing rhythm, the ratio of the first note's duration to the second note's duration can take on a range of magnitudes. In traditional jazz, swing is typically applied to eighth notes. In other genres, such as funk and jazz-rock, swing is often applied to sixteenth notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frane|first=Andrew V.|year=2017|title=Swing rhythm in classic drum breaks from hip-hop's breakbeat canon|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=34|issue=3|pages=291–302|DOI=10.1525/mp.2017.34.3.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pressing|first=Jeff|date=2002|title=Black Atlantic Rhythm.

[[File:Shuffle feel simple.png|thumb|center|400px|Basic shuffle rhythm {{Audio|Shuffle feel simple.mid|play}}]]

In most [[jazz]] music, especially of the [[big band]] era and later, the second and fourth beats of a 4/4 measure are emphasized over the first and third, and the beats are lead-in—main-beat couplets (dah-DUM, dah-DUM....).  The "dah" anticipates, or leads into, the "DUM."  The "dah" lead-in may or may not be audible.  It may be occasionally accented for phrasing or dynamic purposes.  The first note of each pair is often understood to be twice as long as the second, implying a [[tuplet|triplet]] feel, but in practice the ratio is less definitive and is often much more subtle.&lt;ref name="Jazz Drummers' Swing Ratio in Relation to Tempo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazz Drummers' Swing Ratio in Relation to Tempo |publisher=Acoustical Society of America |accessdate=2008-07-22 |url=http://www.acoustics.org/press/137th/friberg.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518055139/http://www.acoustics.org/press/137th/friberg.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The instruments of a swing rhythm section express swing in different ways from each other, and the devices evolved as the music developed.  During the early development of [[swing music]], the bass was often played with lead-in—main-note couplets, often with a percussive sound.  Later, the lead-in note was dropped but incorporated into the physical rhythm of the bass player to help keep the beat "solid."  Similarly, the rhythm guitar was played with the lead-in beat in the player's physical rhythm but inaudible.  The piano was played with a variety of devices for swing.  Chord patterns played in the rhythm of a dotted-eight—sixteenth couplet were characteristic of boogie-woogie playing (sometimes also used in boogie-woogie horn section playing).  The "swing bass" left hand, used by [[James P. Johnson]], [[Fats Waller]], and [[Earl Hines]], used a bass note on the first and third beats, followed by a mid-range chord to emphasize the second and fourth beats.  The lead-in beats were not audible, but expressed in the motion of the left arm.  Swing bass piano also put the first and third beats a role anticipatory to the emphasized second and fourth beats in two-beat figures.&lt;ref name="Hadlock"&gt;Hadlock, Richard, Jazz Masters of the Twenties, New York, MacMillan, 1972, 255p.&lt;/ref&gt;   As swing music developed, the role of the piano in the ensemble changed to emphasize accents and fills; these were often played on the lead-in to the main beat, adding a punch to the rhythm.  [[Count Basie]]'s style was sparse, played as accompaniment to the horn sections and soloists.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Ross, Jazz Style in Kansas City and the Southwest, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, 1972, 291 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bass and snare drums started the swing era as the main timekeepers, with the snare usually used for either lead-ins or emphasis on the second and fourth beats.  It was soon found that the high-hat cymbal could add a new dimension to the swing expressed by the drum kit when played in a two-beat "ti-tshhh-SH" figure, with the "ti" the lead-in to the "tshhh" on the first and third beats, and the "SH"  the emphasized second and fourth beats.  With that high-hat figure, the drummer expressed three elements of swing: the lead-in with the "ti," the continuity of the rhythmic pulse between the beats with the "tshhh," and the emphasis on the second and fourth beats with the "SH".  Early examples of that high-hat figure were recorded by the drummer [[Chick Webb]].  [[Jo Jones]] carried the high-hat style a step further, with a more continuous-sounding "t'shahhh-uhh" two beat figure while reserving the bass and snare drum for accents.  The changed role of the drum kit away from the heavier style of the earlier drumming placed more emphasis on the role of the bass in holding the rhythm.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

Horn sections and soloists added inflection and dynamics to the rhythmic toolbox, "swinging" notes and phrases.  One of the characteristic horn section sounds of swing jazz was a section chord played with a strong attack, a slight fade, and a quick accent at the end, expressing the rhythmic pulse between beats.  That device was used interchangeably or in combination with a slight downward slur between the beginning and the end of the note.  Similarly, section arrangements sometimes used a series of triplets, either accented on the first and third notes or with every other note accented to make a 3/2 pattern.  Straight eighth notes were commonly used in solos, with dynamics and articulation used to express phrasing and swing.  Phrasing dynamics built swing across two or four measures or, in the innovative style of tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]], across odd sequences of measures, sometimes starting or stopping without regard to place in the measure.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

The rhythmic devices of the swing era became subtler with bebop. [[Bud Powell]] and other piano players influenced by him mostly did away with left-hand rhythmic figures, replacing them with chords.  The ride cymbal played in a "ting-ti-ting" pattern took the role of the high-hat, the snare drum was mainly used for lead-in accents, and the bass drum was mainly used for occasional "bombs."  But the importance of the lead-in as a rhythmic device was still respected.  Drummer [[Max Roach]] emphasized the importance of the lead-in, audible or not, in "protecting the beat."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Miles, and Troupe, Quincy, Miles: The Autobiography, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1989, 448 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bebop soloists rose to the challenge of keeping a swinging feel in highly sophisticated music often played at a breakneck pace.  The groundbreakers of bebop had come of age as musicians with swing and, while breaking the barriers of the swing era, still reflected their swing heritage.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

[[File:Dotted eighth-sixteenth.png|thumb|right|Hard swing (3:1): dotted eighth + sixteenth.]]
*Various rhythmic swing approximations:
**≈1:1 = eighth note + eighth note, "straight eighths" (accent the "and"). {{Audio|Shuffle feel straight.mid|play rhythm from introduction with no shuffle, as straight eighths}}
**≈3:2 = long eighth + short eighth, "swing" or "shuffle" {{Audio|Shuffle feel in between.mid|play example with light swing}}
**≈2:1 = triplet quarter note + triplet eighth, triple [[meter (music)|meter]]; "medium swing" or "medium shuffle" {{Audio|Shuffle feel.mid|play example}}
**≈3:1 = dotted eighth note + sixteenth note; "hard swing" or "hard shuffle" {{Audio|Shuffle feel dotted eighth.mid|play example with hard swing}}

| [[File:Shuffle feel-hard-swing.theora.ogv|thumb|none|3:1 ratio – hard swing]]
|}

The subtler end of the range involves treating written pairs of adjacent eighth notes (or sixteenth notes, depending on the level of swing) as slightly asymmetrical pairs of similar values. On the other end of the spectrum, the "[[dotted note|dotted eighth]] – sixteenth" rhythm, consists of a long note three times as long as the short. Prevalent "dotted rhythms" such as these in the [[rhythm section]] of dance bands in the mid-20th century are more accurately described as a "shuffle";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prögler|first=J. A.|date=1995|title=Searching for Swing: Participatory Discrepancies in the Jazz Rhythm Section|journal=Ethnomusicology|volume=39|issue=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are also an important feature of [[baroque dance]] and many other styles. Rhythms identified as swung notes most commonly fall somewhere between straight eighths and a quarter-eighth triplet pattern.

In jazz, the swing ratio typically lies somewhere between 1:1 and 3:1, and can vary considerably. Swing ratios in jazz tend to be wider at slower tempos and narrower at faster tempos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friberg|first=Anders|last2=Sundström|first2=Andreas|year=2002|title=Swing Ratios and Ensemble Timing in Jazz Performance: Evidence for a Common Rhythmic Pattern|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=19|issue=3|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[jazz]] scores, swing is often assumed, but is sometimes explicitly indicated. For example, "[[Satin Doll]]", a [[swing era]] jazz standard, was notated in {{music|time|4|4}} time and in some versions includes the direction, ''medium swing''.

===Genres using swing rhythm===

Swing is commonly used in [[blues]], [[country music|country]], and [[jazz]], and often appears in other genres such as rock, funk, and hip-hop. Much written music in jazz is assumed to be performed with a swing rhythm. Styles that always use traditional (triplet) rhythms, resembling "hard swing", include [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], [[quickstep]] and some other [[ballroom dances]], [[Stride piano]], and 1920s-era [[Novelty piano]] (the successor to Ragtime style).

'''''United States v. Morgan''''', 346 U.S. 502 (1954), is a landmark decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which provides the writ of [[coram nobis]] as the proper application to request federal post-conviction judicial review for those who have completed the conviction's incarceration.

==Background==
The ancient writ of [[coram nobis]] originated in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after the conclusion of a case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error.  The writ of coram nobis was identical to the [[Habeas corpus in the United States|writ of habeas corpus]]; except, the writ of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the writ of coram nobis was available to everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] provided courts in the United States the authority to issue [[writ|writs]] to achieve justice as long as the writ does not conflict with constitutional rights or legislative statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], 1 Stat. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 1911, the authorization of the federal judiciary to issue writs was modified into 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a) and is known as the [[All Writs Act|“all-writs section of the Judicial Code”]].) In 1946, the writ of coram nobis was considered obsolete when Congress added Rule 60(e) to the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] which specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 60|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this time, federal courts only used the writ of coram nobis to correct errors in federal civil cases because errors in federal criminal cases could be corrected with a writ of habeas corpus.  Thus, in its 1947 decision, ''United States v. Smith'', the Supreme Court observed “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898|title=''United States v. Smith'', 331 US 469, 475 n.4 (1947)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about whether the writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appropriate resurfaced just one year later with the Act of June 25, 1948 which codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and provided only those individuals in-custody access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the Act of June 25, 1948, the writ of habeas corpus was the sole application for United States federal courts to review convictions of those who had completed their incarceration.  Following the Act of June 25, 1948, federal courts were left to decide whether the act eliminated any review of convictions for those who had completed their incarceration or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration.

''Morgan'' resolved these questions by determining that those who had completed their incarceration could challenge their conviction through the writ of coram nobis.  Although the Supreme Court states in ''Carlisle v. United States'', “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate [for prisoners and others serving out a term of a federal conviction],”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985|title=''Carlisle v. United States'', 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morgan'' provides when the writ of coram nobis is necessary or appropriate for those who are no longer in-custody.

==Case==
In 1939, nineteen-year-old Robert Patrick Morgan pled guilty to stealing three letters from the US Post Office and was sentenced in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] to four years in federal prison; however, Morgan’s [[constitutional right|constitutional rights]] were violated because he was not provided an attorney nor did he waive his constitutional right to an attorney. Unfortunately for Morgan, he was unaware that his constitutional rights were violated until after he had completed his sentence. In 1950, Morgan was convicted of attempted burglary in a New York county court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his 1939 federal conviction, the county court applied New York’s Multiple Offenders Law and sentenced Morgan to seven to ten years at [[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica Prison]].

In 1952, Morgan first became aware of the constitutional violations related to his 1939 federal conviction. As a result, he petitioned the district court for the writ of coram nobis. If successful, his state sentence would be reduced because he would no longer be considered a multiple offender. The district court denied Morgan’s petition on the ground that the coram nobis petition was to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which was unavailable to Morgan because he was no longer in federal custody. Morgan appealed the district court’s decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The case was argued before the appellate court on January 13, 1953. On February 5, 1953, the three-judge panel unanimously determined that Morgan was entitled to the writ of coram nobis and reversed the district court’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11147499741758364560|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 202 F.2d 67, 69 (1953)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appellate court’s decision, the attorney’s office for the United States petitioned and was granted a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Morgan'', 345 U. S. 974 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]''United States v. Morgan'' was argued on October 19, 1953 and decided January 4, 1954. In a 5-4 decision, the Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that federal courts have the authority under the all-writs section of the Judicial Code to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) syllabus|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Forman Reed|Justice Stanley Reed]] wrote for the majority in ''Morgan'', which held:
* Federal District Courts, under the authority of the All-Writs Section, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), may issue the writ of coram nobis. ''id.'' at 506-510.
* A motion for a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and “is of the same general character as a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” ''id.'' at 505, n.4.
* A writ of coram nobis should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice. ''id.'' at 511.
* If no other remedy is available and sound reasons existing for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, a motion of the writ of coram nobis must be heard by the federal court. ''id.'' at 512.
* Since adverse consequences resulting from the conviction persist after conclusion of a sentence, the petitioner is entitled to show that his conviction was invalid.  ''id.'' at 512-513.
* The writ of coram nobis may be issued to correct a constitutional violation. ''id.'' at 512-513.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954)|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Morgan'' broadened the writ of coram nobis, which had historically been issued only to correct [[question of fact|errors of fact]], to allow courts to also correct [[question of law|errors of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18257773315166643768|title=''Hirabayashi v.

==Division of circuit courts==
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the United States Courts of Appeals]] Federal appellate courts are currently divided on the deadline to file an appeal of a district court’s decision of a case to petition for a writ of coram nobis. Most appellate courts provide 60 days to file an appeal; two other courts provide only 10 days to file an appeal. The source of this controversy is found in footnote 4 of the ''Morgan'' decision in which the Court held the writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and also “of the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html#F4|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) footnote 4|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals because it a "step in a criminal case." Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916|title=''United States v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29360">'''Uranium in the environment''' refers to the science of the sources, environmental behaviour, and effects of [[uranium]] on humans and other animals. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive]] and remains so because of its long [[half-life|physical half-life]] (4.468 billion years for [[uranium-238]]).  The [[biological half-life]] (the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days.&lt;ref name="hyperphysics"&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/biohalf.html#c2  |title= Biological Half Lives  |author= Georgia State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04&gt;{{cite journal

==Natural occurrence==
[[File:UraniumUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Uranium ore]]
[[Uranium]] is a naturally occurring element found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. This is the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth. According to the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] the normal concentration of uranium in soil is 300&amp;nbsp;μg/kg to 11.7&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/1993.html |author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |title=Sources and effects of ionizing radiation : UNSCEAR 1993 Report to the General Assembly, with Scientific Annexes | publisher = [[United Nations]] | isbn = 92-1-142200-0 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered to be more plentiful than [[antimony]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[gold]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]], or [[tungsten]] and is about as abundant as [[tin]], [[arsenic]] or [[molybdenum]]. It is found in many minerals including [[uraninite]] (most common uranium ore), [[autunite]], [[uranophane]], [[torbernite]], and [[coffinite]]. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as [[phosphate]] rock deposits, and minerals such as [[lignite]], and [[monazite]] sands in uranium-rich [[ore]]s (it is recovered commercially from these sources).

[[Seawater]] contains about 3.3 [[parts per billion]] of uranium by weight, approximately (3.3&amp;nbsp;µg/kg) or, 3.3&amp;nbsp;micrograms per [[liter]] of seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeEUcIRsIwAC&amp;pg=PA598&amp;lpg=PA598&amp;dq=Radium+and+thorium+isotopes+in+the+surface+waters+of+the+East+Pacific+and+coastal+southern+California.+Earth+Planet.+Sci.+Lett.,+39:+235249.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0aDXxdrln8&amp;sig=T7Ne1hE0kHZ44OiV-8tr229yQQw&amp;hl=ga&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KQGVOaqB4ue7Aby8IDACQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20thorium&amp;f=false |title=Isotopes of the Earth's Hydrosphere  By V.I. Ferronsky, V.A. Polyakov, pg 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; as uranium(VI) forms soluble [[carbonate]] complexes. The extraction of uranium from seawater has been considered as a means of obtaining the element.

==Sources of uranium==

===Mining and milling===
The radiation hazards of uranium mining and milling were not appreciated in the early years, resulting in workers exposed to high levels of radiation. Conventional uranium ore treatment mills create radioactive waste in the form of [[tailings]], which contain uranium, radium, and polonium. Consequently, uranium mining results in "the unavoidable radioactive contamination of the environment by solid, liquid and gaseous wastes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Inhalation of [[radon]] gas caused sharp increases in lung cancers among underground uranium miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="ama-assn629"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, uranium mill tailings were released with impunity into water sources, and the radium leached from these tailings contaminated thousands of miles of the Colorado River system. Between 1966 and 1971, thousands of homes and commercial buildings in the Colorado Plateau region were "found to contain anomalously high concentrations of radon, after being built on uranium tailings taken from piles under the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal===
{{See also|Depleted uranium}}
[[File:30mm DU slug.jpg|thumb|right|DU penetrator from the PGU-14/B incendiary 30&amp;nbsp;mm round]]

Depleted uranium (DU) is useful because of its very high [[density]] of 19.1&amp;nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (68.4% denser than lead). Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical [[radiation therapy]] and industrial [[radiography]] equipment, and containers used to transport radioactive materials. Military uses include defensive armor plating and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectiles]].

Uranium metal can disperse into the air and water, [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]] study says in part:
: "The most important concern is the potential for future [[radioactive contamination|groundwater contamination]] by corroding penetrators (ammunition tips made out of DU). The munition tips recovered by the UNEP team had already decreased in mass by 10-15% in this way. This [[Corrosion|rapid corrosion]] speed underlines the importance of monitoring the water quality at the DU sites on an annual basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=241&amp;ArticleID=3036 |title=UNEP confirms low-level DU contamination |date=March 22, 2002 |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion===
Studies of depleted uranium aerosol exposure suggest that uranium combustion product particles would quickly settle out of the air,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deploymentlink.osd.mil/du_library/du_ii/du_ii_tabl1.htm |title=Depleted uranium |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614010814/http://www.deploymentlink.osd.mil/du_library/du_ii/du_ii_tabl1.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometres from target areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004032-200304000-00014 |author=C. Mitsakou, K. Eleftheriadis, C. Housiadas &amp; M. Lazaridis |title=Modeling of the dispersion of depleted uranium aerosol |journal=[[Health Physics (journal)|Health Physics]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=538–544 |date=April 2003 |url=http://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2003/04000/Modeling_of_the_Dispersion_of_Depleted_Uranium.14.aspx |pmid=12705453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. has admitted that there have been over 100 "friendly fire" incidents in which members of the U.S. military have been struck by DU munitions, and that an unknown number have been exposed to DU via inhalation of combustion products from burning DU munitions.

===Corrosion===
It has been reported that the corrosion of uranium in a silica rich aqueous solution forms both [[uranium dioxide]] and [[uranium trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=Goldschmidt Conference |date=7–12 September 2003 |location=[[Kurashiki]], [[Japan]] |url=http://goldschmidt.info/2003/Abstracts.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] abstract |author=E. R. Trueman, S. Black, D. Read &amp; M. E. Hodson |title=Alteration of depleted uranium metal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pure water, [[schoepite]] {(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.12(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)} is formed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Schoepite.shtml |title=Schoepite Mineral Data |publisher= |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}} in the first week and then after four months [[studtite]] {(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)} was formed.

Uranium [[metal]] reacts with [[water]] to form [[hydrogen]] gas, this reaction forms [[uranium dioxide]] and 2% to 9% [[uranium hydride]]. It is important to note that the rate of corrosion due to water is far greater than that caused by oxygen at temperatures around {{convert|100|C|F}}. At pH values below 2 the corrosion rate at 100&amp;nbsp;°C goes down greatly, while as pH values go from 7 upwards the corrosion rate declines. Gamma irradiation has little effect on the corrosion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. McD Baker, L. N. Less &amp; S. Orman |title=Uranium + water reaction. Part 1.—Kinetics, products and mechanism |journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society |volume=62 |pages=2513–2524 |year=1966 |doi=10.1039/TF9666202513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen gas inhibits the corrosion of uranium by water.

===Nuclear waste===
Spent [[uranium dioxide]] fuel is very insoluble in water, it is likely to release uranium (and [[fission products]]) even more slowly than borosilicate glass when in contact with water.&lt;ref&gt;B.E. Burakov, M.I Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation, Imperial College Press, London, 198 pp. (2010).
{{cite web |url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093650/http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while the vast majority of the uranium is removed by [[PUREX]] [[nuclear reprocessing]], a small amount of uranium is left in the [[raffinate]] from the first cycle of the PUREX process. In addition because of the decay of the transplutonium [[minor actinides]] and the residual [[plutonium]] in the waste the concentration of uranium will increase on the waste. This will occur on a time scale of hundreds and thousands of years.

==Health effects==
[[File:Trionuraniumanti.png|thumb|right|Tiron is a [[phenol]]oic [[aromatic]] [[sulfonic acid|disulfonic acid]]. It is an alternative to bicarbonate which has already been tested in animals.]]

Soluble uranium salts are [[toxic]], though less so than those of other heavy metals such as [[lead]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The organ which is most affected is the [[kidney]]. Soluble uranium salts are readily excreted in the [[urine]], although some accumulation in the kidneys does occur in the case of chronic exposure. The [[World Health Organization]] has established a daily "tolerated intake" of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5&amp;nbsp;μg/kg body weight (or 35&amp;nbsp;μg for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult): exposure at this level is not thought to lead to any significant kidney damage.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |title=Focus: Depleted Uranium |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318003818/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}}

The [[antidote]] for uranium in humans is [[bicarbonate]], which is used because uranium (VI) forms complexes with [[carbonate]]. An alternative is to use tiron (sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O. Braun, C. Contino, M.-H. Hengé-Napoli, E. Ansoborlo and B. Pucci |year=1999 |title=Development of an in vitro test for screening of chelators of uranium |journal=[[Analusis]] |volume=27 |pages=65–68 |doi=10.1051/analusis:1999108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humans===

====Cancer====
In 1950, the US Public Health service began a comprehensive study of uranium miners, leading to the first publication of a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining, released in 1962.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen. "Uranium Mine Workers, Atomic Downwinders, and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act." In Half Lives &amp; Half-Truths: Confronting the Radioactive Legacies of the Cold War, 117-143. Santa Fe: School For Advanced Research, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government eventually regulated the standard amount of [[radon]] in mines, setting the level at 0.3 [[Health effects of radon#Concentration units|WL]] on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Brugge, Doug, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis. The Navajo People and Uranium Mining. Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 69 69 present and former uranium milling sites in 12 states, 24 have been abandoned, and are the responsibility of the [[US Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomictraveler.com/MillDecommissioningData.pdf Decommissioning of U.S. Uranium Production Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accidental releases from uranium mills include the 1979 [[Church Rock uranium mill spill]] in New Mexico, called the largest accident of nuclear-related waste in US history, and the 1986 [[Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Brugge2&gt;Doug Brugge, et al, "The Sequoyah  Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill", ''American Journal of Public Health'', September 2007, Vol., 97, No. 9, pp. 1595-1600.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), granting [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] for those affected by mining, with [[amendments]] passed in 2000 to address criticisms with the original act.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

====Depleted uranium exposure====

The use of depleted uranium (DU) in [[munitions]] is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain /&gt;&lt;ref name="John E 2009"/&gt; Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04 /&gt; The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites leading to possible inhalation by human beings.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Mitsakou C, Eleftheriadis K, Housiadas C, Lazaridis M [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12705453 Modeling of the dispersion of depleted uranium aerosol.] 2003 Apr, Retrieved January 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During a three-week period of conflict in 2003 in [[Iraq]], 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of DU munitions were used.&lt;ref name="gaurdian2003"&gt;Paul Brown, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/25/internationaleducationnews.armstrade Gulf troops face tests for cancer] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 April 2003, Retrieved February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual acute and chronic toxicity of DU is also a point of medical controversy.

====Birth defects====
Most scientific studies have found no link between uranium and birth defects, but some claim statistical correlations between soldiers exposed to DU, and those who were not, concerning reproductive abnormalities.

In a study of UK troops, "Overall, the risk of any malformation among pregnancies reported by men was 50% higher in Gulf War Veterans (GWV) compared with Non-GWVs". The conclusion of the study stated ''"We found no evidence for a link between paternal deployment to the Gulf war and increased risk of stillbirth, chromosomal malformations, or congenital syndromes. Associations were found between fathers' service in the Gulf war and increased risk of miscarriage and less well-defined malformations, but these findings need to be interpreted with caution as such outcomes are susceptible to recall bias. The finding of a possible relationship with renal anomalies requires further investigation. There was no evidence of an association between risk of miscarriage and mothers' service in the gulf."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pat Doyle, Noreen Maconochie, Graham Davies, Ian Maconochie, Margo Pelerin, Susan Prior &amp; Samantha Lewis |title=Miscarriage, stillbirth and congenital malformation in the offspring of UK veterans of the first Gulf war |journal=[[International Journal of Epidemiology]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=74–86 |date=February 2004 |pmid=15075150 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyh049 |url=http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/33/1/74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior in soil===
It has been suggested that it is possible to form a ''reactive barrier'' by adding something to the soil which will cause the uranium to become fixed. One method of doing this is to use a mineral ([[apatite]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/research/highlights_archive/u_ha_prb.html |author=Christopher C. Fuller, John R. Bargar &amp; James A Davis |title=Remediation of uranium-contaminated waterat Fry Canyon, Utah |date=November 20, 2003 |publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a second method is to add a food substance such as [[acetate]] to the soil. This will enable bacteria to reduce the uranium (VI) to uranium (IV) which is much less soluble. In [[peat]]-like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the [[humic acids]], this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/publications/2000annualreview/pdfs/NHMFL2000AR-Geochemistry.pdf |title=Geochemistry |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212095102/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/publications/2000annualreview/pdfs/NHMFL2000AR-Geochemistry.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zofia Potocka''' née ''Clavone'' ({{lang-uk|Софія Костянтинівна Потоцька}}; 11 January 1760 – 24 November 1822) was a Greek slave courtesan and a Russian agent, later a Polish noble. She was famous in contemporary Europe for her beauty and adventurous life. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she was the lover of the Russian commander prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] and acted as an agent in Russian service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore (2006). Potemkin och Katarina den stora – en kejserliga förbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner) (in Swedish). prisma. {{ISBN|9789151844978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Compatriots of her time wrote: "She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women."

==Life==
===Early life===
Potocka was born in 1760 January 1 (January 11, New Style) in the Turkish city of [[Bursa]] to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of [[Phanar]] in [[Constantinople]] with her parents and sisters. 

Around 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. 

In May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, [[Boskamp Lyasopolskomu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help. The sister were claimed to descent from the noble aristocratic family Pantalisa Mavrokordato, who stemmed from the royal family of Greece and was related by blood to the rulers of Byzantium. 

Zofia and her sister settled in his palace and was given lessons in French. Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Boskamp-Lyasopolsky arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. 

The Polish Count Major [[Józef Witt]] learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boskamp-Lyasopolsky and married her in 1779.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 
Józef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianetska, and the couple lived a year in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], before departing for Europe in 1781.

===Europe===
Zofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of Berlin and Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Venice and, most famously, in Paris. She was celebrated as "The most beautiful woman in Europe" and known for her expression: "My eyes aches".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Her beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. 
  
At the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited Warsaw. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King Stanislas Augustus. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia Frederick II. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered [[Mozart]] to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. 
In one of his letters to his sister, the French queen Marie Antoinette, Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. 

Zofia saw [[Marie Antoinette]] at [[Petit Trianon]], which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King Louis XVIII, and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king Charles X respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  

On November 17, 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. 

===Russia===
In 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Slovakia and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. 

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of Catherine the Great, which lasted until his death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; At least during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1788)|Siege of Khotyn]], her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of [[Kherson|Cherson]], and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Later life===
In February 1796, Zofia arrived in Uman and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in Tulchin, she remarried [[Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki]], who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. 

During her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and [[Olga Potocka|Olga]] (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, [[Szczęsny Jerzy Potocki]], who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She also had an affair with the Russian governor, [[Nikolai Novosiltsov]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish "Illuminati" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. 
As a widow, she was by law only entitled to her [[dowry]] and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

As a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.

===Death===
In the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for [[Berlin]] to consult German doctors, where she died. 

She left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. 

Zofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in [[Talne]] with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.

Zofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.
