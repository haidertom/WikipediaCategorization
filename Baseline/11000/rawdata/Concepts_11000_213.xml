'''A Mathematical Programming Language''' ('''AMPL''') is an [[algebraic modeling language]] to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e., large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).&lt;ref name="ampl-book"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David Gay, and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL supports dozens of [[solver]]s, both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[commercial software]], including CBC, [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[Gurobi]], [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl]] files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

  | accessdate=2011-07-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the [[NEOS Server]] (formerly hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], currently hosted at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]&lt;ref name="neos-uwm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neos-guide.org/About/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Features==
AMPL features a mix of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulating optimization models occurs via declarative language elements such as sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives and constraints, which allow for concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AMPL for
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

To support re-use and simplify construction of large-scale optimization problems, AMPL allows separation of model and data.

AMPL supports a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Second-order cone programming]]
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory]] problems (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* [[Constraint programming]]&lt;ref name="cp-support"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL invokes a solver in a separate process which has these advantages:
* User can interrupt the solution process at any time
* Solver errors do not affect the interpreter
* 32-bit version of AMPL can be used with a 64-bit solver and vice versa
Interaction with the solver is done through a well-defined [[nl (format)|nl interface]].

==Availability==
[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]
AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit [[operating system]]s including [[Linux]], Mac [[OS X]], some [[Unix]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ampl.com/products/ampl/ AMPL page at AMPL Optimization Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator is proprietary software maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However, several online services exist, providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL.&lt;ref name="neos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neos-server.org/neos/|title=NEOS Server for Optimization|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/|title=Try AMPL!|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A free student version with limited functionality and a free full-featured version for academic courses are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|title=AMPL Downloads|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526013237/http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|archive-date=26 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL can be used from within [[Microsoft Excel]] via the [[SolverStudio]] Excel add-in.

The AMPL Solver Library (ASL), which allows reading nl files and provides the automatic differentiation, is open-source. It is used in many solvers to implement AMPL connection.

[[File:Sisyphus by von Stuck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Sisyphus]], the symbol of the absurdity of existence, painting by [[Franz Stuck]] (1920)]]

&lt;!-- Do not edit the definition of Absurdism without first discussing on the Talk page - thank you for helping to maintain a neutral point of view --&gt;

In [[philosophy]], "'''the Absurd'''" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|inherent value]] and [[meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. 

As a philosophy, '''absurdism''' furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-679-73373-6|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard|existentialist philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Stewart, Jon (2011). Kierkegaard and Existentialism. Farnham, England: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-1-4094-2641-7}}. pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon |title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. The aftermath of [[World War II]] provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of [[France]].

{{Also|Existentialism#The Absurd}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the [[meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]] of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942), respectively:

*[[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd. Rather, in the act of ending one's existence, one's existence only becomes more absurd.
*[[Religious]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]], or abstract belief in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] realm, being, or idea: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires an irrational but perhaps necessary religious "leap" into the intangible and empirically unprovable (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution, and others, as "philosophical suicide".
*Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve the greatest extent of one's freedom. By recognizing no religious or other moral constraints, and by revolting against the Absurd (through meaning-making) while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could find contentment through the transient personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1941}} Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to existentialism and nihilism==
Absurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the Absurd: the apparent meaninglessness in a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual's construction of his or her own meaning in life as well as the [[free will]] of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that "it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdists, following Camus's formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically ''in spite of'' the psychological tension of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Camus|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=What is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to live without escape and with integrity, in “revolt” and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus himself passionately worked to counter [[nihilism]], as he explained in his essay "[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]," while he also categorically rejected the label of "existentialist" in his essay "Enigma" and in the compilation ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus'', though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon|title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of [[existential nihilism]]: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe. Camus's own understanding of the world (e.g., "a benign indifference", in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress,{{example needed|date=November 2018}} however, sets him apart from the general existentialist trend.

Such a chart represents some of the overlap and tensions between existentialist and absurdist approaches to meaning.  While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other.  The existentialist, after all, doesn't deny the reality of death.  But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre's case, participation in a grand humanist project.

==Søren Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|Kierkegaard designed the relationship framework based (in part) on how a person reacts to [[existential despair|despair]]. Absurdist philosophy fits into the 'despair of defiance' rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Sickness Unto Death''. ''Kierkegaard wrote about all four viewpoints in his works at one time or another, but the majority of his work leaned towards what would later become absurdist and theistic existentialist views.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A century before [[Albert Camus|Camus]], the 19th century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:

{{quotation|What is the Absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The Absurd, or to act by virtue of the absurd, is to act upon faith ... I must act, but reflection has closed the road so I take one of the possibilities and say: This is what I do, I cannot do otherwise because I am brought to a standstill by my powers of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Dru, Alexander. ''The Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;|Kierkegaard, Søren|Journals|1849}}

Here is another example of the Absurd from his writings: {{Quotation|What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up. etc., has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being, in as much as all immediate recognizability is pre-Socratic paganism and from the Jewish point of view is idolatry.&lt;br&gt;—Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong 1992, p. 210}}

How can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: {{Quotation|I gladly undertake, by way of brief repetition, to emphasize what other pseudonyms have emphasized. The absurd is not the absurd or absurdities without any distinction (wherefore Johannes de Silentio: "How many of our age understand what the absurd is?"). The absurd is a category, and the most developed thought is required to define the Christian absurd accurately and with conceptual correctness. The absurd is a category, the negative criterion, of the divine or of the relationship to the divine. When the believer has faith, the absurd is not the absurd — faith transforms it, but in every weak moment it is again more or less absurd to him. The passion of faith is the only thing which masters the absurd — if not, then faith is not faith in the strictest sense, but a kind of knowledge. The absurd terminates negatively before the sphere of faith, which is a sphere by itself. To a third person the believer relates himself by virtue of the absurd; so must a third person judge, for a third person does not have the passion of faith. Johannes de Silentio has never claimed to be a believer; just the opposite, he has explained that he is not a believer — in order to illuminate faith negatively.&lt;br&gt;—''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'' X6B 79&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Naturalthinker.com|title=Søren Kierkegaard|url=http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/X_6_B.html|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard provides an example in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' (1843), which was published under the pseudonym ''[[Johannes de Silentio]]''. In the story of [[Abraham]] in the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Abraham is told by [[God]] to [[Binding of Isaac|kill his son]] [[Isaac]]. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act").&lt;ref&gt;Silentio, Johannes de. ''Fear and Trembling'', Denmark, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym ''[[Anti-Climacus]]''. Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance.&lt;ref&gt;''Sickness Unto Death'', Ch.3, part B, sec. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.

According to Kierkegaard in his autobiography ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.

==Albert Camus==
Though the notion of the 'absurd' pervades all [[Albert Camus]]'s writing, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a "divorce" between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand&amp;nbsp;– and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: [[suicide]], a [[leap of faith]], or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"/&gt;

For Camus, suicide is a "confession" that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is "too much." Suicide offers the most basic "way out" of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.

The absurd encounter can also arouse a "leap of faith," a term derived from one of Kierkegaard's early pseudonyms, ''Johannes de Silentio'' (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself),&lt;ref name=CC&gt;"The Kierkegaardian Leap" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard''.&lt;/ref&gt; where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a "leap of faith," one must act with the "virtue of the absurd" (as ''Johannes de Silentio'' put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. (Although at some point, one recognizes or encounters the existence of the Absurd and, in response, actively ignores it.) However, Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as "philosophical suicide," rejecting both this and physical suicide.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom&amp;nbsp;– and the opportunity to give life meaning&amp;nbsp;– lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. "To live without appeal,"&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.

Camus states in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'': "Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolt" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; "Freedom" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; "Passion" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.

==The meaning of life==
According to absurdism, humans historically attempt to find [[Meaning of life|meaning in their lives]]. Traditionally, this search results in one of two conclusions: either that life is meaningless, or life contains within it a purpose set forth by a [[deity|higher power]]—a belief in [[God]], or adherence to some [[religion]] or other abstract concept. 

===Elusion===
Camus perceives filling the void with some invented belief or meaning as a mere "act of eluding"&amp;mdash;that is, avoiding or escaping rather than acknowledging and embracing the Absurd. To Camus, elusion is a fundamental flaw in [[religion]], [[existentialism]], and various other schools of thought. If the individual eludes the Absurd, then he or she can never confront it.
Camus also concedes that elusion is the most common.

===God===
Even with a spiritual power as the answer to meaning, another question arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God. Camus notes, "I did not say 'excludes God', which would still amount to asserting".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 40, note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal meaning===
For Camus, the beauty people encounter in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning in their own lives, which may not be the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an [[irony|ironic]] distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.

===Freedom===
[[Liberty|Freedom]] cannot be achieved beyond what the absurdity of existence permits; however, the closest one can come to being absolutely free is through acceptance of the Absurd. Camus introduced the idea of "acceptance without resignation" as a way of dealing with the recognition of absurdity, asking whether or not man can "live without appeal", while defining a "conscious revolt" against the avoidance of absurdity of the world. In a world devoid of higher meaning or judicial afterlife, the human nature becomes as close to absolutely free as is humanly possible.

===Hope===
The rejection of hope, in absurdism, denotes the refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, has nothing to do with despair (meaning that the two terms are not [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so ''without'' hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method of evading the Absurd, and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest. In the words of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]'s [[epitaph]]: "I hope for nothing.  I fear nothing.  I am free."

===Integrity===
The absurdist is not guided by [[morality]], but rather, by their own [[integrity]]. The absurdist is, in fact, [[Amorality|amoral]] (though not necessarily [[Morality|immoral]]). The Absurdist's view of morality implies an unwavering sense of definite right and wrong at all times, while integrity implies honesty with one's self and consistency in the motivations of one's actions and decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">'''Audience superior position''' is a term in [[literary theory]] to describe when the audience of a narrative work knows more than one or more characters in the narrative work.&lt;ref name="Write to TV"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cook| first = Martie| title = Write to TV: Out of Your Head and Onto the Screen| publisher = Focal Press| year = 2007| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9_x98ufdB-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example in film might be when the audience knows the killer is hiding in the closet while the [[protagonist]] does not.

Another example of audience superior position is the use of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp48.Dramatic.Irony.html WordPlayer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the audience may know [[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]] is headed for a tragic ending before Oedipus himself does.

Audience superior may also be used for [[foreshadowing]] or dramatic tension. The audience is aware there is a shark in the film [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] long before the protagonists accept this fact.

==Audience inferior position==

'''Audience inferior position''' is when the audience knows less than one or more of the characters in a narrative work. A key example is in murder mysteries, when the detective solves the crime before the audience. If the audience were to solve the crime before the detective, the audience would lose all interest in following the story.

==Audience equal position==

Much of the time in narrative works, the audience knows exactly as much as the characters they are following, and are not given more or less information by the author.

'''Intracranial self-stimulation''' ('''ICSS''') is the operant conditioning method used to produce BSR in an experimental setting.  ICSS typically involves subjects with permanent electrode implants in one of several regions of the brain known to produce BSR when stimulated.  Subjects are trained to continuously respond for electrical stimulation of that brain region, which produces BSR.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlezon WA, Chartoff EH | title = Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in rodents to study the neurobiology of motivation | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = 2987–95 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18007634 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICSS studies have been particularly useful for examining the effects of various pharmacological manipulations on reward sensitivity.  ICSS has been utilized as a means to gauge addiction liability for drugs of many classes, including those which act on monoaminergic, opioid, and cholinergic neurotransmission.  These data correlate well with findings from [[self-administration]] studies on the addictive properties of drugs.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Negus SS, Miller LL | title = Intracranial self-stimulation to evaluate abuse potential of drugs | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 869–917 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24973197 | doi = 10.1124/pr.112.007419 | pmc=4081730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1953, [[James Olds]] and Peter Milner, of [[McGill University]], observed that rats preferred to return to the region of the test apparatus where they received direct electrical stimulation to the septal area of the brain.&lt;ref name="Olds and Milner 1954"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J, Milner P | title = Positive reinforcement produced by electrical stimulation of septal area and other regions of rat brain | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 419–27 | year = 1954 | pmid = 13233369 | doi = 10.1037/h0058775| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this demonstration, Olds and Milner inferred that the stimulation was rewarding, and through subsequent experiments, they confirmed that they could train rats to execute novel behaviors, such as lever pressing, in order to receive short pulse trains of brain stimulation.&lt;ref name="Olds and Milner 1954" /&gt; Olds and Milner discovered the reward mechanisms in the brain involved in positive reinforcement, and their experiments led to the conclusion that electrical stimulation could serve as an operant reinforcer.&lt;ref name="Olds and Milner 1954" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milner PM | title = Brain-stimulation reward: a review | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–36 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2044020 | doi = 10.1037/h0084275| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[B.F. Skinner]], operant reinforcement occurs when a behavior is followed by the presentation of a stimulus, and it is considered essential to the learning of response habits.&lt;ref name="Olds_1975"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J | title = Reward and Drive Neurons | journal = Brain Stimulation Reward | year = 1975 | volume = 1 | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their discovery enabled [[motivation]] and reinforcement to be understood in terms of their underlying physiology, and it led to further experimentation to determine the neural basis of reward and reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt; Since the initial discovery, the phenomenon of BSR has been demonstrated in all species tested, and Robert Heath similarly demonstrated that BSR can be applied to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heath RG | title = Electrical self-stimulation of the brain in man | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 120 | pages = 571–7 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14086435 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.120.6.571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain stimulation reinforcement ==
Early studies on the motivational effects of brain stimulation addressed two primary questions: 1. Which brain sites can be stimulated to produce the perception of reward? and 2. Which drugs influence the response to stimulation and via what mechanism?&lt;ref name="Wise_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Addictive drugs and brain stimulation reward | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 319–40 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8833446 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.19.030196.001535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the brain reward circuitry reveals that it consists of a distributed, multi-synaptic circuit that determines both BSR and natural reward function.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; The natural drives that motivate and shape behavior reach the reward circuitry trans-synaptically through the peripheral senses of sight, sound, taste, smell, or touch.  However, experimentally-induced BSR more directly activates the reward circuitry and bypasses transduction through peripheral sensory pathways.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; For this reason, electrical brain stimulation provides a tool for identifying the reward circuitry within the [[central nervous system]] with some degree of anatomical and neurochemical specificity.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; Studies involving these two forms of laboratory reward showed stimulation of a broad range of limbic and diencephalic structures could be rewarding as well as implicated the [[dopamine]]-containing neurons of the [[mesolimbic]] dopamine system in motivational function.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; The motivational effect of intracranial self-stimulation varies substantially depending on the placement site of the surgically implanted electrode during electrical stimulation, and animals will work to stimulate different neural sites depending on their current state.&lt;ref name="Olds_1958"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J | title = Self-stimulation of the brain; its use to study local effects of hunger, sex, and drugs | journal = Science | volume = 127 | issue = 3294 | pages = 315–24 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13506579 | doi = 10.1126/science.127.3294.315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, animals that work to initiate brain stimulation will also work to terminate the stimulation.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

== Relationship to natural rewards and drives ==
The relationship between BSR and natural rewards (e.g. food, water and copulation) has long been debated, and much of the early research on BSR is focused on their respective similarities and differences.  BSR is facilitated through the same reinforcement pathway activated by natural rewards.   Self-stimulation can exert robust activation of central reward mechanisms due to more direct action than natural rewards, which initially activate [[peripheral nerves]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; BSR to the [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) through either electrical or chemical means activates key components of the reward pathway also activated by natural rewards.  When specific regions of the [[hypothalamus]] are electrically stimulated, it elicits reward-related behaviors such as eating, drinking, or copulation responses.&lt;ref name="Olds_1975" /&gt;

Natural rewards are associated with a state of deprivation which results from unmet needs or desires (e.g. hunger).  These states drive instinctual, motivated behaviors like food consumption.  It has been argued that this is not the case with BSR, as it does not meet an intrinsic survival-based need.  BSR also notably lacks an established neural representation in memory that naturally facilitates the learning of reward expectancy. Both of these effects lead to diminished response rate for BSR in the early trials of a series; however, experiments have also shown that extinguished behavior can be quickly reinstated by a [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] stimulation that refreshes the short-term association involved in reward expectancy.&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt; Studies on BSR indicate that reinforcing brain stimulation may activate the natural pathways associated with natural drives as well as stimulate the reinforcement pathways that are usually activated by natural rewards.

=== Strength of drive ===
Rats will perform lever-pressing at rates of several thousand responses per hour for days in order to obtain direct electrical stimulation of the [[lateral hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="Olds_1958" /&gt; Multiple studies have demonstrated that rats will perform reinforced behaviors at the exclusion of all other behaviors.  Experiments have shown rats will forgo food to the point of starvation in order to work for brain stimulation or intravenous [[cocaine]] when both food and stimulation are offered concurrently for a limited time each day.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt;  Rats will also cross electrified grids to press a lever, and they are willing to withstand higher levels of shock to obtain electrical stimulation than to obtain food .&lt;ref name="Olds_1958" /&gt;

=== Satiation ===
Satiation experiments in rats have revealed that BSR does not produce satiety. Olds demonstrated that this lack of satiation associated with BSR allows animals to self-stimulate to sheer exhaustion and that satiation is dependent on the location of the electrical stimulation.&lt;ref name="Olds_1958" /&gt; In a 48-hour satiation test, rats with [[hypothalamic]] electrodes self-stimulated to exhaustion and showed no intrinsic satiation tendencies, whereas [[telencephalic]] electrodes showed radical slowing of self-stimulation after 4 to 8 hours.  The insatiability of BSR is closely related to the strength of drive.  While a natural reward, like food, is met with a feeling of being full (satiety), BSR does not have a comparable correlate.  This allows for BSR to be experienced indefinitely, or in the case of ICSS, until exhaustion.

=== Addiction ===
Addiction is a chronic brain disorder consisting of compulsive drug-taking and seeking that is maintained despite detrimental effects on various aspects of life including health, relationships, and work. Laboratory procedures can establish compulsive self-administration habits of seeking and ingesting that qualify as addictive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; Rodents and [[Primate|non-human primates]] have been shown to work in a compulsive manner to receive intravenous injections of stimulants, and when access to the drugs is not limited, they will self-administer drugs to the point of severe weight loss and death.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozarth_1985"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bozarth MA, Wise RA | title = Toxicity associated with long-term intravenous heroin and cocaine self-administration in the rat | journal = JAMA | volume = 254 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4039767 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360010087032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to self-administration behavior, responding for intracranial brain stimulation has a highly compulsive component which is characteristic of an addicted state. BSR is hypothesized to be so effective in establishing compulsive habits due to its more direct activation of the reward pathway, bypassing transmission through sensory pathways which occurs in response to natural rewards.  Delayed reinforcement following a response for BSR decreases how strongly this behavior is reinforced and to what extent it continues.  A delay of one second, for example, between a lever-press and reward delivery (stimulation) can reduce response levels.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; BSR offers insights into the neural circuitry involved in reinforcement and compulsive behavior.

== Anatomy of reward==
Mapping and lesion studies on BSR were designed to determine the location of reward-relevant neurons as well as determine the signal pathways that are directly affected by brain stimulation. The site of intracranial self-stimulation leads to substantially different behavioral characteristics. Sites along the length of the [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) through the lateral and posterior [[hypothalamus]], the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), and into the [[pons]] are associated with the strongest reward effects of stimulation.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Lateral hypothalamus===
The [[lateral hypothalamus]] is a portion of the hypothalamus, and brain stimulation to this area at the level of the medial forebrain bundle produces the highest response rates and subsequently the highest reward potency in rodents.  Lesions in this region or along its boundary cause a loss of positive drive-reward behaviors as well as all other operant drive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Olds_1975" /&gt;

===Medial forebrain bundle===
The [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) is the location of the most frequently investigated brain stimulation reward sites, and it is composed of a complex bundle of [[axons]] projecting from the basal [[olfactory]] regions and the [[septal nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt; MFB is not the sole anatomical substrate responsible for reinforcing brain stimulation; however, it is the main tract for the ascending dopamine fibers, and it functions to relay information from the VTA to the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The rewarding effect of MFB stimulation is mediated via the activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Mesolimbic pathway===
The [[mesolimbic pathway]] connects the VTA to the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The nucleus accumbens is located in the ventral [[striatum]] and integrates information from [[Mesocortical pathway|cortical]] and limbic brain structures to mediate behaviors the reinforce reward.&lt;ref name="Kokarovtseva et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kokarovtseva L, Jaciw-Zurakiwsky T, Mendizabal Arbocco R, Frantseva MV, Perez Velazquez JL | title = Excitability and gap junction-mediated mechanisms in nucleus accumbens regulate self-stimulation reward in rats | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 159 | issue = 4 | pages = 1257–63 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19409225 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major target for the dopaminergic projections from the VTA, a group of neurons located close to the midline on the floor of the [[midbrain]].  The VTA is the origin of [[dopaminergic]] cell bodies that comprise the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt;

BSR has been shown to result in the release of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens, which also occurs in response to natural rewards such as food or sex.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Indirect activation===
[[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] data suggest stimulation of the MFB or VTA does not directly activate dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway.  These data suggest BSR is facilitated by initial excitation of descending, [[myelinated]] neurons which then activate the ascending, unmyelinated neurons of the VTA.  Excitatory, [[cholinergic]] inputs to the VTA are thought to play a role in this indirect activation, but the neuroanatomical components of this circuit have yet to be fully characterized.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

== Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedures ==
=== Initial training===
Since the initial demonstration of BSR by Olds and Milner, experiments in rodents record ICSS responding to quantify motivation to receive stimulation.  Subjects undergo stereotaxic surgery to permanently implant either a monopolar or bipolar electrode to the desired brain region.  Electrodes are connected to a stimulating apparatus at the time of the experiment.

The first portion of an ICSS experiment involves training subjects to respond for stimulation using a fixed-ratio 1 (FR-1) reinforcement schedule (1 response = 1 reward). In experiments involving rats, subjects are trained to press a lever for stimulation, and the rate of lever-pressing is typically the [[dependent variable]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;  In ICSS studies using mice, a response wheel is usually used instead of a lever, as mice do not consistently perform lever-pressing behaviors.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;  Each quarter turn of the response wheel is recorded and rewarded with stimulation. The rewarding stimulus in BSR experiments is typically a train of short-duration pulses separated by interval pulses,&lt;ref name="Sonnenschein et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonnenschein B, Conover K, Shizgal P | title = Growth of brain stimulation reward as a function of duration and stimulation strength | journal = Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 978–94 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14570548 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7044.117.5.978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be manipulated experimentally using the [[independent variables]] of stimulation amplitude, frequency, and pulse [[Time|duration]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Establishing minimum effective current===
The amplitude (current) of stimulation determines the population of neurons being activated by the implanted electrode. In certain approaches, this is adjusted for every subject due to minor variability in electrode placement, and therefore a slightly different population of affected neurons.&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt;  Following FR1 training, it is typical to establish a minimum, threshold current which produces sufficient levels of ICSS responding (about 40 responses per minute).  This is called a discrete-trial current intensity procedure.&lt;ref name = "Phillips_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips TJ, Reed C | title = Targeting GABAB receptors for anti-abuse drug discovery | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1307–17 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25195620 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2014.956076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marcus | first = Richard | last2 = Kornetsky | first2 = Conan | name-list-format = vanc | date = March 1974 | title = Negative and positive intracranial reinforcement tresholds: Effects of morphine | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 1–13 | doi = 10.1007/BF00421282 | journal=Psychopharmacologia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each discrete trial consists of non-contingent stimulation at a certain amplitude followed by a brief window during which the animal can respond for more stimulation.  Effective currents for BSR elicit responding above a certain rate (3 out of 4 trials, for example).  The lowest current the animal responds sufficiently to is deemed the minimum effective current.  This is done at a constant frequency, typically at the higher end of the frequency range employed in ICSS studies (140–160&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

Within-subject study design is often implemented to help eliminate variability introduced by electrode placement.  Between-subject study design requires rigorous [[Histology|histologic]] verification of electrode placement to ensure consistency between experimental groups.  Subjects with imperfect electrode placement require a higher simulation amplitude to activate the reward circuitry and produce ICSS responding.  Subjects with ideal anatomical placement will respond at lower stimulation amplitudes.  This corrective process is limited, however, since increasing the population of activated neurons can result in off-target activation of neighboring circuitry.  This is often culminated in undesired motor side effects upon stimulation, due to the adjacency of the MFB to the [[internal capsule]], a bundle of axons carrying descending motor information to the [[brainstem]].  Inadvertent stimulation of these axons can lead to motor output such as movement of the head or paw twitching.&lt;ref name="Liebman_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liebman JM | title = Discriminating between reward and performance: a critical review of intracranial self-stimulation methodology | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–72 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6132357 | doi = 10.1016/0149-7634(83)90007-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt;

=== Frequency-rate responding ===
At a constant minimum effective current, ICSS responding is recorded over a series of trials which vary in stimulation frequency.  Each trial consists of a short priming phase of non-contingent stimulation, a response phase where responses are recorded and rewarded with stimulation, and a short time-out phase where responses are not recorded and no stimulation is delivered.  This is repeated for a series of 10-15 different ascending or descending frequencies, in .05 log-unit increments, which range anywhere from 20–200&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;

While the amplitude of the stimulation influences which neurons are being stimulated, the frequency of stimulation determines the firing rate induced in that neuronal population.  Generally, increasing stimulation frequency increases the firing rate in the target population.  This is associated with higher ICSS response rates, eventually reaching a maximum level at the maximum firing rate, limited by the refractory properties of neurons.

=== Other factors ===
The independent variables of stimulation train and pulse duration can also be varied to determine how each affects ICSS response rates.  Longer train durations produce more vigorous responding up to a point, after which rate of responding varies inversely with train length.  This is due to lever-pressing for additional stimulation before the previously earned train has finished.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

The reinforcement schedule can also be manipulated to determine how motivated an animal is to receive stimulation, reflected by how hard they are willing to work to earn it.  This can be done by increasing the number of responses required to receive a reward (FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, etc.) or by implementing a progressive-ratio schedule, where the number of required responses continually increases.  The number of required responses increases for each trial until the animal fails to reach the required number of responses.  This is considered the "break-point" and is a good indication of motivation related to reward magnitude.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

=== Curve-shift analysis ===
Stimulation intensity, pulse duration, or pulse frequency can be varied to determine dose-response functions ICSS responding using curve-shift analysis.  This approach generally resembles traditional pharmacological dose-response curve where the frequency of stimulation, rather than the dose of a drug, is examined.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;  This method allows for quantitative analysis of reward-modulating treatments on response rates in comparison to baseline conditions.  Lower stimulation frequencies fail to sustain ICSS responding at a probability above chance. Response rates increase rapidly over a dynamic range of stimulation frequencies as the frequency increases, until a maximum response rate is reached.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt;  Changes in the rate of response over this range reflects changes in the magnitude of the reward.&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt; Rate-frequency, rate-intensity, or rate-duration functions make inferences about the potency and efficacy of stimulation, as well as elucidate how drugs alter the rewarding impact of stimulation.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

Curve-shift analysis is often used in pharmacological studies to compare baseline response rates to those following drug administration. The maximum response rate during baseline conditions is typically used to normalize data in a frequency-rate curve to a maximum control rate (MCR).  More specifically, the number of responses for any given trial is divided by the highest number of responses recorded in a baseline condition trial, which is then multiplied by 100. In an experimental condition, if the MCR falls below 100% at the highest stimulation frequencies, it is thought to reflect an impacted capability or motivation to respond, potentially induced by a drug with sedative or aversive properties.  Shifts above 100% of the MCR indicate improved ability or motivation to respond, potentially induced by a drug with rewarding or stimulant properties.&lt;ref name="Liebman_1983" /&gt;

Sensitivity of the neural circuitry to the rewarding properties of stimulation is assessed by analyzing left- or right-shifts in the M50, or the frequency at which 50% of the maximum number of responses was recorded.  Reaching 50% of the MCR at a lower frequency is characteristic of a left-shift in the frequency-rate curve and sensitization of the reward circuitry to stimulation.  An increase in the M50 indicates that a greater stimulation frequency was required to reach 50% of the MCR, and the reward circuitry has been desensitized by the experimental manipulation.  Another way of analyzing the frequency-rate curve between control and experimental conditions is to do a linear regression through the ascending data points in a plot of raw data (which has not been normalized to the MCR).  The point where y=0, or the x-intercept, is called the threshold frequency or theta zero (θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  This is the frequency at which ICSS response rates are equal to 0 (and any frequency above this will theoretically elicit ICSS responding).&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

== Modulation with drugs ==
There are several major drug classes which have been studied extensively in relation to ICSS behavior: monoaminergic drugs, opioids, cholinergic drugs, GABAergic drugs, as well as a small number of drugs from other classes.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;  These studies generally compare ICSS responding at baseline and following drug administration.  Typically, the frequency-rate approach is used to determine changes in the M50 or θ&lt;sub&gt;0.&lt;/sub&gt;

Drugs with increased addiction liability generally decrease the stimulation threshold for ICSS responding, while drugs with [[Aversive salience|aversive]] properties generally increase the stimulation threshold to achieve ICSS responding.  These studies provide insight into the specific neurochemical mechanisms involved in the facilitation of BSR, and how reward perception can be modulated by pharmacologically altering the activity of specific neurotransmitter systems.  Pharmacological manipulation of these systems can have either a direct or indirect effect on the activity of the reward circuitry.  Understanding drug-specific effects on ICSS response thresholds has helped elucidate how different neurotransmitter systems influence the reward circuitry by either potentiating or suppressing sensitivity to rewarding stimulation and influencing motivation to perform reward-associated behaviors.

BSR and drugs of addiction produce their rewarding effects through shared neuroanatomical and neurochemical mechanisms.  Studies using lesion, pharmacological, and anatomical mapping of the brain have revealed that many drugs of abuse (e.g. [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]], [[opioids]], [[nicotine]], etc.) activate the reward circuitry of the MFB, which is similarly activated by stimulation to achieve BSR. The [[Axons|neuronal axons]] of the mesolimbic dopamine system, a key component of the reward circuitry, generally have high thresholds for stimulation.  However, these thresholds can be increased or decreased by drug administration, influencing sensitivity to intracranial stimulation and ICSS behavior.

=== Monoaminergic drugs ===
[[File:Frequency_rate_chart_example.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frequency_rate_chart_example.jpg|border|right|500x500px|Example frequency-rate plot for 10 trials over increasing stimulation frequencies. Hypothetical data (which reflects established concepts in ICSS procedures) is plotted as the percent maximum responses for any given trial during a sequence. The blue line represents hypothetical data at baseline, while the black line represents hypothetical data following administration of 10 mg/kg cocaine to the subject. This reflects the characteristic "left-shift" of the frequency-rate curve following administration of a drug which increases dopaminergic transmission in the reward pathway.]]
The effects of drugs which alter the neurotransmission of dopamine, [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]] have been studied extensively in relation to BSR.  Neurochemical studies have shown that BSR results in the release of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips AG, Blaha CD, Fibiger HC | title = Neurochemical correlates of brain-stimulation reward measured by ex vivo and in vivo analyses | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 13 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 99–104 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2530478 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80017-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is generally potentiated following administration of drugs which themselves increase the amount of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, such as [[cocaine]], which inhibits re-uptake of dopamine to the intracellular space by blocking its [[Dopamine transporter|transporter]]. Conversely, these levels are decreased and the rewarding properties of BSR are blocked following administration of drugs which antagonize dopamine receptors or reduce the amount of extracellular dopamine, by promoting either degradation or [[Reuptake|re-uptake]] of the neurotransmitter.  While dopamine is generally considered to be the main neurotransmitter implicated in the reward system, it is often not the only neurotransmitter affected by addictive, monoaminergic drugs. Importantly, the circuitry involved in BSR is multi-synaptic and not exclusively dopaminergic.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; This introduces potential for modulation by other neurotransmitter systems at different stages in the transmission of the reward signal.

Additionally, drugs which affect monoamine transmission vary in their selectivity.  For example, drugs with high selectivity for increasing dopamine and norepinephrine transmission relative to serotonin transmission tend to have highly addictive properties. Amphetamine and cocaine share this selectivity profile, and administration of these drugs generally results in a left-shift in M50 and θ&lt;sub&gt;0,&lt;/sub&gt; indicating sensitization of the reward circuitry and high abuse potential.  This characteristic leftward-shift of M50 in response to a moderate dose of cocaine is illustrated in a hypothetical data set in Figure 1. Note that the maximum response rate is reached at a lower frequency than it is at baseline, and there is a significant response rate at the lowest frequency, which did not produce responding under baseline conditions.  Even following chronic administration of methamphetamine or cocaine, there is little to no tolerance to ICSS facilitation.  After chronic treatment is stopped, however, there is a withdrawal-induced depression of ICSS responding which can be reversed by re-administering the drug.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

Drugs with more balanced selectivity for dopamine/norepinephrine and serotonin transmission, such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ([[MDMA]]), tend to be less addictive, and they have mixed effects on ICSS responding depending on dose and stimulation frequency. Serotonin selective drugs, however, tend to result in either a lack of ICSS potentiation or depression of ICSS responding (a right-shift in frequency-rate curve), and these drugs are generally considered to be less addictive. One such example is fenfluramine, which was previously marketed as an appetite suppressant.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt; Dopamine antagonists generally result in the depression of ICSS responding and a rightward-shift in the frequency-rate curve. This suggests decreased BSR and possibly increased aversive properties of the stimulation.  Following chronic treatment with a dopamine antagonist, there is withdrawal-induced facilitation of ICSS, the opposite effect of what is observed following chronic treatment with stimulants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barr AM, Markou A, Phillips AG | title = A 'crash' course on psychostimulant withdrawal as a model of depression | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 475–82 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12368072 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-6147(02)02086-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

=== Opioids ===
Drugs which act on the [[opioid]] system generally vary in selectivity for the mu (μ), delta (δ), and kappa (κ) opioid receptors.  Their addictive properties are highly dependent on these selectivities. Generally speaking, high potency mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists have high abuse potential, while kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonists generally produce a dysphoric state.  Morphine, a MOR agonist, was one of the earliest studied drugs at the advent of ICSS and BSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J, Travis RP | title = Effects of chlorpromazine, meprobamate, pentobarbital and morphine on self-stimulation | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 128 | pages = 397–404 | date = April 1960 | pmid = 14428622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   High potency MOR agonists like morphine have a somewhat varied effect on ICSS responding despite having high abuse potential, resulting in both potentiation and depression.  The effect these drugs have on ICSS responding has been found to be highly dependent on dose, pretreatment time, and previous opioid exposure.  Various studies on the effect of MOR-selective drugs including morphine, heroin, fentanyl, methadone, and hydrocodone have found mixed effects on ICSS responding.  Low doses of these drugs have been found to elicit weak facilitation of ICSS, while high doses result in a biphasic ICSS profile, consisting of a higher threshold for ICSS at lower frequencies followed by ICSS potentiation at higher frequencies. Upon chronic administration of high-potency MOR agonists at low doses, there is no tolerance to ICSS facilitation.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Ralph U. | last1 = Esposito | first2 = Conan | last2 = Kornetsky | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 1978 | title=Opioids and rewarding brain stimulation | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–122 | doi = 10.1016/0149-7634(78)90052-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opioid receptor antagonists, such as [[naloxone]], can reverse the effects of both opioid receptor agonists on ICSS responding and the potentiating effects of psychostimulants like methamphetamine.  Naloxone, which is a competitive antagonist of all opioid receptor sub-types, does not influence ICSS responding when administered on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer GJ | title = Opiate antagonists and rewarding brain stimulation | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17 | date = 1988 | pmid = 3287237 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(88)80068-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  KOR agonism, typically associated with dysphoric states, more consistently results in a depression of ICSS responding.  The KOR agonist salvinorin-A, for example, causes an overall decrease in ICSS response rates at lower stimulation frequencies.  Repeated administration does not produce tolerance to ICSS depression.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;  The effects of delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists/antagonists on ICSS are less clear.  One DOR agonist, SNC80, has been found to cause ICSS depression, but there is counter-evidence suggesting some delta agonists might have weak ICSS facilitation properties.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

=== Cholinergic drugs ===
Cholinergic drugs have been less extensively studied than monoamines and opioids.  The most commonly studied cholinergic drug is [[nicotine]], the highly-addictive, psychoactive substance in cigarettes.  Nicotine is an agonist of [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAchRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels.  The addictive properties of nicotine have been found to be associated with agonism specifically of the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2]] sub-type of nicotinic receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melroy-Greif WE, Stitzel JA, Ehringer MA | title = Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: upregulation, age-related effects and associations with drug use | journal = Genes, Brain, and Behavior | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–107 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26351737 | pmc = 4780670 | doi = 10.1111/gbb.12251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have confirmed that low doses of nicotine result in ICSS facilitation, while higher doses result in ICSS depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Itasaka M, Hironaka N, Miyata H | title = [Behavioral characteristics of nicotine seeking: a role of the nicotine-conditioned effects and other mechanisms] | journal = Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai Zasshi = Japanese Journal of Alcohol Studies &amp; Drug Dependence | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 135–43 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26502572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;  Chronic treatment with nicotine does not result in tolerance to ICSS facilitation at low doses, but does result in tolerance to the depressive effects of high doses.  Withdrawal-induced depression of ICSS facilitation at low doses is also observed, as in MOR agonists and monoamine stimulants.  It should be noted that the effects of nicotine treatment on ICSS response thresholds and maximum response rates are not as significant as they are in the case of many addictive MOR agonists and monoamine stimulants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bauzo RM, Bruijnzeel AW | title = Animal models of nicotine withdrawal: intracranial self-stimulation and somatic signs of withdrawal | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 829 | pages = 257–68 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22231819 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-458-2_16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

=== GABAergic drugs ===
GABAergic transmission is inhibitory, and the two main receptors for GABA are [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Drugs which act on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels, are more widely studied, as they generally produce more robust effects on [[sedation]] and [[anxiety]], and they are commonly prescribed for therapeutic uses.  Several of these drugs have addictive properties, including several [[benzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturate]]s. Low doses of these drugs generally result in ICSS facilitation, while higher doses can result in depression of ICSS and an overall decrease in the maximum response rate.  The latter is likely related to an impaired ability to respond due to the sedative and hypnotic properties of these drugs.  Ethanol influences GABA receptor activity, and has been found to moderately facilitate ICSS,&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt; despite older publications suggesting these findings are inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornetsky C, Bain GT, Unterwald EM, Lewis MJ | title = Brain stimulation reward: effects of ethanol | journal = Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 609–16 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 2852475 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1988.tb00250.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists and [[Allosteric modulator|positive allosteric modulators]] have been found to result in ICSS depression and have been found to inhibit the reinforcing effects of several drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine, reversing the ICSS facilitation these drugs typically cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlachou S, Markou A | title = GABAB receptors in reward processes | journal = Advances in Pharmacology | volume = 58 | pages = 315–71 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20655488 | doi = 10.1016/S1054-3589(10)58013-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Clinical and pre-clinical evidence ==
Mechanisms of BSR offer a tool that provides insight into the way the brain governs behavior through motivation and reinforcement, especially in regard to addictive and compulsive behaviors. ICSS studies of BSR have proven to be a robust measure of reward sensitivity, and have potential to help assess the abuse liability of various future therapeutics.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;  Additionally, ICSS studies have potential to be used to gauge how reward sensitivity is affected by genetic factors associated with addictive disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu C, McClellan J | title = Genetics of Substance Use Disorders | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–85 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27338962 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2016.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang J, Li MD | title = Converging findings from linkage and association analyses on susceptibility genes for smoking and other addictions | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–1008 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27166759 | pmc = 4956568 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2016.67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi HD, Shin WG | title = Meta-analysis of the association between a serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and smoking cessation | journal = Psychiatric Genetics | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–91 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26886943 | doi = 10.1097/YPG.0000000000000116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drugs which have been found to prevent ICSS facilitation have potential to be developed and therapeutically implemented to reduce the risk of addictive disorders in a clinical setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiamulera C, Padovani L, Corsi M | title = Drug discovery for the treatment of substance use disorders: novel targets, repurposing, and the need for new paradigms | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 35 | pages = 120–124 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28874314 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2017.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Phillips_2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3499">In [[statistical mechanics]], '''configuration entropy''' is the portion of a system's [[entropy]] that is related to the position of its constituent particles rather than to their [[velocity]] or [[momentum]].  It is physically related to the number of ways of arranging all the [[particle]]s of the system while maintaining some overall set of specified system properties, such as [[energy]].

It can be shown&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{ cite book
 | last = Young | first = Hugh
 |author2=Roger Freedman
 | year = 2008
 | title = University Physics
 | edition = 12th
 | publisher = Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the variation of configuration entropy of [[thermodynamic systems]] (e.g., ideal gas, and other systems with a vast number of internal degrees of freedom) in [[thermodynamic process]]es is equivalent to the variation of the ''macroscopic entropy'' defined as ''dS = δQ/T'', where ''δQ'' is the [[heat]] exchanged between the system and the surrounding media, and ''T'' is temperature. Therefore, a change in configuration entropy corresponds to the same change in macroscopic entropy.

== Calculation ==
The configurational entropy in the [[microcanonical ensemble]] is related to the number of possible configurations W at a given energy E by [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;S = k_B \, \ln W,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''W'' is the number of possible configurations. In a more general formulation, if a system can be in states ''n'' with probabilities ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the configurational entropy of the system is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S = - k_B \, \sum_{n=1}^W P_n \ln P_n, &lt;/math&gt; 
which in the perfect disorder limit (all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''W'') leads to Boltzmann's formula, while in the opposite limit (one configuration with probability 1), the entropy vanishes. This formulation is called the [[Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)#Gibbs_entropy_formula|Gibbs entropy formula]] and is analogous to that of [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon's information entropy]].

The mathematical field of [[combinatorics]], and in particular the [[mathematics]] of [[combination]]s and [[permutation]]s is highly important in the calculation of configurational entropy.  In particular, this field of mathematics offers formalized approaches for calculating the number of ways of choosing or arranging discrete objects; in this case, [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s.  However, it is important to note that the positions of molecules are not strictly speaking ''discrete'' above the quantum level.  Thus a variety of approximations may be used in discretizing a system to allow for a purely combinatorial approach.  Alternatively, integral methods may be used in some cases to work directly with continuous position functions.

A second approach (most often in computer simulations, but also analytically) is to determine the change in configurational entropy using the [[Widom insertion method]].

{{Economics sidebar}}
The '''credibility thesis''' is a proposed [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] theoretical framework for understanding how societal [[institution]]s or social rules come about and evolve. It posits that institutions emerge from intentional institution-building but never in the originally intended form.&lt;ref name=ho2014&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ho |first= Peter |last2= |first2= |date=September 2014 |title= The "credibility thesis" and its application to property rights: (In)Secure land tenure, conflict and social welfare in China |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837713001889 |journal= Land Use Policy |publisher= |volume=40 |issue= |pages=13–27 |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.09.019 |access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, institutional development is [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenous]] and [[Spontaneous order|spontaneously ordered]] and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility,&lt;ref name=Grabel&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grabel |first= Ilene |last2= |first2= |date= |title= The political economy of 'policy credibility': the new-classical macroeconomics and the remaking of emerging economies |url= http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/1.abstract |journal= Cambridge Journal of Economics |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi= 10.1093/cje/24.1.1|access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve rather than their theoretical or ideological form. The credibility thesis can be applied to explain, for example, why purported institutional improvements do not take hold as part of [[structural adjustment]] programs, while other economies in the developing world deliver growth despite absence of clear and strong market mechanisms such as indisputable private property rights or clearly delineated and registered [[land tenure]].

== Postulates of the credibility thesis ==
According to the credibility thesis, institutional persistence, meaning the survival and change of particular institutions through time is determined by the function of the institution and [[Actant|actors]]' expectations of the institution to play that function. The Credibility Thesis has put forward “that what ultimately determines the performance of institutions is not their form in terms of formality, privatization, or security, but their spatially and temporally defined function. In different wording, institutional function presides over form; the former can be expressed by its credibility, that is, the perceived social support at a given time and space.”&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; In this sense, the thesis predicts that institutions that persist over time likely are credible, thus functional. If not, they would have changed or gone extinct. This principle holds for whatever form an institution may assume, regardless whether it is formal or informal, public or private, secure or insecure.

Changes in institutional arrangements, such as changes from informal [[land tenure]] and [[Housing#Informal housing in developing countries|informal housing]] to a formalized real estate market or gradually declining prevalence of formal marriage or [[Custom (law)|customary rights]], are brought about by rule-making in a multi-actor playing field, where even the strongest actors cannot fully dictate institutional arrangements.In effect, when powerful actors exogenously impose institutions that contradict the evolutionary flow of endogenously emerged functions, the newly designed arrangements will invariably develop into "empty institutions" and "non credible" institutions.&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1145–1176"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Empty institutions, non-credibility and pastoralism: China's grazing ban, mining and ethnicity | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Taylor &amp; Franci | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1145–1176 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1239617 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1239617 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An institution that appears stable and unchanging over time is often alleged to exist in an equilibrium wherein actors' conflicting interests on what form the institution should take are locked in a [[frozen conflict]]. For example, whether land holdings should be registered in a cadastre or if informal exchange of payment for use rights can suffice as confirmation of a land sale, constitute two possible institutional arrangements and either can be beneficial to different actors' interests. That no actor perceives an immediate opportunity to change the arrangement to their advantage is a sign of the credibility of the assignment and the source of the equilibrium of institutional arrangement. However, in actuality disequilibrium characterises institutional arrangements and equilibrium is transitory and rare. What is perceived as persistence of institutions is, in fact, the occurrence of infinitesimally small institutional changes over time under a veneer of apparent stability. In this context, the credibility thesis is predicated upon the notion of dynamic disequilibrium. It is also why in this respect the credibility theory is juxtaposed to [[structural functionalism]], which is based on presupposed societal equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Parsons 1985 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Parsons | first=Talcott | title=Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution : selected writings | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-226-64749-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons 1964 p.

A series of underlying postulates for the credibility thesis have been proposed:&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=An endogenous theory of property rights: opening the black box of institutions | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Informa UK | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1121–1144 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1253560 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1253560 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Institutions are the resultant of unintentional development. Although actors have intentions, there is no agency that can externally or exogenously design institutions, as actors' actions are part of the same endogenous game.&lt;ref name="Ho 1087–1118"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ho |first= Peter |last2= |first2= |date=19 December 2013 |title= In defense of endogenous, spontaneously ordered development: institutional functionalism and Chinese property rights |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2013.866553 |journal= Journal of Peasant Studies |publisher= |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1087–1118 |doi= 10.1080/03066150.2013.866553 |access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions emerge as an unanticipated outcome of actors' multitudinous interactions, in effect, are the result of an autonomous, ''Unintended Intentionality''.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Unmaking China's Development | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2017-10-13 | isbn=978-1-316-14561-6 | doi=10.1017/9781316145616 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Institutional change is driven by disequilibrium. Contrary to the notion that institutions settle around equilibrium, actors' interactions are seen as an ever-changing and conflicting process in which stable status is never reached. One could see it as a "Dynamic Disequilibrium" or institutional change as perpetual alteration, yet, with alternating speeds of change; sometimes, imperceptibly slow, sometimes, sudden and with shocks.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"/&gt;
* Institutional Form is subordinate to Function. In other words, functional adaptation as evident through the use and disuse of institutions over time and space is what matters for understanding their role in development, not their appearance.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt;

"Given that all involved actors are constantly interested in changing institutional design, credibility cannot be measured by directly asking respondents whether they find an institution credible.

Instead it has to be operationalized through [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]], such as the level of conflict that an institution generates, the extent of 'institutional robustness' expressed as a function of institutional lifespan and flexibility, the degree to which an institution facilitates or frustrates overall [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], political and [[Culture change|cultural change]], and the extent to which an institution fulfils the functions it ought to perform in the eyes of social actors." &lt;ref name="KremerLieshout2009"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ho|first=Peter|editor-last=Kremer | editor-first=Monique | title=Doing good or doing better: development policies in a globalizing world | publisher=Amsterdam University Press | location=Amsterdam | year=2009 |chapter=Beyond Development Orthodoxy: Chinese Lessons in Pragmatism and Institutional Change| isbn=978-90-8964-107-6 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ''opening of the black box'' of institutions is possible using [[Multimethodology|mixed methods]] to describe institutions in detail over time and space, which serves as an ''archaeology of institutions''. The archaeology of institutions can be understood as "an approach by which the change of institutions is meticulously recorded, interpreted and studied through the collection of data from every possible source, regardless of whether that is socio-economic, historical, ethno-anthropological, geographical, psychological or legal-political." &lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144" /&gt; An example of this, is the history of China's titling&lt;ref name="Ho2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Peter|title=Myths of tenure security and titling: Endogenous, institutional change in China's development|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=47|year=2015|pages=352–364|issn=0264-8377|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and housing ownership.&lt;ref name="PeterHo2017Cities"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ho | first=Peter | title=Who owns China's housing?

The proxies that can be used to measure credibility include the following:

* Actors' aggregate perceptions of institutions, which can be operationalized according to the FAT Institutional Framework (in other words, an assessment of Formal, Actual and Targeted institutions);&lt;ref name="Nor-Hisham Ho 2016 pp. 1177–1205" /&gt;
*Actors' aggregate perceptions of conflict generated by institutions in terms of "incidence, frequency, intensity (e.g., measured in terms of economic costs), the length (in time), and the nature (e.g., violent/non-violent)";&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt;
*Speed of institutional change through an institutional archaeology of temporal changes in the formal property rights structure.&lt;ref name="HoP2017"/&gt;

When credibility is assessed through these proxies, a better sense can be obtained of the current function that institutions fulfil for a group of actors. In result, one is likely better positioned to predict institutional interventions that might rally social support. Depending on the level of credibility, these can be envisioned as positioned on a gradient from condoning or non-intervention to co-opting, facilitating, prohibiting and ordaining.

The CSI Checklist (Credibility Scales and Intervention)&lt;ref name="Ho 2016 pp. 1121–1144" /&gt; was developed for this purpose.

Apart from studying credibility in real-life situations, the particular premises of the theory – endogeneity, dis-equilibrium, and functional adaptation – make it also suitable for simulation in [[agent-based model]]s.

== Emergence of the theory ==
The question of credibility first emerged along with concern about certain institutional interventions failing. In the mid-20th century [[Vilhelm Aubert]] noted that the Housemaid Law in Norway had been implemented but flaunted by all involved actors.&lt;ref name="Aubert"/&gt; The concept of credibility was initially coined as an ''explanandum'' for the success and failure of Western monetary, anti-inflationary policies in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; A concern for the credibility of policy emerged in the latter half of the 20th century in response to frequently observed failures of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[structural adjustment]]s in the developing world associated with the [[Washington Consensus]]. Institutional reform, such as privatization, failed to deliver the predicted economic growth, not because of lacking credible commitment on part of actors but due to the absence of endogenous credibility.&lt;ref name = Grabel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao Rokpelnis 2016 pp. 1206–1223"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zhao | first=Heng | last2=Rokpelnis | first2=Karlis | title=Local perceptions of grassland degradation in China: a socio-anthropological reading of endogenous knowledge and institutional credibility | journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies | publisher=Informa UK | volume=43 | issue=6 | year=2016 | pages=1206–1223 | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03066150.2016.1192609 | doi=10.1080/03066150.2016.1192609 | accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the growth of the Chinese economy despite lack of many institutions considered to be essential for economic growth indicated that institutional arrangements do not necessarily determine economic outcomes, and also at the same time economic development does not automatically lead to [[teleology|teleologically]] predetermined institutional forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/growth-0|title= Autocracy or democracy?|author=L.P. |date= |website= economist.com |publisher= |access-date= 2015-06-18|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/g20/topics/anti-corruption/issues-paper-on-corruption-and-economic-growth.htm|title= Issues paper on corruption and economic growth |author= OECD |date= |website= oecd.org |publisher= |access-date= 2015-06-20|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly striking in the case of [[Real estate in China|real estate sector]] in China.&lt;ref name="Ho 1087–1118"/&gt; In this context, there is a growing body of research suggesting one should focus on the function or quality of institutional performance rather than their form.&lt;ref name="Aron2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=J.|title=Growth and Institutions: A Review of the Evidence|journal=The World Bank Research Observer|volume=15|issue=1|year=2000|pages=99–135|issn=0257-3032|doi=10.1093/wbro/15.1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AgrawalEtAl2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Agrawal | first=Arun | last2=Wollenberg | first2=E. | last3=Persha | first3=L. | title=Governing agriculture-forest landscapes to achieve climate change mitigation | journal=Global Environmental Change | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=29 | year=2014 | issn=0959-3780 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.10.001 | pages=270–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dixon | first=Adam D. | title=Function before form: macro-institutional comparison and the geography of finance | journal=Journal of Economic Geography | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2012-01-19 | issn=1468-2710 | doi=10.1093/jeg/lbr043 | pages=579–600}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Ha-Joon Chang: “a big problem that dogs the current orthodox literature on development is its inability to clearly distinguish between the forms and functions of institutions.”&lt;ref name="Chang2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Chang | title=Institutional change and economic development | publisher=United Nations University Press | publication-place=New York, NY | year=2007 | isbn=978-92-808-1143-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''credibility thesis'' was put forth by Peter Ho in 2014.&lt;ref name=ho2014 /&gt; In a review of the credibility thesis, Delilah Griswold contended that "credibility is a powerful metric by which to understand and evaluate tenure systems. Importantly, understanding the credibility of a given institution requires analysis outside of theory and politics, analysis that is locally and temporally specific and multilayered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://environment.yale.edu/yer/article/when-it-comes-to-the-efficacy-of-property-rights-function-can-be-more-important-than-form|title= With efficacy of property rights, function can be more important than form|last1= Griswold|first1= Delilah|last2= |first2= |date= {{date|2015-07-09}}|website= Yale Environment Review|publisher= |access-date={{date|2015-11-18}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demico Boothe''' is an [[African American|African-American]] bestselling author of several books.

==Biography==
Born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], he spent nearly 13 years in [[List of U.S. federal prisons|federal prison]] and was released in 2003. He wrote his first book, entitled ''Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?'' while incarcerated, and to date has written and published two other books entitled, ''Getting Out &amp; Staying Out: A Black Man's Guide to Success After Prison'' and ''The Top 25 Things Black Folks Do That We Need To Stop!!!''. The latter was published in January 2009 and received much critical acclaim within the [[African-American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullsurfacepublishing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Demico Boothe is a noted expert on many subjects and issues concerning the African-American community, with an emphasis on the U.S. [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]] as it relates to [[Black people|black males]]. On the back of his book ''Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?'', he states that he read and studied over 500 books while he was incarcerated, including the entire [[Webster's dictionary]], [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]], and every alphabetic entry of the 1998 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].

He is slated to release his fourth title with Full Surface Publishing in late 2012.

'''Ecological economics''' (also called '''eco-economics''', '''ecolonomy''' or '''bioeconomics''' of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen]]) is both a [[transdisciplinary]] and an [[interdisciplinary]] field of academic research addressing the interdependence and [[coevolution]] of human [[economy|economies]] and natural [[ecosystem]]s, both intertemporally and spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anastasios Xepapadeas |year=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=ecological+economics&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Ecological economics |work=[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] 2nd Edition |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of [[natural capital]], the field of '''ecological economics''' is differentiated from [[environmental economics]], which is the [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] analysis of the environment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on [[#History and development|History and development]] below). The related field of [[Green economy|green economics]] is, in general, a more politically applied form of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Paehlke|Paehlke R.]] (1995).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

==History and development==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] predicted the [[Steady-state economy #John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|desirability of the ''stationary state'' of an economy]]. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]]. In 1880, [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist [[Sergei Podolinsky]] attempted to theorize a [[labor theory of value]] based on [[embodied energy]]; his work was read and critiqued by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellamy Foster|first1=John|first2=Paul|last2=Burkett|title=Ecological Economics and Classical Marxism: The "Podolinsky Business" Reconsidered|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|date=March 2004|volume=Vol. 17, No. 1|pages=32-60|url=http://johnbellamyfoster.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/07/OandE-2004-Foster-Burkett-32-60.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]]-winning [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). In his book ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. ''New York Times'', p. WK9.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

European predecessors of ecological economics include [[K. William Kapp]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, K. W. (1950) ''The Social Costs of Private Enterprise''. New York: Shocken.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Polanyi]] (1944)&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, K. (1944) ''The Great Transformation''. New York/Toronto: Rinehart &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Romania]]n economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|The Entropy Law and the Economic Process]]'' (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's ''Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''[[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|Steady-State Economics]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973.

Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner,&lt;ref&gt;Røpke, I. (2004) The early history of modern ecological economics. Ecological Economics 50(3-4): 293-314.&lt;/ref&gt; with a meeting held in Sweden (including [[Robert Costanza]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Charles A S Hall|Charles Hall]], Bruce Hannon, [[H.T. Odum]], and David Pimentel).&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory/&gt; Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martinez-Alier]], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/costanza.pdf Early History of Ecological Economics and ISEE]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; 1989 saw the foundation of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] and publication of its journal, ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', by [[Elsevier]]. [[Robert Costanza]] was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists [[C.S. Holling]] and [[H.T. Odum]], biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. In the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition, sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]] and CUNY geography professor [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] explicitly center ecological concerns in [[political economy]].

== Nature and ecology ==

{{Main article|Nature|Ecology}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution]]

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The "sink function" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing "cumulative pollutants".&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in ''Nature'', the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global [[GDP]] was $27 trillion).&lt;ref name=Costanza1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costanza R | year = 1998 | title = The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital1 | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00020-2 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800998000202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the value went to [[nutrient cycling]]. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''. [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Global [[wild fisheries]] are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} The [[aquaculture]] or [[fish farm|farming]] of [[piscivorous]] fish, like [[salmon]], does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon farming]] has major [[Salmon farming issues|negative impacts]] on wild salmon, as well as the [[forage fish]] that need to be caught to feed them.&lt;ref name="Salmon Run"&gt;

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets similar to that of the United States. [[Genetically modified food]] (GMF) a conventional solution to the problem, presents numerous problems &amp;ndash; [[Bt corn]] produces its own [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] toxin/protein, but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|31}} The overall effect of GMF on yields is contentious, with the USDA and FAO acknowledging that GMFs do not necessarily have higher yields and may even have reduced yields.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Association.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
{{See also|Environmental ethics}}{{Renewable energy sources}}

[[Mainstream economics]] has attempted to become a value-free '[[hard and soft science|hard science]]', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of [[utility]], [[efficiency]], and [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefits]] such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/politics_ideology.pdf Politics and Ideology in Ecological Economics]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have goals similar to [[green politics]].

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the ''green economy'' grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=O.|date=2011|title=Promise and shortcomings of a green turn in recent policy responses to the ‘double crisis’|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.36|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=70|pages=2308–2316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/green-economy United Nations Environment Program]'' (UNEP) defines a ‘green economy’ as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‘green’ is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/126GER_synthesis_en.pdf economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive].

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janicke|first=M.|date=2012|title=‘Green growth’: from a growing eco‐industry to economic sustainability|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=28|pages=13-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the [http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf Green Economy] adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. 

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2012.

=== Green politics ===

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the more radical social ecological economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J., 1994. Ecological economics and ecosocialism, in: O'Connor, M. (Ed.), Is Capitalism Sustainable? Guilford Press, New York, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spash, C.L., Clayton, A.M.H., 1997. The maintenance of natural capital: Motivations and methods, in: Light, A., Smith, J.M. (Eds.), Space, Place and Environmental Ethics. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., Lanham, pp. 143-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toman, M., 1998. Why not to calculate the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Ecological Economics 25, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with Nature and the non-human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists [[commodification]] of everything external to the market system.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F., 1993. Ecology, Policy and Politics: Human Well-Being and the Natural World. Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F. (1997) Managing without prices: On the monetary valuation of biodiversity. Ambio 26, 546-550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatn, A., 2000. The environment as commodity. Environmental Values 9, 493-509&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, and modeling.

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]), while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of "standard of living") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as [[uneconomic growth]] (see diagram above).

===Weak versus strong sustainability===

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism #Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

=== Energy economics ===
[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|275px|Exergy analysis can be performed to find connections between economic value and the physical world.

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=
|last2= Cleveland |first2=Cutler J.
|last3=Kaufmann |first3=Robert
|year=1992 |publisher= University Press of colorado |location= Niwot, Colorado |isbn=  |pages=|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922072349/http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html |date=2008-09-22 }}” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - a useful concept |author=Wall, Göran |publisher=Exergy.se |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
{{See also|Net energy gain}}

An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. "Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time," ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===
{{see also|Ecosystem valuation|Price of life}}
Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits&lt;ref&gt; Farley, Joshua. "Ecosystem services: The economics debate." Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Giorgos, Erik Gómez-Baggethun, and Christos Zografos. "To value or not to value? That is not the question." Ecological economics 94 (2013): 97-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Costanza, R. |author2=d'Arge, R. |author3=de Groot, R. |author4=Farber, S. |author5=Grasso, M. |author6=Hannon, B. |author7=Naeem, S. |author8=Limburg, K. |author9=Paruelo, J. |author10=O'Neill, R.V. |author11=Raskin, R. |author12=Sutton, P. |author13=and van den Belt, M. |year=1997 |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.  This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some [[Environmental economics|environmental economists]] - for being inconsistent with assumptions of [[financial capital]] [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norgaard, R.B.  |author2=Bode, C. |year=1998|title= Next, the value of God, and other reactions|journal=Ecological Economics|volume= 25|pages= 37–39|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(98)00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole idea of treating ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial.

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 SocialEdge.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215083840/http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 |date=2009-02-15 }} Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621054850/http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html Multinational Monitor, 9/2007.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics&lt;ref&gt;Spash, Clive L. "The brave new world of carbon trading." New Political Economy 15.2 (2010): 169-195 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621193253/http://www.panna.org/jt/AgAssessment |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.  The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export [[GMO]]s and promote "[[free trade]]" agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/04/17/do1702.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=GM crops can save us from food shortages | first=Bill | last=Emmott | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not 'externalities', but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''"[[externalities]]"'' is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura, Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, David "Blueprint for a Green Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as [[Clive Spash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted?

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]] explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein , Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist [[Clive Spash]] has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–195 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

[[Mathematical model]]ing is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include:&lt;ref&gt;Proops, J., and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/bookentry_main.lasso?id=2951 Modelling in Ecological Economics], Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary]], [[input/output model|input-output]], neo-Austrian modeling, [[entropy]] and [[thermodynamic]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria]], and [[agent-based]] modeling, the environmental [[Kuznets curve]], and [[Stock-Flow consistent model]] frameworks. [[System dynamics]] and [[GIS]] are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling.  A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voinov|first=Alexey|title=Systems science and modeling for ecological economics|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080886175|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying "the common good"&lt;ref&gt;Felber, Christian (2012), "La economia del bien commun" (Duestro)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as [[biodiversity]], and the emergent [[ecosystem services]] is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta P. Nature’s role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5–11.&lt;/ref&gt; While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
 
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley D. Selling out on nature. Nature. 2006;443(September):7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270–8&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
 
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579–82&lt;/ref&gt; Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">'''''El Paquete Semanal''''' ("The Weekly Package") or '''''El Paquete''''' is a one [[terabyte]] collection of digital material distributed since around 2008&lt;ref name="bbc-20150910"/&gt; on the [[underground market]] in [[Cuba]] as a substitute for [[broadband Internet]].&lt;ref name="nacla"/&gt; In 2015 it was the primary source of entertainment for millions of Cubans.&lt;ref name="bbc-20150910"/&gt; Lower tiered packages are also available for a lower price at sizes ranging from 5-100gb. 

The most popular content is TV series, soap operas, music and the illegal classifieds{{clarify|date=January 2016}} but it also contains films, video clips, Spanish language news websites, computer technology websites, instructional videos and advertisements for local Cuban businesses. Most buyers request only certain parts of the Package which may sell for as little as $1 US.&lt;ref name="nacla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-20150810"/&gt;

Since a 2011 legal property reform regarding private enterprise, a Cuban advertising firm called Etres has used the new regulations surrounding advertising to legally charge local businesses a small fee to arrange for a short clip or poster promoting their establishment to feature in the Package.&lt;ref name="bbc-20150810"/&gt;

In May 2016 it was still unknown who compiled the material or from where it was obtained.&lt;ref name="sr-20160522"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nacla"/&gt; Some have theorized that the lack of pornographic material and lack of anti-government views in the package may indicate the Cuban government is involved in its production.&lt;ref name="cbc-20150125"/&gt;

'''Electroreception''' or '''electroception''' is the biological ability to perceive natural [[electrical]] stimuli.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electroreception|date=2005|publisher=Springer|others=Bullock, Theodore Holmes.|isbn=978-0387231921|location=New York|oclc=77005918}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed almost exclusively in aquatic or amphibious animals, because water is a much better [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] than air. The known exceptions are the [[monotremes]]
([[echidnas]] and [[platypus]]es), [[cockroaches]] and [[bees]]. Electroreception is used in electrolocation (detecting objects) and for [[electrocommunication]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Active electro.png|thumb|right|Active electrolocation. Conductive objects concentrate the field and resistive objects spread the field.]]
[[File:Scene analysis in electroreception.jpg|thumb|For the [[Mormyridae|elephantfish]] (here ''[[Gnathonemus]]'') the electric field emanates from an electric organ in the tail region (gray rectangle). It is sensed by the electroreceptive skin areas, using two electric pits (foveas) to actively search and inspect objects.

Until recently, electroreception was known only in [[vertebrate]]s.

==Electrolocation==
Electroreceptive animals use this sense to locate objects around them. This is important in [[ecological niche]]s where the animal cannot depend on vision: for example in caves, in murky water and at night. Many fish use electric fields to detect buried prey. Some shark embryos and pups "freeze" when they detect the characteristic electric signal of their predators.&lt;ref name=Coplin2004&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Coplin, S. P. |author2=Whitehead, D. | title = The functional roles of passive electroreception in non-electric fishes | journal = Animal Biology | year = 2004 | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–25 | doi = 10.1163/157075604323010024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that sharks can use their acute electric sense to detect the earth's magnetic field by detecting the weak electric currents induced by their swimming or by the flow of ocean currents.  The walking behaviour of cockroaches can be affected by the presence of a static electric field: they like to avoid the electric field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Jackson, C. W. |author2=Hunt, E. |author3=Sharkh, S. |author4=Newland, P.

===Active electrolocation===
In active electrolocation,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Albert, J. S. |author2=Crampton, W. G. | year = 2006 | chapter = Electroreception and Electrogenesis | pages = 429–470 | editor = Lutz, P. L. | title = The Physiology of Fishes | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 9780849320224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the animal senses its surrounding environment by generating [[electric fields]] and detecting distortions in these fields using electroreceptor organs.  This electric field is generated by means of a specialised [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ]] consisting of modified muscle or nerves. This field may be modulated so that its frequency and wave form are unique to the species and sometimes, the individual (see [[Jamming avoidance response]]). Animals that use active electroreception include the [[weakly electric fish]], which either generate small electrical pulses (termed "pulse-type") or produce a quasi-sinusoidal discharge from the electric organ (termed "wave-type").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Babineau, D. |author2=Longtin, A. |author3=Lewis, J. E. | title = Modeling the Electric Field of Weakly Electric Fish | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 2006 | volume = 209 | issue = Pt 18 | pages = 3636–3651 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.02403 | pmid = 16943504 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/18/3636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fish create a potential which is usually smaller than one volt. Weakly electric fish can discriminate between objects with different [[resistance (physics)|resistance]] and [[capacitance]] values, which may help in identifying the object. Active electroreception typically has a range of about one body length, though objects with an [[electrical impedance]] similar to that of the surrounding water are nearly undetectable.

===Passive electrolocation===
{{see also|Passive electrolocation in fish}}

In passive electrolocation, the animal senses the weak [[bioelectromagnetism|bioelectric fields]] generated by other animals and uses it to locate them. These electric fields are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles. A second source of electric fields in fish is the ion pumps associated with [[osmoregulation]] at the gill membrane. This field is modulated by the opening and closing of the mouth and gill slits.&lt;ref name=Coplin2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bodznick, D. |author2=Montgomery, J. C. |author3=Bradley, D. J. | title = Suppression of Common Mode Signals Within the Electrosensory System of the Little Skate ''Raja erinacea'' | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 1992 | volume = 171 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 107–125 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/171/1/107.full.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fish that prey on [[electric fish|electrogenic fish]] use the discharges of their prey to detect them. This has driven the prey to evolve more complex or higher frequency signals that are harder to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stoddard, P. K. | title = The evolutionary origins of electric signal complexity | journal = Journal of Physiology - Paris | year = 2002 | volume = 96 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 485–491 | doi = 10.1016/S0928-4257(03)00004-4 | pmid = 14692496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive electroreception is carried out solely by ampullary electroreceptors in fish. It is tuned to low frequency signals (below one up to tens of Hertz).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Fish use passive electroreception to supplement or replace their other senses when detecting prey and predators. In sharks, sensing an electric dipole alone is sufficient to cause them to try to eat it.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Electrocommunication==

Weakly electric fish can also communicate by modulating the electrical [[waveform]] they generate, an ability known as electrocommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hopkins, C. D. | title = Design features for electric communication | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 1999 | volume = 202 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 1217–1228 | pmid = 10210663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They may use this for mate attraction and territorial displays. Some species of catfish use their electric discharges only in [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] displays.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}

In one species of ''[[Brachyhypopomus]]'' (a genus of South American river fish belonging to the family [[Hypopomidae]], commonly known as ''bluntnose knifefishes''), the electric discharge pattern is similar to the low voltage electrolocative discharge of the [[electric eel]]. This is hypothesised to be a form of [[Batesian mimicry]] of the powerfully-protected electric eel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | author = Stoddard, P. K. | title = Predation enhances complexity in the evolution of electric fish signals | journal = Nature | year = 1999 | volume = 400 | issue = 6741 | pages = 254–256 | doi = 10.1038/22301 | pmid = 10421365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensory mechanism==
Active electroreception relies upon tuberous electroreceptors which are sensitive to high frequency (20-20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz) stimuli. These receptors have a loose plug of [[epithelial]] cells which [[Capacitance|capacitively]] couples the sensory receptor cells to the external environment. Passive electroreception however, relies upon [[ampulla]]ry receptors which are sensitive to low frequency stimuli (below 50&amp;nbsp;Hz). These receptors have a jelly-filled canal leading from the sensory receptors to the skin surface. [[Mormyridae|Mormyrid]] electric fish from Africa use tuberous receptors known as [[Knollenorgans]] to sense electric communication signals.

==Examples==

=== Sharks and rays ===
Sharks and rays (members of the subclass ''[[Elasmobranchii]]''), such as the [[lemon shark]], rely heavily on electrolocation in the final stages of their attacks, as can be demonstrated by the robust feeding response elicited by electric fields similar to those of their prey.&lt;ref name="shark sense"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=R. Douglas|title=The Shark's Electric Sense|journal=Scientific American|date=August 2007|url=http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/the%20ocean%20project/shark's%20electric%20sense.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharks are the most electrically sensitive animals known, responding to [[Direct current|DC]] fields as low as 5 nV/cm.

The electric field sensors of sharks are called the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]]. They consist of electroreceptor cells connected to the seawater by pores on their snouts and other zones of the head. A problem with the early [[submarine telegraph cable]]s was the damage caused by sharks who sensed the electric fields produced by these cables. It is possible that sharks may use Earth's [[magnetic field]] to navigate the oceans using this sense.

=== Bony fish ===
The [[electric eel]] (actually a [[Gymnotidae|knifefish]], not an [[eel]]), besides its ability to generate high voltage electric shocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Catania |first1=Kenneth C. |title=Electric Eels Concentrate Their Electric Field to Induce Involuntary Fatigue in Struggling Prey |journal=Current Biology |date=October 2015 |volume=25 |issue=22 |pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.036 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2901147-1# |pmid=26521183}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses lower voltage pulses for navigation and prey detection in its turbid habitat.&lt;ref name=Fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Electrophorus|species=electricus|year=2005|month=December}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability is shared with other [[gymnotiformes]].

=== Monotremes ===
[[File:Platypus.jpg|left|thumb|The [[platypus]] is a [[monotreme]] mammal that uses electroreception.]]

The monotremes are the only group of land mammals known to have evolved electroreception.  While the electroreceptors in fish and amphibians evolved from mechanosensory lateral line organs, those of monotremes are based on cutaneous glands innervated by trigeminal nerves.  The electroreceptors of monotremes consist of free nerve endings located in the mucous glands of the snout. Among the monotremes, the [[platypus]] (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'') has the most acute electric sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scheich, H. |author2=Langner, G. |author3=Tidemann, C. |author4=Coles, R. B. |author5=Guppy, A. | title = Electroreception and electrolocation in platypus | journal = Nature | year = 1986 | volume = 319 | issue = 6052 | pages = 401–402 | pmid = 3945317 | doi = 10.1038/319401a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pettigrew, J. D. | title = Electroreception in Monotremes | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | year = 1999 | volume = 202 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 1447–1454 | pmid = 10210685 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/10/1447.full.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The platypus has almost 40,000 electroreceptors arranged in a series of stripes along the bill, which probably aids the localisation of prey.&lt;ref name="Map Of Life"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_41_Electroreception-in-fish-amphibians-and-monotremes/|title=Electroreception in fish, amphibians and monotremes |publisher=Map Of Life |year=2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platypus electroreceptive system is highly directional, with the axis of greatest sensitivity pointing outwards and downwards. By making short-latency head movements called "[[saccades]]" when swimming, platypuses constantly expose the most sensitive part of their bill to the stimulus to localise prey as accurately as possible.  The platypus appears to use electroreception along with [[mechanoreception|pressure sensors]] to determine the distance to prey from the delay between the arrival of electrical signals and pressure changes in the water.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1999" /&gt;

The electroreceptive capabilities of the two species of [[echidna]] (which are terrestrial) are much more simple. [[Long-beaked echidna]]s (genus ''Zaglossus'') possess only 2,000 receptors and [[short-beaked echidna]]s (''Tachyglossus aculeatus'') have merely 400 concentrated in the tip of the snout.&lt;ref name="Map Of Life" /&gt; This difference can be attributed to their habitat and feeding methods.  Western long-beaked echidnas live in wet tropical forests where they feed on earthworms in damp leaf litter, so their habitat is probably favourable to the reception of electrical signals.  Contrary to this is the varied but generally more arid habitat of their short-beaked relative which feeds primarily on termites and ants in nests; the humidity in these nests presumably allows electroreception to be used in hunting for buried prey, particularly after rains.&lt;ref name=Proske1998&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Proske, U. |author2=Gregory, J. E. |author3=Iggo, A. | title = Sensory receptors in monotremes | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | year = 1998 | volume = 353 | issue = 1372 | pages = 1187–1198 | pmc = 1692308 | pmid = 9720114 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1998.0275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments have shown that echidnas can be trained to respond to weak electric fields in water and moist soil.  The electric sense of the echidna is hypothesised to be an evolutionary remnant from a platypus-like ancestor.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1999"/&gt;

=== Dolphins ===
Dolphins have evolved electroreception in structures different from those of fish, amphibians and monotremes. The hairless [[whiskers|vibrissal]] crypts on the [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] of the [[Sotalia (genus)|Guiana dolphin]] (''Sotalia guianensis''), originally associated with mammalian whiskers, are capable of electroreception as low as 4.8 μV/cm, sufficient to detect small fish. This is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in the platypus.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Czech-Damal, N. U. |author2=Liebschner, A. |author3=Miersch, L. |author4=Klauer, G. |author5=Hanke, F.

===Bees===
Bees collect a [[Atmospheric electricity|positive static charge while flying]] through the air. When a bee visits a flower, the charge deposited on the flower takes a while to leak away into the ground. Bees can detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, and use this information to know if a flower has been recently visited by another bee and is therefore likely to have a reduced concentration of [[nectar]].&lt;ref name=Clarke2013/&gt;
Animals detect electric fields through insulating air by mechano-reception, not electroreception. Bees sense the electric field changes via the [[Johnston's organ]]s in their [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and possibly other mechano-receptors. They distinguish different temporal patterns and learn them. During the [[waggle dance]], [[honeybee]]s appear to use the electric field emanating from the dancing bee for distance communication.&lt;ref name=Greggers&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greggers, U. |author2=Koch, G. |author3=Schmidt, V. |author4=Dürr, A. |author5=Floriou-Servou, A. |author6=Piepenbrock, D. |author7=Göpfert, M.

It has been claimed that the electromagnetic fields generated by pylons and masts have adverse effects on wildlife; a list of 153 references to this has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/63829925/Is-Electrosmog-hurting-our-wildlife-149-references|title=Is electrosmog harming our wildlife?|publisher=EMFsafety|year=2012|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmentalism''' or '''environmental rights''' is a broad [[Philosophy of life|philosophy]], [[ideology]], and [[social movement]] regarding concerns for [[environmental protection]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the impact of changes to the environment on humans, animals, plants and non-living matter. While environmentalism focuses more on the environmental and nature-related aspects of [[Green politics|green ideology and politics]], [[ecologism]] combines the ideology of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and environmentalism. Ecologism is more commonly used in continental European languages while ‘environmentalism’ is more commonly used in English but the words have slightly different connotations.

Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and/or improvement of the natural environment, and may be referred to as a movement to control [[pollution]] or protect plant and animal diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environmentalism |title=Environmentalism - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, concepts such as a [[land ethic]], [[environmental ethics]], [[biodiversity]], [[ecology]], and the [[biophilia hypothesis]] figure predominantly.

At its crux, environmentalism is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend in such a way that all the components are accorded a proper degree of [[sustainability]]. The exact measures and outcomes of this balance is controversial and there are many different ways for environmental concerns to be expressed in practice. Environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the color [[Green#In culture|green]],&lt;ref name="Light, Dark and Bright Green Environmentalism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greendaily.com/2009/04/23/light-dark-and-bright-green-environmentalism/ |title=Light, Dark and Bright Green Environmentalism |accessdate=2009-11-02 |author=Cat Lincoln |date=Spring 2009 |publisher=Green Daily |archivedate=25 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425173005/http://www.greendaily.com/2009/04/23/light-dark-and-bright-green-environmentalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this association has been appropriated by the marketing industries for the tactic known as [[greenwashing]].

Environmentalism is opposed by [[anti-environmentalism]], which says that the Earth is less fragile than some environmentalists maintain, and portrays environmentalism as overreacting to the human contribution to [[climate change]] or opposing human advancement.&lt;ref name=rowell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowell|first=Andrew|title=Green Backlash|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415128285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''Environmentalism'' denotes a [[environmental movement|social movement]] that seeks to influence the political process by lobbying, activism, and education in order to protect natural resources and [[ecosystem]]s.

An ''[[environmentalist]]'' is a person who may speak out about our natural environment and the sustainable management of its resources through changes in public policy or individual behavior. This may include supporting practices such as informed consumption, conservation initiatives, investment in [[renewable resources]], improved efficiencies in the materials economy, transitioning to new accounting paradigms such as [[Ecological economics]], renewing and revitalizing our connections with non-human life or even opting to have one less child to reduce consumption and pressure on resources.

In various ways (for example, grassroots activism and protests), environmentalists and [[environmental organization]]s seek to give the natural world a stronger voice in human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gottlieb, ''Forcing the Spring: The Transformation of the American Environmental Movement'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, environmentalists advocate the [[sustainability|sustainable]] management of resources, and the protection (and restoration, when necessary) of the [[natural environment]] through changes in public policy and individual behavior. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in ecosystems, the movement is centered around [[ecology]], [[health]], and [[human rights]].

==History==
{{See also|Conservation movement|Timeline of history of environmentalism}}
[[File:Mahaveer swami.jpg|thumb|150px|Lord [[Mahavira]], the last [[Jain]] Tirthankar is also considered to be a great environmentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/mumbai/Mahavir-Jayanti-2016-He-was-a-great-environmentalist-Fadnavis-says/articleshow/51903910.cms|title=Lord Mahavir was a great environmentalist: Fadnavis - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A concern for environmental protection has recurred in diverse forms, in different parts of the world, throughout history. 
The earliest ideas of environment protectionism can be traced in [[Jainism]], which was revived by [[Mahavira]] in 6th century BC in ancient [[India]]. Jainism offers a view that may seem readily compatible with core values associated with environmental activism, i.e., protection of life by [[nonviolence]]; which could form the basis of strong ecological ethos thus adding its voice to global calls for protection of environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;dq=jainism+and+environmentalism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX9Y7Xva_dAhXFrY8KHYaHAMgQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism+and+environmentalism&amp;f=false|title=Jainism: An Introduction|first=Jeffery D.|last=Long|date=22 March 2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/publications/books/cswr/jainism-introduction/|title=Jainism Introduction - Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series - Books - Publications - Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|website=fore.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] of England banned the burning of [[coal|sea-coal]] by proclamation in [[London]] in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem.&lt;ref name="Pea-souper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/perspect/london.htm |title=London's Historic 'Pea-Soupers' |accessdate=2006-08-02 |author=David Urbinato |date=Summer 1994 |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002080012/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/perspect/london.htm |archivedate=2 October 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadly"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/science/smog.html |title=Deadly Smog |accessdate=2006-08-02 |date=2003-01-17 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.

Earlier in the [[Middle East]], the [[Caliph]] [[Abu Bakr]] in the 630s commanded his army to "Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire," and "Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food."&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{citation |last1=Aboul-Enein |first1=H.

===Early environmental legislation===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the [[Industrial Revolution]], sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
{{quote|
At the advent of steam and electricity the muse of history holds her nose and shuts her eyes ([[H. G. Wells]] 1918).&lt;ref&gt;[[In the Fourth Year|In the Fourth Year: Anticipations of a World Peace]], (London: Chatto &amp; Windus), p 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the [[atmosphere]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=2006-02-14 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.

During the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], anarchist controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms which were possibly the largest in the world at the time. [[Daniel Guérin|Daniel Guerin]] notes that [[List of anarchist communities|anarchist territories]] would diversify crops, extend [[irrigation]], initiate [[reforestation]], start tree nurseries and helped establish [[nudist]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|last=Guerin|first=Daniel|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] shut down several metal factories.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McKay, “Objectivity and Right-Libertarian Scholarship,” 20 January 2009, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/caplan.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, only under the impetus of the [[Great Smog]] of 1952 in London, which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths that the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] was passed and airborne pollution in the city was first tackled. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism, and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people's quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://activehistory.ca/2012/12/londons-great-smog-60-years-on/|title=London’s Great Smog, 60 Years On|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 19th century also saw the passage of the first wildlife conservation laws.
The zoologist [[Alfred Newton]] published a series of investigations into the ''Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals'' between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] and influenced the passage of the [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act]] in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G.

===First environmental movements===
Early interest in the environment was a feature of the [[Romantic movement]] in the early 19th century. The poet [[William Wordsworth]] travelled extensively in the [[Lake District]] and wrote that it is a "sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eh-resources.org/timeline/timeline_conservation.html |title=Nature conservation in Britain, ca. 1870-1945 |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122133729/http://www.eh-resources.org/timeline/timeline_conservation.html |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Ruskin - Portrait - Project Gutenberg eText 17774.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]] an influential thinker who articulated the Romantic ideal of environmental protection and conservation.]]
Systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to [[industrialization]], the growth of cities, and worsening air and [[water pollution]]. Starting with the formation of the [[Commons Preservation Society]] in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Robert Hunter]], solicitor for the society, worked with [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], [[Octavia Hill]], and [[John Ruskin]] to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of [[Newlands Valley|Newlands]] and [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).&lt;ref name=vc&gt;[http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm "Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806070246/http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm |date=6 August 2014 }}, Visitcumbria.com, accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote about ecology in [[economics]], [[agricultural science]], [[Conservation movement|conservation]], [[ethology]], criminology, urban planning, geography, geology and biology. He observed in Swiss and Siberian glaciers that they had been slowly melting since the dawn of the industrial revolution, possibly making him one of the first predictors for climate change. He also observed the damage done from deforestation and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zabalazabooks.net/2013/12/04/green-flame-kropotkin-and-the-birth-of-ecology/|title=Green Flame: Kropotkin and the Birth of Ecology|last=Purchase|first=Graham|date=4 December 2013|website=zabalazabooks.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin's writings would become influential in the 1970s and became a major inspiration for the [[intentional community]] movement as well as his ideas becoming the basis for the theory of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the "National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty" was formally inaugurated in 1894.&lt;ref name=t94&gt;"A Proposed National Trust", ''The Times'', 17 July 1894, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"Parliamentary Committees", ''The Times'', 26 July 1907. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was passed in August 1907.&lt;ref name=act&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf "An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602185018/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf |date=2 June 2012 }}, The National Trust, accessed 4 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An early "Back-to-Nature" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Edward Carpenter]], who were all against [[consumerism]], [[pollution]] and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Peter C. (1988). ''Early Green Politics'', Brighton, Harvester Press, pgs. 15-19, and [[Derek Wall|Wall, Derek]], (1994) ''Green History: A Reader.'' London, Routledge, pgs. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical [[Utopia]] and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a ''small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Back_to_the_Land.html?id=JcvZAAAAMAAJ|title=Back to the Land: The Pastoral Impulse in England, 1880-1914|author=Jan Marsh|year=1982|publisher=Quartet Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the "taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality", were enthusiastically revived, including the [[Morris dance]] and the [[maypole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1215/121523.html|title='Back to nature' movement nothing new - dates back to 1880|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas also inspired various environmental groups in the UK, such as the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], established in 1889 by [[Emily Williamson]] as a [[advocacy group|protest group]] to campaign for greater protection for the indigenous birds of the [[British Isles|island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp|title=Milestones|publisher=''RSPB''|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=''RSPB''|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the [[ornithologist]] Professor [[Alfred Newton]]. By 1900, public support for the organisation had grown, and it had over 25,000 members. The [[Garden city movement]] incorporated many environmental concerns into its [[urban planning]] manifesto; the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and [[The Clarion]] movement also began to advocate measures of [[nature conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould,(1988) pgs. 16, 23-4,36-8,84-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|left|Original title page of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]].]]
[[Environmental movement in the United States|The movement in the United States]] began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as [[John Muir]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.

In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916 the [[National Park Service]] was founded by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]].

The [[Forestry Commission]] was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for [[afforestation]] and [[reforestation]]. The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade.&lt;ref name=woodland&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forestry Commission – a brief history|publisher=Woodland Trust|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/campaigning/save-ancient-forests/Documents/a-brief-history-of-the-fc.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. By 1939 the Forestry Commission was the largest landowner in Britain.&lt;ref name=ForestPoliciesBook&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Policies and Social Change in England|author=Sylvie Nail|date=July 2008|page=332|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402083648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the ''Dauerwald'' (best translated as the "perpetual forest") which included concepts such as [[forest management]] and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/technology_and_culture/v048/48.1olsen.html JONATHAN OLSEN "How Green Were the Nazis?

In 1949, ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' by [[Aldo Leopold]] was published. It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.

Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organizations. [[David Brower]], [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Nancy Newhall]] created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. "This Is Dinosaur" edited by [[Wallace Stegner]] with photographs by [[Martin Litton (environmentalist)|Martin Litton]] and [[Philip Hyde (photographer)|Philip Hyde]] prevented the building of dams within [[Dinosaur National Monument]] by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of [[Yosemite National Park]], when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanized public opposition to building dams in the [[Grand Canyon]] and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] and many others. After a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the exploitation of natural resources.

===Post-war expansion===

In 1962, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of [[DDT]] in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds.&lt;ref name="Silent Spring"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Silent Spring]] |first=Rachel |last=Carson |authorlink=Rachel Carson |year=1962 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=[[Boston]] |isbn=0-8093-2218-8}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting public concern led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth (US)]], as well as notable local organizations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]], which was founded in 1967.

In the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/opinion/in-praise-of-the-counterculture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the [[United Tasmania Group]] [[Tasmania|Tasmania, Australia]] and the [[Values Party]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Dann, Christine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dann|first=Christine|title=The development of the first two Green parties New Zealand and Tasmania|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515170932/http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 May 2011|work=From Earth's last islands.

The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the [[Ecology Party]], and then the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].

Protection of the environment also became important in the [[developing world]]; the [[Chipko movement]] was formed in India under the influence of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] and they set up peaceful resistance to [[deforestation]] by literally hugging trees (leading to the term "tree huggers"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan "ecology is permanent economy" were very influential.

Another milestone in the movement was the creation of [[Earth Day]]. Earth Day was first observed in [[San Francisco]] and other cities on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On March 21, 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a [[spaceship Earth]] on Earth Day, hereby referring to the [[ecosystem services]] the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the [[Earth Day Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Resource temporarily unavailable |publisher=Earthday.net |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is celebrated in more than 175 countries every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/earthday.htm |title=What Is Earth Day? |publisher=Chemistry.about.com |date=2012-04-15 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on June 5–16, 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.&lt;ref name="Baylis3"&gt;John Baylis, Steve Smith. 2005. The Globalization of World Politics (3rd ed). Oxford. Oxford University Press. P.454-455&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The [[Back-to-the-land movement]] started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with [[anti-Vietnam War]] sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as [[deep ecology]]. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973 and the formation of [[CITES]] in 1975. Significant amendments were also enacted to the United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, {{usstat|84|1676}}, {{uspl|91|604}}, 1970-12-31.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&amp;documentId=70515&amp;glinID=70515 Pub.L. 95-217] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205148/http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&amp;documentId=70515&amp;glinID=70515 |date=29 February 2012 }}, December 27, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[James Lovelock]], a British scientist, published ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth'', which put forth the [[Gaia hypothesis]]; it proposes that life on [[earth]] can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the [[Deep Green Resistance|Deep Green]] ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists.

===21st century and beyond===
Environmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as [[global warming]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and [[genetic engineering]].

Research demonstrates a precipitous decline in the US public's interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McCallum, M.L.|author2=G.W. Bury|last-author-amp=yes|year=2013|title=Google search patterns suggest declining interest in the environment|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|doi=10.1007/s10531-013-0476-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-013-0476-6|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1355–1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans are less likely be actively participating in an environmental movement or organization and more likely to identify as "unsympathetic" to an environmental movement than in 2000.&lt;ref name="gallup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx |title=Environment &amp;#124; Gallup Historical Trends |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely a lingering factor of the [[Great Recession]] in 2008. Since 2005, the percentage of Americans agreeing that the environment should be given priority over economic growth has dropped 10 points, in contrast, those feeling that growth should be given priority "even if the environment suffers to some extent" has risen 12 percent.&lt;ref name="gallup.com"/&gt; These numbers point to the growing complexity of environmentalism and its relationship to economics.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== New forms of ecoactivism ===
[[Tree sitting]] is a form of activism in which the protester sits in a tree in an attempt to stop the removal of a tree or to impede the demolition of an area with the longest and most famous tree-sitter being [[Julia Butterfly Hill]], who spent 738 days in a California Redwood, saving a three-acre tract of forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/weekinreview/18basic.html|title=Rising Above the Environmental Debate|last=Fountain|first=Henry|date=18 June 2006|work=New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sit-in]] is a form of activism where one or any number of people occupy a place as a form of protest.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The tactic can be used to encourage social change, such as the Greensboro sit-ins, a series of protests in 1960 to stop racial segregation, but can also be used in ecoactivism, as in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] Protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/veterans-to-serve-as-human-shields-for-pipeline-protesters.html?_r=0|title=New York Times|last=Mele|first=Christopher|date=2016|work=Veterans To Serve as 'Human Shields' for Dakota Pipeline Protestors|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Rojava]] had been ecologically damaged by [[monoculture]], oil extraction, damming of rivers, [[deforestation]], [[drought]], [[Erosion|topsoil loss]] and general pollution. The [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|DFNS]] launched a campaign titled 'Make Rojava Green Again' (a parody of [[Make America Great Again]]) which is attempting to provide [[renewable energy]] to communities (especially [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|solar energy]]), [[reforestation]], protecting water sources, planting gardens, promoting [[urban agriculture]], creating [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserves]], [[Reclaimed water|water recycling]], [[beekeeping]], expanding [[Public Transportation|public transportation]] and promoting environmental awareness within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/building-autonomy-ecology-rojava/|title=Building Autonomy Through Ecology in Rojava|last=|first=|date=28 February 2018|website=unicornriot.ninja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]] are firmly environmentalist and have stopped the extraction of oil, uranium, timber and metal from the [[Lacandon Jungle]] and stopped the use of [[pesticide]]s and [[Fertilizer|chemical fertilizers]] in farming.&lt;ref&gt;Gobierno Autónomo I: Cuaderno de texto de primer grado del curso de “La Libertad según l@s Zapatistas”'', 19.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CIPO-RFM]] has engaged in [[sabotage]] and [[direct action]] against [[wind farm]]s, [[shrimp farms]], [[Eucalyptus|eucalyptus plantations]] and the [[timber industry]]. They have also set up corn and coffee [[worker cooperative]]s and built schools and hospitals to help the local populations. They have also created a network of autonomous community radio stations to educate people about dangers to the environment and inform the surrounding communities about new industrial projects that would destroy more land. In 2001, the CIPO-RFM defeated the construction of a highway that was part of [[Plan Puebla Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Rebellion: Stories from the Grassroots Mobilisation in Oaxaca|last=Denham|first=Diana|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[environmental movement]]'' (a term that sometimes includes the [[conservation movement|conservation]] and [[Green politics|green]] movements) is a diverse scientific, [[Social movement|social]], and [[political movement]].

&lt;/ref&gt; the environmental movement has a younger demographic than is common in other social movements (see [[green seniors]]).

Environmentalism as a movement covers broad areas of institutional oppression, including for example: consumption of ecosystems and natural resources into waste, dumping waste into disadvantaged communities, air pollution, water pollution, weak infrastructure, exposure of organic life to toxins, mono-culture, anti-polythene drive (jhola movement) and various other focuses. Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: [[environmental science]], environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and [[environmental justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/enviro-j/|title=American Environmental Justice Movement - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free market environmentalism===
{{Main|Free-market environmentalism}}

Free market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the [[free market]], [[property rights]], and [[tort]] law provide the best tools to preserve the health and [[sustainability]] of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and [[class action]].

===Evangelical environmentalism===
{{Main|Evangelical environmentalism}}

Evangelical environmentalism is an environmental movement in the United States of America in which some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] have emphasized [[Bible|biblical]] mandates concerning humanity's role as steward and subsequent responsibility for the caretaking of Creation. While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded [[theology|theological]] perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion.

===Preservation and conservation===
{{Main|Conservation movement|Conservation in the United States}}

Environmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Organizations and conferences==
{{Main|List of environmental organizations}}
[[File:ReefDoctor work station in Ifaty, Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Reef doctor work station in [[Tsifota|Ifaty]], [[Madagascar]]]]

Environmental organizations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private ([[NGO]]). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.

Some US environmental organizations, among them the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], specialize in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[the Nature Conservancy]], and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and global groups like the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], disseminate information, participate in [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]], [[Lobbying|lobby]], [[Demonstration (people)|stage demonstrations]], and may purchase land for [[Nature reserve|preservation]]. Statewide nonprofit organizations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]] often collaborate with these national organizations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including [[Wildlife Conservation International]], conduct research on [[endangered species]] and [[ecosystems]]. More radical organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Earth First!]], and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground ''Earth Liberation Front'' engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.

On an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed [[UNEP]] ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]) and the follow-up [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in 1992. Other international organizations in support of environmental policies development include the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (as part of [[NAFTA]]), the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).

==In popular culture==
* The popular media have been used to convey conservation messages in the U.S. For instance, the U.S. Forest Service created [[Smokey the Bear]] in 1944; he appeared in countless posters, radio and television programs, movies, press releases, and other guises to warn about forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Earnhardt Morrison, ''Guardian of the Forest: A History of Smokey Bear and the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Program'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strip ''[[Mark Trail]]'', by environmentalist [[Ed Dodd]], began in 1946; it still appears weekly in 175 newspapers. Another example is the children's animated show ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]'', created by [[Ted Turner]] and [[Barbara Pyle]] in 1989 to inform children about environmental issues. The show aired for six seasons and 113 episodes, in 100 countries worldwide from 1990 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarapyle.com/captain/|title=Barbara Pyle, with Ted Turner created the animated action series Captain Planet and the Planeteers.|author=|date=|website=www.barbarapyle.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1974, [[Spokane]], [[State of Washington]], became the smallest city ever to host a [[World's Fair]]. From Saturday, May 4, to Sunday, November 3, 1974, Spokane hosted [[Expo 74]], the first world's fair to focus on the environment. The theme of Expo 74 was "Celebrating Tomorrow's Fresh New Environment."
* [[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]] is an animated motion picture released in 1992, which focuses exclusively on the environment. The movie is based on a book under the same title by Diana Young. In 1998, a sequel, [[FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue]], was introduced.
* [[Miss Earth]] is one of the three largest international beauty pageants. (The other two are [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss World]].) Of these three, Miss Earth is the only beauty pageant that promotes Environmental Awareness. The reigning titleholders dedicate their year to promote specific projects and often address issues concerning the environment and other global issues through school tours, tree planting activities, street campaigns, coastal clean ups, speaking engagements, shopping mall tours, media guesting, environmental fair, storytelling programs, eco-fashion shows, and other environmental activities. The Miss Earth winner is the spokesperson for the [[Miss Earth Foundation]], the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and other environmental organizations. The Miss Earth Foundation also works with the environmental departments and ministries of participating countries, various private sectors and corporations, as well as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wildlife Foundation]] (WWF).
* Another area of environmentalism is to use [[art]] to raise awareness about misuse of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Washed Up' Art Exhibition Raises Awareness of Plastic Pollution|url=https://www.wilson.edu/washed-art-exhibition-raises-awareness-plastic-pollution-0|publisher=Wilson College|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unmasking Pollution with Climate Art|url=http://newsroom.unfccc.int/climate-action/art4climate-unmasking-pollution-with-climate-art/|website=UN Climate Change: Climate Action|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerini|first1=Marianna|title=How limited edition sneakers designed by Kanye West are helping people breathe in China|url=http://www.cnn.com/style/article/sneaker-pollution-mask-designer/index.html|accessdate=2 October 2017|agency=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is [[trashion]], using trash to create clothes, jewelry, and other objects for the home. [[Marina DeBris]] is one trashion artist, who focuses on ocean and beach trash to design clothes and for fund raising, education.

==An alternative view==

Many environmentalists believe that human interference with 'nature' should be restricted or minimised as a matter of urgency (for the sake of life, or the planet, or just for the benefit of the human species),&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[environmental skeptics]] and anti-environmentalists do not believe that there is such a need.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?." New Global Studies 7.3: 23-56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} One can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human 'interference' with 'nature' should be ''increased''.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Paul Cummins "An Evolutionary Perspective on the Relationship Between Humans and Their Surroundings: Geoengineering, the Purpose of Life &amp; the Nature of the Universe", Cranmore Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature, leading to less concern with environment preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.scribd.com/doc/119009229/Environment-Professional-and-the-Touch-with-Nature |title=Vasconcelos, Vitor Vieira "The Environment Professional and the Touch with Nature."

'''''Funky Bones''''' is a public artwork by [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist collective led by [[Joep van Lieshout]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], which is on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The artwork, primarily made from [[fiberglass]], consists of twenty white and black [[bone]]-shaped benches.

==Description==
''Funky Bones'' is situated in the Meadow region just south of the lake at 100 Acres.  It is a site-specific artwork consisting of twenty white bone-shaped benches inscribed with black drawings of bones that together form a large stylized human [[skeleton]]. The artwork was constructed primarily from fiberglass, [[plywood]], and [[concrete]]. Each bench is a fiberglass shell filled with a lightweight foam material. The fiberglass surface has been impregnated with pigment, carved, and coated in polyester resin. Plywood was used only during the detailing process of the black bone segments and is not visible in the completed artwork. The concrete component for this artwork is not visible but rather serves as a structural aid, anchoring and securing the individual benches into the ground. A standard [[ready-mix concrete]] was used for this application.

The skeleton is positioned with its arms spread out horizontally while the legs point straight down.  The individual benches range in both length and width, but all are approximately 26'' in height.  The artwork was fabricated in Atelier Van Lieshout's studio in [[Rotterdam]] and shipped to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it was installed by the design and installation crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/100acres/artists/ateliervanlieshout|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
''Funky Bones'' was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in May 2010 and is currently on temporary loan.&lt;ref name="Sheets"/&gt; The artwork arose from many disparate interests of Joep van Lieshout, the founder and head designer of AVL. These include [[human anatomy]] &lt;ref name="Schengen"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Acres Sculpture Park in Indianapolis|publisher=Schengen Visas Organization|url=http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185139/http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of the site. Concerning the original concept and inspiration behind ''Funky Bones'', Joep van Lieshout stated:

{{quote|I came up with [this] design that is not only a site specific artwork referring to the history of the continent, but also provides a function and will improve the stay of the park's visitors.  Even as a child I knew the state Indiana and Indianapolis as an exotic place where the 'Indians' came from and were living, and even though this is not true, it is important for my proposition.  Another field of interest is the history of art and especially in early developments of art from primitive and native cultures.  In early art forms, techniques and skills were not so developed and the artworks were made in a very basic way, therefore art had a direct relation to the people, its time and environment.  Native American art, design, and architecture produced beautiful artifacts, religion, and lifestyle, but after the appearance of the 'more advanced' culture from the east the original inhabitants were moved around and dispersed.  The very few things that remained are their cultural heritage and artifacts scattered around.  At this time of rapid production and consumption, their primitive lifestyle, close to nature, seems to become a necessary utopia.  The dislocated Funky Bone benches installed in the park stand symbolic for the leftovers of their sold culture and the spread of Native Americans over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to resonating with the location's history, ''Funky Bones'' also has the functional purpose of providing an ideal spot for visitors to sit, [[picnic]], lounge, or climb.&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joep van Lieshout observed visitors sitting on rocks during visits to the site, and decided to provide them with more comfortable seating arrangements in order to facilitate interaction, both among viewers as well as between viewer and art.&lt;ref name="fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones, Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PM/493_Filename_Art%20Nature%20Park%20Fact%20Sheet_Atelier%20Van%20Leishout.pdf|accessdate=25 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of interactivity, and even fun, makes ''Funky Bones'' extremely child-friendly.&lt;ref name="Wiltrout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiltrout|first=Nicole|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art's 100 Acres|publisher=Indiana Insider|date=19 Jul 2011|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/07/19/indianapolis-museum-of-arts-100-acres/|accessdate=5 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Atelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary company that operates internationally in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture.  Joep van Lieshout (born 1963), founder of AVL, is a Dutch artist born in Ravenstein, The Netherlands.  He received his formal education and training from the Academy of Modern Art in Rotterdam (1980–1985), [[Ateliers '63]] in Haarlem (1985-1987), and from the [[Villa Arson]] in Nice, France (1987).  Joep van Lieshout formed the AVL studio group in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the company continues to design and fabricate their widely exhibited works.  Atelier Van Lieshout has attained international recognition for objects-based projects that balance on the boundary between art, architecture and design.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Recurring themes in the work of AVL include self-sufficiency, power, politics, and the more classical themes of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout webpage|publisher=Atelier Van Lieshout|url=http://www.ateliervanlieshout.com/|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Atelier Van Lieshout emphasizes the fact that, although Joep van Lieshout founded and leads the collective, the work produced stems from the creative impulses of the entire team.&lt;ref name="Benda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Friedman Benda|url=http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127053738/http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Funky Bones,'' AVL's most relevant recurring themes are domestication, politics, complex functioning systems, and the re-contextualization of familiar, domestic objects.  The Atelier van Lieshout claims to make no distinction between "real artworks" and "just building something for someone."&lt;ref name="Dellinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=Jade|author2=Hester Schaaf|title=FAQ's about the Atelier Van Lieshout|journal=REVEALED!!! STAFF TELLS ALL ...|year=1998|pages=31|publisher=Nicoline Gatehouse|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studio group focuses on creating artworks whose design principles challenge conventional ideas of utility and functionality by reinventing how the viewer perceives or approaches an object and the environment in which it is placed.  This is achieved by the implementation of  non-traditional materials and color palettes, odd or unusual subject matter, and through the strategic positioning or locale of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Dellinger"/&gt; ''Funky Bones'' is impossible to see in its entirety except at a distance, preferably from above. Moving close enough to actually interact with it produces an entirely different perspective.&lt;ref name="Schengen"/&gt;

==Condition==
In general, the bones require regular cleaning in order to maintain their white color. Instrumental analysis involving the artwork's color and gloss levels has been recorded for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Nicole|title=Art, Color, and Gloss|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/blog/2011/07/13/art-color-and-gloss/|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', by Indianapolis-based author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], the sculpture is the location of a romantic picnic, having been picked by one of the characters as being the most Dutch place in Indianapolis. ''Funky Bones'' was recreated in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] for the film adaptation of ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The recreation was built by set designers, with help from the artist and Sarah Urist Green, wife of John Green, and former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=John|title=Question Tuesday: The Fault in Our Stars Movie Edition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_731GRjCCI|work=vlogbrothers YouTube Channel|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], [[ethics]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]] "'''good and evil'''" is a very common [[dichotomy]]. In cultures with [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] and [[Abrahamic]] religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"&gt;Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. ''Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation''. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. P. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them, and achieving a [[Monism|oneness]].&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"/&gt;

[[Evil]], in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good. Often, evil is used to denote profound [[immorality]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822012937/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"/&gt; Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, elements that are commonly associated with evil involve [[Balance (metaphysics)|unbalanced]] behavior involving expediency, [[selfishness]], [[ignorance]], or [[neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, Jan 14, 2004. P. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[ethics|philosophical]] questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Meta-ethics]] concerning the nature of good and evil, [[Normative ethics]] concerning how we ought to behave, and [[Applied ethics]] concerning particular moral issues.

==History and etymology==

Every language has a word expressing ''good'' in the sense of "having the right or desirable quality" ([[Arete (moral virtue)|ἀρετή]]) and ''bad'' in the sense "undesirable". A sense of [[morality|moral judgment]] and a distinction "right and wrong, good and bad" are [[cultural universals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] (1991) ''Human Universals''. Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]] ([http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm online summary] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630210030/http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm |date=2012-06-30 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===
{{main article|Zoroastrianism}}
In the eastern part of ancient [[Greater Iran|Persia]] almost three thousand years ago a religious philosopher called [[Zoroaster]] simplified the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of early Iranian gods&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_6-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=6–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Dualistic cosmology|two opposing forces]]: [[Ahura Mazda]] ([[Light (theology)|Illuminating]] [[Wisdom]]) and [[Angra Mainyu]] ([[devil|Destructive Spirit]]) which were in conflict. 
{{main article|Gnosticism}}
This idea developed into a religion which spawned many [[sect]]s, some of which embraced an extreme [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] belief that the [[nature|material world]] should be shunned and the [[Sacred|spiritual world]] should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many [[Ancient history|ancient]] religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion| year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK|author=John Hinnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teach that ''[[gnosis]]'' (variously interpreted as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[salvation]], [[emancipation]] or [[Buddhahood|'oneness with God']]) may be reached by practising [[philanthropy]] to the point of personal [[poverty]], [[sexual abstinence]] (as far as possible for ''[[wikt:disciple#Noun|hearers]]'', total for ''[[Initiation|initiates]]'') and diligently searching for [[wisdom]] by helping others.&lt;ref name=gph&gt;{{cite book |title=Gnostic Philosophy: From Ancient Persia to Modern Times|first=Tobias |last=Churton|publisher=Inner Traditions – Bear &amp; Company |date=2005|ISBN=978-159477-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in ancient [[Egypt]], there were the concepts of [[Ma'at]], the principle of justice, order, and cohesion, and [[Isfet_(Egyptian_mythology)|Isfet]], the principle of chaos, disorder, and decay, with the former being the power and principles which society sought to embody where the latter was such that undermined society. This correspondence can also be seen reflected in ancient Mesopotamian religion as well in the conflict between [[Marduk]] and [[Tiamat]].

===Classical world===
In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]], in particular [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Kahn, ''Democritus and the Origins of Moral Psychology'', The American Journal of Philology (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of [[Plato]], together with the emergence of [[monotheistic]] thought (notably in ''[[Euthyphro]]'', which ponders the concept of piety ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in [[Late Antiquity]] by [[Neoplatonists]], [[Gnostics]], and [[Church Fathers]].

This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is also evident in the terms ''[[ethics]]'' and ''[[morality]]'' both being derived from terms for "regional custom", Greek ήθος and Latin ''mores'', respectively (see also ''[[:wikt:siðr|siðr]]'').

===Medieval period===
Medieval theology was largely shaped by [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo, [[sin]] is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."[3][4]

Many medieval Christian [[theologian]]s both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of  ''Good and evil'' until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good and Evil: Interpreting a Human Condition|author=Farley, E|publisher=Fortress Press / Vanderbilt University|year=1990|isbn=978-0800624477}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: 
*a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue which might be earn [[praise]] or [[punishment]] from the [[Theocracy|religious authorities]]
*religious obligation arising from [[Divine law]] leading to [[saint]]hood or [[damnation]]
*a generally accepted [[Norm (social)|cultural standard]] of behaviour which might enhance group [[Human evolution (origins of society and culture)|survival]] or [[wealth]]
*[[natural law]] or behaviour which induces strong emotional reaction
*[[State (polity)|statute law]] imposing a legal [[duty]]

===Modern ideas===

Today the basic [[dichotomy]] often breaks down along these lines:
*''Good'' is a broad concept often associated with [[life]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], continuity, [[happiness]], [[love]], or [[justice]].
*''[[Evil]]'' is often associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary or indiscriminate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Übel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.

The nature of ''being good'' has been given many treatments; one is that the good is based on the natural [[love]], bonding, and affection that begins at the earliest stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing [[truth]]. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an ''aberration'' that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. "[[The Fall of Man]]"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of [[free will]] and [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an [[ignorance]] of [[truth]] (i.e., human value, [[sanctity]], [[divinity]]). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical [[social structure]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Theories of moral goodness==
{{other uses of|good|Good (disambiguation)}}

===Chinese moral philosophy===
{{Main|Confucius#Ethics|Taoism#Ethics}}
In [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], there is no direct analogue to the way good and evil are opposed, although references to demonic influence is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Evil would thus correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|basic virtues of Taoism]] (compassion, moderation, and humility) can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&amp;evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W. Chan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Chinese Philosophy'' Feng Youlan, Volume II The Period of Classical Learning (from the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D). Trans. Derk Bodde. Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 ''Origin of Evil''. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===

====Pyrrhonism====
[[Pyrrhonism]] holds that good and evil do not exist by nature, meaning that good and evil do not exist within the things themselves. All judgments of good and evil are relative to the one doing the judging. 

====Spinoza====
[[Benedict de Spinoza]] states:
{{quote|1. By good, I understand that which we certainly know is useful to us. &lt;br /&gt; 2. By evil, on the contrary I understand that which we certainly know hinders us from possessing anything that is good.&lt;ref name="ebgb"&gt;Benedict de Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Part IV ''Of Human Bondage or of the Strength of the Affects'' Definitions translated by W. H. White, Revised by A. H. Stirling, Great Books vol 31, Encyclopædia Britannica 1952 p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Spinoza assumes a [[formal system|quasi-mathematical]] style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' :&lt;ref name="ebgb"/&gt;
* Proposition 8 "''Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.''"
* Proposition 30 "''Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.''"
* Proposition 64 "''The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.''"
** Corollary "''Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.''"
* Proposition 65 "''According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.''"
* Proposition 68 "''If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.''"

====Nietzsche====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', where he essentially says that the natural functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong). He also makes a critique of morality by saying that many who consider themselves to be moral are simply acting from cowardice (wanting to do evil but scared of the repercussions).

=== Psychology ===

====Carl Jung====
[[Carl Jung]], in his book ''[[Answer to Job]]'' and elsewhere, depicted evil as the ''dark side of the Devil''. People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] onto others. Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906151252/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ |date=2008-09-06 }}: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philip Zimbardo ====
In 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219183946/http://www.lucifereffect.com/ |date=2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main article|Problem of evil}}

====Bahá'í Faith====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept for the lacking of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"&gt;{{cite book|author='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Some answered questions |year=1982 |publisher=Bahá'í Publ. Trust |location=Wilmette, Ill. |isbn=0-87743-162-0 |translator=Laura Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, evil does not exist, and is relative to man. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:

"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

====Buddhism====
[[File:Extermination of Evil Tenkeisei crop.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Extermination of Evil]]'', The God of Heavenly Punishment, from the Chinese tradition of [[yin and yang]]. Late [[Heian period]] (12th Century Japan)]]
{{Main article|Buddhist Ethics}}

The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer however from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226193619/https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2017-12-26 }} Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, ''Buddhism and Evil'' Martin Southwold p 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html ''Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person''' Taitetsu Unno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093156/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).

"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563-483 B.C.

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. However, the main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 4.07-08&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. However, once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Moh]], or Attachment
*[[Lobh]], or Greed
*[[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath
*[[Kaam]], or Lust
*[[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism
One who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as "[[Manmukh]]", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the "[[Gurmukh]], who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Arjan|title=The universal ideal of sikhism|journal=Global Dialogue|date=January 2000|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Selfless Service|Sewa]], or selfless service to others.
*[[Simran|Nam Simran]], or meditation upon the divine name.

====Islam====
There is no concept of absolute evil in [[Islam]], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] sense. Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from [[Allah]], whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as ''evil'' or ''bad'' are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will to disobey Allah's orders. See [[Devil (Islam)]].

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of Islam, evil does not have a positive existence in itself and is merely the lack of good, just as darkness is the result of lack of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/RRKT.pdf | title=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth | page=193 | accessdate=June 25, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225308/https://www.alislam.org/library/books/RRKT.pdf | archivedate=March 3, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{see also|Yetzer hara}}
In [[Judaism]], no individual can be defined as categorically, absolutely "good" or "evil."  Judaism recognizes human beings' psychological complexity.  God gave the [[Children of Israel]] the [[Torah]] as a guide to overcome evil.  A common theme of [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish philosophy before Maimonides|medieval Jewish philosophy]] is that people who do good deeds will be rewarded in ''[[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|olam haba]]''.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07647.html "Good &amp; Evil."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020040331/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07647.html |date=2016-10-20 }} ''Jewish Virtual Library''.  2008.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has two conflicting attitudes toward the existence of evil.  In one interpretation, evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions.  In the other interpretation, evil was created by God since God created everything and to suggest otherwise would be to engage in [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and is therefore antithetical to the core Jewish belief in [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="JVL" /&gt;

====Christianity====
{{see also|Devil#Christianity}}
Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is ''contrary'' to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament.  Therefore, evil in a Christian world view is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God. Similarly, good according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is ''consistent'' with the character or the will of God, for God is good, the ultimate goodness. 

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises “the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.”&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, SUMMA THEOLOGICA, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in experience that ''ought not to be''."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.

[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.

====Zoroastrianism====
In the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battle ground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Descriptive, meta-ethical, and normative fields==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
It is possible to treat the essential theories of value by the use of a philosophical and academic approach. In properly analyzing theories of value, everyday beliefs are not only carefully ''catalogued'' and ''described'', but also rigorously ''analyzed'' and ''judged''.

There are at least two basic ways of presenting a theory of value, based on two different kinds of questions:
* What do people find good, and what do they despise?
* What really is good, and what really is bad?

The two questions are subtly different. One may answer the first question by researching the world by use of social science, and examining the preferences that people assert. However, one may answer the second question by use of reasoning, introspection, prescription, and generalization. The former kind of method of analysis is called "[[descriptive]]", because it attempts to describe what people actually view as good or evil; while the latter is called "[[Normative ethics|normative]]", because it tries to actively prohibit evils and cherish goods. These descriptive and normative approaches can be complementary. For example, tracking the decline of the popularity of slavery across cultures is the work of [[descriptive ethics]], while advising that slavery be avoided is normative.

[[Meta-ethics]] is the study of the fundamental questions concerning the nature and origins of the good and the evil, including inquiry into the nature of good and evil, as well as the meaning of evaluative language. In this respect, meta-ethics is not necessarily tied to investigations into how others see the good, or of asserting what is good.

==Theories of the intrinsically good==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
A satisfying formulation of goodness is valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration, or prioritization. One could answer the ancient question, "How should we then live?" among many other important related questions. It has long been thought that this question can best be answered by examining what it is that necessarily makes a thing valuable, or in what the source of value consists.

===Platonic idealism===
One attempt to define goodness describes it as a property of the world with [[Platonic idealism]]. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. [[Plato]] advocated this view, in his expression that there is such a thing as an eternal realm of [[substantial form|forms]] or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good.  The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint.  The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm.  The good is the [[harmony]] of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of [[virtues]], and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature.  The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.

A [[theism|theist]] is a person who believes that the [[God|Supreme Being]] exists or [[deity|gods]] exist ([[monotheism]] or [[polytheism]]). A theist may, therefore, claim that the universe has a purpose and value according to the will of such [[creator deity|creator]](s) that lies partially beyond human understanding. For instance, [[Thomas Aquinas]]—a proponent of this view—believed he had proven the [[existence of God]], and the right relations that humans ought to have to the divine [[first cause]].

Monotheists might also hope for infinite universal love. Such hope is often translated as "[[faith]]", and [[wisdom]] itself is largely defined within some religious doctrines as ''a knowledge and understanding of innate goodness.'' The concepts of [[innocence]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[wikt:Purity|purity]], and [[salvation]] are likewise related to a concept of being in, or returning to, a state of '' goodness''—one that, according to various teachings of "[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]", approaches a state of ''holiness'' (or ''Godliness'').

===Perfectionism===
[[Aristotle]] believed that virtues consisted of realization of potentials unique to humanity, such as the use of reason. This type of view, called [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]], has been recently defended in modern form by [[Thomas Hurka]].

An entirely different form of perfectionism has arisen in response to rapid technological change. Some [[techno-optimist]]s, especially [[transhumanism|transhumanists]], avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, [[genetic engineering]] of humans, [[artificial intelligence]]. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by [[persuasion technology]] and probably brute force of violent [[technological escalation]], which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them.

===Welfarist theories===
Welfarist theories of value say things that are good are such because of their positive effects on human well-being.

====Subjective theories of well-being====
It is difficult to figure out where an immaterial trait such as "goodness" could reside in the world. A counterproposal is to locate values inside people. Some philosophers go so far as to say that if some [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] does not tend to arouse a desirable subjective state in self-aware beings, then it cannot be good.

Most philosophers that think goods have to create desirable mental states also say that goods are experiences of self-aware beings. These philosophers often distinguish the experience, which they call an intrinsic good, from the things that seem to cause the experience, which they call "inherent"  goods. Failing to distinguish the two leads to a [[subject–object problem]] in which it is not clear who is evaluating what object.

Some theories describe no higher collective value than that of maximizing ''pleasure'' for individual(s). Some even define goodness and intrinsic value as the experience of pleasure, and bad as the experience of pain. This view is called [[hedonism]], a ''monistic theory of value''. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean.

''Simple hedonism'' is the view that physical pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher [[Epicurus]] used the word 'pleasure' in a more general sense that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief. Contrary to popular caricature, he valued pleasures of the mind to bodily pleasures, and advocated moderation as the surest path to happiness.

[[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham's]] book ''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]'' prioritized goods by considering pleasure, pain and consequences. This theory had a wide effect on public affairs, up to and including the present day. A similar system was later named [[Utilitarianism]] by [[John Stuart Mill]]. More broadly, utilitarian theories are examples of Consequentialism. All utilitarian theories are based upon the ''maxim of utility'', which states that ''good'' is whatever provides ''the greatest happiness for the greatest number''. It follows from this principle that what brings happiness to the greatest number of people, is good.

A benefit of tracing good to pleasure and pain is that both are easily understandable, both in oneself and to an extent in others. For the hedonist, the explanation for helping behaviour may come in the form of ''empathy''—the ability of a being to "feel" another's pain. People tend to value the lives of gorillas more than those of mosquitoes because the gorilla lives and feels, making it easier to empathize with them. This idea is carried forward in the [[ethical relationship]] view and has given rise to the [[animal rights]] movement and parts of the [[peace movement]]. The impact of sympathy on human behaviour is compatible with [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] views, including [[David Hume]]'s stances that the idea of a self with unique identity is illusory, and that morality ultimately comes down to sympathy and fellow feeling for others, or the exercise of approval underlying moral judgments.

A view adopted by James Griffin attempts to find a subjective alternative to hedonism as an intrinsic value. He argues that the satisfaction of one's informed desires constitutes well-being, whether or not these desires actually bring the agent happiness. Moreover, these preferences must be life-relevant, that is, contribute to the success of a person's life overall.

Desire satisfaction may occur without the agent's awareness of the satisfaction of the desire. For example, if a man wishes for his legal will to be enacted after his death, and it is, then his desire has been satisfied even though he will never experience or know of it.

[[Meher Baba]] proposed that it is not the satisfaction of desires that motivates the agent but rather "a desire to be free from the limitation of all desires. Those experiences and actions which increase the fetters of desire are bad, and those experiences and actions which tend to emancipate the mind from limiting desires are good."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]. ''Discourses.'' '''1'''. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 93. {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through good actions, then, that the agent becomes free from selfish desires and achieves a state of well-being: "The good is the main link between selfishness thriving and dying. Selfishness, which in the beginning is the father of evil tendencies, becomes through good deeds the hero of its own defeat. When the evil tendencies are completely replaced by good tendencies, selfishness is transformed into selflessness, i.e., individual selfishness loses itself in universal interest."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]. ''Discourses.'' '''1'''. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 31. {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective theories of well-being====
{{See also|Wealth#separate analysis}}
The idea that the ultimate good exists and is not orderable but is globally measurable is reflected in various ways in economic ([[classical economics]], [[green economics]], [[welfare economics]], [[gross national happiness]]) and scientific ([[positive psychology]], the [[science of morality]]) [[measuring well-being|well-being measuring]] theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so-called [[genuine progress indicator]]. Modern economics thus reflects very ancient philosophy, but a calculation or quantitative or other process based on cardinality and [[statistics]] replaces the simple ordering of values.

For example, in both economics and in folk wisdom, the value of something seems to rise so long as it is relatively scarce. However, if it becomes too scarce, it leads often to a conflict, and can reduce collective value.

In the classical [[political economy]] of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], and in its critique by [[Karl Marx]], ''human labour'' is seen as the ultimate source of all new economic value. This is an ''objective'' theory of value (see [[value theory]]), which attributes value to real production-costs, and ultimately expenditures of human labour-time (see also [[law of value]]). It contrasts with [[marginal utility]] theory, which argues that the value of labour depends on subjective preferences by consumers, which may however also be objectively studied.

The economic value of labour may be assessed technically in terms of its [[use-value]] or [[utility]] or commercially in terms of its [[exchange-value]], [[price]] or production cost (see also [[labour power]]. But its value may also be socially assessed in terms of its contribution to the [[wealth]] and [[well-being]] of a society.

In non-market societies, labour may be valued primarily in terms of skill, time, and output, as well as moral or social criteria and legal obligations. In market societies, labour is valued economically primarily through the [[labour market]]. The price of labour may then be set by supply and demand, by [[strike action]] or legislation, or by legal or professional entry-requirements into occupations.

====Mid-range theories====
[[Conceptual metaphor]] theories argue against both subjective and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] conceptions of value and meaning, and focus on the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an [[ontology]] problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some [[abstraction]] or a strict standoff between parties who have no way to understand each other's views.

==Philosophical questions==

=== Universality ===
[[File:Don't Kid Yourself...it's Up to You. Stop Him^ - NARA - 534297.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | title=Top 25 Political Icons - Adolf Hitler | work=Time | date=February 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 27, 2011 | author=Sanburn, Josh | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826220011/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | archivedate=August 26, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about 50 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003). ''Government Leaders, Military Rulers, and Political Activists.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 83. {{ISBN|978-1-57356-153-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. However, the numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the [[United States]]—along with many other countries—practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.

The [[Nazism|Nazis]], during [[World War II]], considered [[genocide]] to be acceptable,&lt;ref name="evil"&gt;Gaymon Bennett, Ted Peters, Martinez J. Hewlett, Robert John Russell (2008). ''The evolution of evil''. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. p.318. {{ISBN|3-525-56979-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[Hutu]] [[Interahamwe]] in the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name="Gourevitch, 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gourevitch |first=Philip |title=We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With our Families |publisher=Picador |isbn=0-312-24335-9 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontline: the triumph of evil.|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/|accessdate=2007-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419061642/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/|archivedate=2007-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might point out, though, that the actual perpetrators of those atrocities probably avoided calling their actions genocide, since the objective meaning of any act accurately described by that word is to wrongfully kill a selected group of people, which is an action that at least their victims will understand to be evil. Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil.{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2010}} Other universalists might argue that although the commission of an evil act is always evil, those who perpetrate may not be wholly evil or wholly good entities. To say that someone who has stolen a candy bar, for instance, becomes wholly evil is a rather untenable position. However, universalists might also argue that a person can choose a decidedly evil or a decidedly good life career, and genocidal dictatorship plainly falls on the side of the former.

Views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of four opposed camps:

* [[Moral absolutism]] holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by a [[deity]] or [[deities]], nature, morality, common sense, or some other source.
* [[Amoralism]] claims that good and evil are meaningless, that there is no moral ingredient in nature.
* [[Moral relativism]] holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture, custom, or prejudice.
* [[Moral universalism]] is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality, and the relativist view; universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree, and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans.

[[Plato]] wrote that there are relatively few ways to do good, but there are countless ways to do evil, which can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives, and the lives of other beings capable of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sources of Evil According to Plato |first=Harold |last=Cherniss |authorlink=Harold F. Cherniss |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=1954 |isbn=9004052356 |pages=23–30 |jstor=3143666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usefulness as a term===
One school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil, and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—''punitive justice''—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} in which the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.

Psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.

American psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983;1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].

According to Peck, an evil person:&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978;1992), ''The Road Less Travelled''. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and maintaining a [[self-image]] of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]]
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* [[Psychological projection|Psychologically projects]] his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, [[scapegoating]] those targets while treating everyone else normally ("their insensitivity toward him was selective")&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1983/1988, p105&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others
* Abuses political or emotional power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion")&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1978/1992, p298&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent in his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim
* Has a covert intolerance to [[criticism]] and other forms of [[narcissistic injury]]

He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.

===Necessary evil===
[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]
[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for [[the Devil]], so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings... ."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke'', XX, p58&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain{{which|date=August 2013}} schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon practicality; this approach to politics was put forth by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], a 16th-century [[Florence, Italy|Florentine]] writer who advised politicians "...it is far safer to be feared than loved."&lt;ref name = "erragh"&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', Dante University of America Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-937832-38-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-937832-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international relations]] theories of [[Realism in international relations|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], sometimes called ''[[realpolitik]]'' advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly [[amorality|amoral]] and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a ''higher moral duty'' specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: "...there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince."&lt;ref name = "erragh"/&gt;

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]], was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word ''evil'' is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women, or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, ''The Satanic Bible'', Avon, 1969, {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goodness and agency==

===Goodwill===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
[[John Rawls]]' book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' prioritized social arrangements and goods based on their contribution to [[justice]]. Rawls defined justice as ''fairness'', especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if rational individuals'  goods are considered fairly. Rawls's crucial invention was the [[original position]], a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one's moral calculations.

One problem{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} with the thinkings of Rawls is that it is overly procedural. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.

Applying procedural fairness to an entire society therefore seems certain to create recognizable inefficiencies {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, and therefore be unfair, and (by the equivalence of justice with fairness) unjust.

However, procedural processes are not always necessarily damning in this way. [[Immanuel Kant]], a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of ''The Categorical Imperative'', however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. Even though an example like the one above regarding the orange would not be something that required the practical application of ''The Categorical Imperative'', it is important{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} to draw distinction between Kant and Rawls, and note that Kant's Theory would not necessarily lead to the same problems Rawls' does—i.e., the cutting in half of the orange. Kant's Theory promotes acting out of Duty—acting for the Summum Bonum for him, ''The Good Will''—and in fact encourages Judgement, too. What this would mean{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} is that the outcome of the Orange's distribution would not be such a simple process for Kant as the reason why it would be wanted by both parties would necessarily have to be a part of the Judgement process, thus eliminating the problem that Rawls' account suffers here.

===Society, life and ecology===
{{essay|section|date=September 2012}}
Many views value ''unity'' as a good: to go beyond [[eudaimonia]] by saying that an individual person's flourishing is valuable only as a means to the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of [[Confucianism]] are an example of this, encouraging the view that people ought to conform as individuals to demands of a peaceful and ordered society.

According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing of society is not, or not the only, intrinsically good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to [[biology]], and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as [[Great Ape personhood]]. Others go farther, declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value.

By another approach, one achieves peace and agreement by focusing, not on one's peers (who may be rivals or competitors), but on the common environment.  The reasoning:  As living beings it is clearly and objectively good that we are surrounded by an [[ecosystem]] that supports [[life]]. Indeed, if we weren't, we could neither discuss that good nor even recognize it. The [[anthropic principle]] in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] recognizes this view.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Under [[materialism]] or even [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] values, or in any system that recognizes the validity of [[ecology]] as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, [[Earth]]. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words,  good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as "not good enough", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning to be satisfied with them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called [[Contentment|satisfaction]].

Values and the people that hold them seem necessarily subordinate to the ecosystem. If this is so, then what kind of being could validly apply the word "good" to an ecosystem as a whole? Who would have the power to assess and judge an ecosystem as good or bad? By what criteria? And by what criteria would ecosystems be modified, especially larger ones such as the [[atmosphere]] ([[climate change]]) or [[ocean]]s ([[extinction]]) or [[forests]] ([[deforestation]])?&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see debates on [[monoculture]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

"Remaining on Earth" as the most basic value. While [[green politics|green]] [[list of ethicists|ethicists]] have been most forthright about it, and have developed theories of [[Gaia philosophy]], [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]], [[bioregionalism]] that reflect it, the questions are now universally recognized as central in determining value, e.g. the economic "[[value of Earth]]" to humans as a whole, or the "[[value of life]]" that is neither whole-Earth nor human. Many have come to the conclusion that without assuming ecosystem continuation as a universal good, with attendant [[virtue]]s like [[biodiversity]] and [[ecological wisdom]] it is impossible to justify such operational requirements as [[sustainability]] of human activity on Earth.

One response is that humans are not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that only a tiny fraction of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do [[technological escalation]] on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that [[extraterrestrial life]] would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a [[locust]] species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no [[extraterrestrials]] who compete with [[humans]] to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] than it would take to construct some new habitat.

Accordingly, remaining on Earth, as a living being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement of the most basic values and goodness to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not actionable.

However, most religious systems acknowledge an [[afterlife]] and improving this is seen as an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks [[honour|honor]] or power over self is less desirable—consider [[seppuku]] in [[bushido]], [[kamikaze]]s or the role of [[suicide attack]]s in [[Jihadi]] rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no higher than a third-place value.

Radical values [[environmentalism]] can be seen as either a very old or a very new view: that the only intrinsically good thing is a flourishing ecosystem; individuals and societies are merely instrumentally valuable,  good only as means to having a flourishing ecosystem. The [[Gaia philosophy]] is the most detailed expression of this overall thought but it strongly influenced [[deep ecology]] and the modern [[Green Parties]].

It is often claimed that [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples never lost this sort of view. [[Anthropological linguistics]] studies links between their languages and the ecosystems they lived in, which gave rise to their [[knowledge]] distinctions. Very often, environmental cognition and [[moral]] cognition were not distinguished in these languages. Offenses to nature were like those to other people, and [[Animism]] reinforced this by giving nature "personality" via [[mythology|myth]]. [[Anthropological theories of value]] explore these questions.

Most people in the world reject older [[situated ethics]] and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value.

===History and novelty===
{{wikiquote|goodness}}
{{wikiquote|evil}}

An event is often seen as being of value simply because of its ''novelty'' in fashion and art. By contrast, cultural history and other antiques are sometimes seen as of value in and of themselves due to their ''age''. Philosopher-historians Will and Ariel Durant spoke as much with the quote, "As the sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories, so the sanity of the group lies in the continuity of its traditions; in either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction" (The Lessons of History, 72).

Assessment of the value of old or historical artifacts takes into consideration, especially but not exclusively: the value placed on having a detailed knowledge of the past, the desire to have tangible ties to ancestral history, or the increased market value scarce items traditionally hold.

[[Creativity]] and [[innovation]] and [[invention]] are sometimes upheld as fundamentally good especially in Western industrial society—all imply newness, and even opportunity to profit from novelty. [[Bertrand Russell]] was notably pessimistic about creativity and thought that [[knowledge]] expanding faster than [[wisdom]] necessarily was fatal.

==Goodness and morality in biology==
The issue of good and evil in the human visuality, often associated with [[morality]], is regarded by some biologists (notably [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">According to the '''growing block universe theory of time''' (or the '''growing block view'''), the past and present exist and the future does not exist. The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of [[spacetime]], where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.

The growing block view is an alternative to both [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to [[common sense|common-sense]] intuitions than the alternatives. [[C. D. Broad]] was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are [[Michael Tooley]] (in 1997) and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] (in 2004).

==Criticism==
Recently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and [[Trenton Merricks]] have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of "now" is an [[indexical]] and the second occurrence of "now" is the [[objective tensed property]]. Their observation implies the following sentence: "This part of spacetime has the property of being present".)

Take [[Socrates]] discussing, in the past, with [[Gorgias]], and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being.  But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.

However, some{{who|date=October 2017}} have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.

The '''Hyde Park Barracks Museum''' is a brick building and [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] designed by convict architect [[Francis Greenway]] between 1818 and 1819; originally built at the head of [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] (1819) to house [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] men and boys.

The site is managed by the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]] as a [[museum]] open to the public for a modest fee. The site is listed on [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045722|Hyde Park Barracks|hr=00190|fn=S90/01189; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Commonwealth Heritage List]], and is inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] as one of 11 pre-eminent [[Australian Convict Sites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories and Histories|url=http://www.hht.net.au/discover/highlights/articles/barracks_world_heritage_listing|website=Sydney Living History Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as amongst "the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts."&lt;ref name="WorldHeritage02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Convict Sites|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1306|website=World Heritage Convention|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Convict Sites|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/australian-convict-sites-world%20heritage-nomination|website=Department of the Environment|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Image:HydeParkBarracksDrawingHardyWilson1914.jpg|Hyde Park Barracks in a 1914 drawing by [[William Hardy Wilson]]|thumb|upright|left]]

Constructed by convict labour by order of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]], the Barracks is one of the most familiar works of the accomplished colonial England-born, Australian architect [[Francis Howard Greenway]]. As the principal male convict barracks in [[New South Wales]] it provided lodgings for convicts working in government employment around Sydney until its closure in mid-1848.

It has had many occupants since then.  It was an Immigration Depot for single female immigrants seeking work as domestic servants and awaiting family reunion from 1848 to 1886 and also a female asylum from 1862 to 1886.  From 1887 to 1979 law courts and government offices were based at the Barracks. Construction began in 1817.

== Museum ==
In 1991, Hyde Park Barracks underwent conservation and adaptation work by award-winning architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and conservation architects [[Clive Lucas|Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners]]. The completed project won the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] national Lachlan Macquarie Award in 1992. Now, the newly installed Hyde Park Barracks is a museum operated by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.  Tourists who visit the building discover the daily lives of convicts and other occupants through exhibitions on Sydney's male convict labour force, Australia's convict system, an innovative soundscape, excavated artefacts, exposed layers of building fabric and the complex's rooms and spaces.

In June 2015, [[Mark Speakman]] the [[Minister for the Environment (New South Wales)|Minister for the Environment of New South Wales]] announced Unlocking Heritage, a two-year program aimed at giving children the opportunity to experience Sydney's living museums. This program will allow students to wear convict clothing and sleep in the Barrack's hammocks. A million dollars has been allocated for this program. Museum director Mark Goggin thinks that children will learn more about history if they can experience it hands-on, '"Particularly for the kids to wear the convict shirts, eat the gruel, sleep over with their mates in hammocks and imagining what life was like 200 years ago."' The program is starting out with children and hoping to expand to adult participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donegan|first1=John|title=Sydney's Hyde Park Barracks site of student sleepover as museum receives funding injection|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-12/new-funding-to-make-sydney-living-museums-more-accessible/6538892|publisher=702 ABC Sydney|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Heritage listing ==
In July 2010, at the 34th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the Hyde Park Barracks and ten other Australian sites with a significant association with convict transportation were inscribed as a group on the World Heritage List as the [[Australian Convict Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = UNESCO World Heritage Centre – World Heritage Committee inscribes seven cultural sites on World Heritage List |work = UNESCO World Heritage Centre website | publisher = United Nations | date = 31 July 2010 | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/642 | accessdate = 17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing explains that the 11 sites present "the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts". Of the 11 sites the [[Great North Road, Australia|Old Great North Road]], [[Old Government House, Parramatta|Old Government House]] at Parramatta and [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] are also within the Sydney region.

== Operations ==
According to the Living Museum website, the fees for admission as of 2015 are $10 for adult admission, $5 for children or commissions, $20 for families (two adults and two children) and free to members.  Group and school tours are available by phoning the museum. Hours of operation are 10am – 5pm daily. Closed on Christmas and Good Friday. The Hyde Barracks are one fourth of the Sydney Living History Museum series. The other three are the [[Susannah Place Museum]], the [[Museum of Sydney]] and the Justice &amp; Police Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Living Museums – Hyde Park Barracks Museum|url=http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/hyde-park-barracks-museum|website=Sydney Living Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pass can be purchased at any of the locations that will enable visitors to visit all four locations at a discounted price. Adults $18, Children and Concessions $9. The pass is valid for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Museums Pass|url=http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/sydney-museums-pass|website=Sydney Living Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In camera''''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ŋ|ˈ|k|æ|m|r|ə|,_|-|m|ə|r|ə}}; [[Latin]]: "in a chamber")&lt;ref name=uscourts&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Common/Glossary.aspx | title = Glossary | publisher = USCourts.gov }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[law| legal]] term that means ''in private''.&lt;ref name = Amo /&gt; The same meaning is sometimes expressed in the English equivalent: '''''in chambers'''''. Generally, ''in-camera'' describes [[court]] cases, parts of it, or process where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process.&lt;ref name= Amo&gt;{{Citation | first = Eugene | last = Ehrlich | title = Amo, Amas, Amat and More | page = 151 | ISBN = 0-06-272017-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In-camera'' is the opposite of [[trial]] [[in open court]] where all parties and witnesses testify in a public [[courtroom]], and [[Lawyer|attorneys]] publicly present their arguments to the [[trier of fact]].

==''In camera'' hearings during trials==
Entire cases may be heard ''in-camera'' when, for example, matters of [[national security]] are involved. ''In-camera'' review by a judge may be used during otherwise open trials—for example, to protect trade secrets or where one party asserts privilege (such as [[attorney–client privilege]]d communications).  This lets the judge review documents in private to determine if revelation of documents in open court will be allowed.

In United States courts in-camera review describes a process or procedure where a judge privately looks at confidential, sensitive, or private information to determine what, if any, information may be used by a party or made public. An ''in camera review'' may be at someone's request (such as counsel in the case), or by order of the court. 

An example of "in-camera review" by the court: a defendant prosecuted for the alleged murder of a high school student asserts his was an act of self-defense, a last resort after the deceased physically assaulted the defendant. Witnesses tell investigators and lawyers that the victim "was always getting into fights in school" and frequently had to visit the principal's office. The defendant seeks to obtain the deceased's high school files to see if there's anything proving the deceased fighting at school. A party for the deceased's family might argue against disclosure on the basis that school records which are presumably private should not be provided to the defendant. While a judge might acknowledge the general presumption, the court might permit the defendant limited use at trial any school records that may establish the deceased's physically aggressive tendencies. 

In this example, before allowing disclosure of files to the defendant, or for revelation of the records to the jury, the judge would "in camera" inspect the deceased's high school records to determine what records, if any, the judge will release to the defendant. Note: The judge has complete authority on an in-camera review. The judge may disallow use of some or all of the records reviewed, limit use or purpose, and to order a party to take all steps necessary to keep private and confidential the information released. 

==Non-legal definitions==
''In-camera'' can also describe closed board meetings that cover information not recorded in the minutes or divulged to the public. Such sessions may discuss personnel, financial, or other sensitive decisions that must be kept secret (e.g., a proposed merger or strategic change the organization does not want disclosed to competitors). It can also apply to diplomatic and political affairs, such as during the American [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 when the drafting of the [[Constitution of the United States]] was discussed in such strict privacy so delegates could negotiate in full confidence that they were free to reconsider particular positions as necessary without embarrassment or political repercussions with their constituents. 

''In camera'' may also mean the portion of a graduate level thesis examination that includes only the examining committee and the student.  This follows a presentation by the student that the public may attend.

[[Image:Indicator function illustration.png|right|thumb|A three-dimensional plot of an indicator function, shown over a square two-dimensional domain (set X): the 'raised' portion overlays those two-dimensional points which are members of the 'indicated' subset (A).]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''indicator function''' or a '''characteristic function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' that indicates membership of an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in a [[subset]] ''A'' of ''X'', having the value 1 for all elements of ''A'' and the value 0 for all elements of ''X'' not in ''A''. It is usually denoted by a symbol 1 or ''I'', sometimes in boldface or  [[blackboard bold]]face, with a subscript specifying the subset.

In other contexts, such as [[computer science]], this would more often be described as a '''boolean [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] function''' (to test set inclusion).

==Definition==
The indicator function of a subset ''A'' of a set ''X'' is a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A \colon X \to \{ 0,1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A(x) :=
\begin{cases}
1 &amp;\text{if } x \in A, \\
0 &amp;\text{if } x \notin A.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Iverson bracket]] allows the equivalent notation, &lt;math&gt;[x\in A]&lt;/math&gt;, to be used instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi_A&lt;/math&gt;, ''K&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' or even just &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. (The [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; appears because it is the initial letter of the Greek word χαρακτήρ, which is the ultimate origin of the word ''characteristic''.)

The set of all indicator functions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, both sets are sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt;. This is a special case (&lt;math&gt;Y =\{0,1\}=2&lt;/math&gt;) of the notation &lt;math&gt;Y^X&lt;/math&gt; for the set of all functions &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y &lt;/math&gt;.

==Remark on notation and terminology==
* The notation &lt;math&gt;1_A&lt;/math&gt; is also used to denote the [[identity function]] of ''A''.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}
* The notation &lt;math&gt;\chi_A&lt;/math&gt; is also used to denote the [[Characteristic function (convex analysis)|characteristic function]] in [[convex analysis]].{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

A related concept in [[statistics]] is that of a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. (This must not be confused with "dummy variables" as that term is usually used in mathematics, also called a [[free variables and bound variables|bound variable]].)

The term "[[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]" has an unrelated meaning in [[probability theory|classic probability theory]]. For this reason, [[List of probabilists|traditional probabilists]] use the term '''indicator function''' for the function defined here almost exclusively, while mathematicians in other fields are more likely to use the term ''characteristic function'' to describe the function that indicates membership in a set.

In [[fuzzy logic]] and [[Many-valued logic|modern many-valued logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

==Basic properties==
The ''indicator'' or ''characteristic'' [[function (mathematics)|function]] of a subset ''A'' of some set ''X'', [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] elements of ''X'' to the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] {0,1}.

This mapping is [[surjective]] only when ''A'' is a non-empty [[proper subset]] of ''X''. If ''A'' ≡ ''X'', then
'''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. By a similar argument, if ''A'' ≡ Ø then '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

In the following, the dot represents multiplication, 1·1 = 1, 1·0 = 0 etc. "+" and "−" represent addition and subtraction. "&lt;math&gt;\cap &lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;\cup &lt;/math&gt;" is intersection and union, respectively.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are two subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{A\cap B} = \min\{\mathbf{1}_A,\mathbf{1}_B\} = \mathbf{1}_A \cdot\mathbf{1}_B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{A\cup B} = \max\{{\mathbf{1}_A,\mathbf{1}_B}\} = \mathbf{1}_A + \mathbf{1}_B - \mathbf{1}_A \cdot\mathbf{1}_B,&lt;/math&gt;
and the indicator function of the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;A^C&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_{A^\complement} = 1-\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, suppose &lt;math&gt;A_1, \dotsc, A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of subsets of ''X''.  For any
''x'' ∈ ''X'':

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k \in I} ( 1 - \mathbf{1}_{A_k}(x))&lt;/math&gt;

is clearly a product of 0s and 1s.  This product has the value 1 at
precisely those ''x'' ∈ ''X'' that belong to none of the sets ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and
is 0 otherwise. That is

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{k \in I} ( 1 - \mathbf{1}_{A_k}) = \mathbf{1}_{X - \bigcup_{k} A_k} = 1 - \mathbf{1}_{\bigcup_{k} A_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the product on the left hand side,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{1}_{\bigcup_{k} A_k}= 1 - \sum_{F \subseteq \{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}} (-1)^{|F|} \mathbf{1}_{\bigcap_F A_k} = \sum_{\emptyset \neq F \subseteq \{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}} (-1)^{|F|+1} \mathbf{1}_{\bigcap_F A_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where |''F''| is the cardinality of ''F''. This is one form of the principle of [[inclusion-exclusion]].

As suggested by the previous example, the indicator function is a useful notational device in [[combinatorics]].  The notation is used in other places as well, for instance in [[probability theory]]: if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability space]] with probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable set]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[random variable]] whose [[expected value]] is equal to the probability of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{1}_A)= \int_{X} \mathbf{1}_A(x)\,d\mathbb{P} = \int_{A} d\mathbb{P} = \operatorname{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

This identity is used in a simple proof of [[Markov's inequality]].

In many cases, such as [[order theory]], the inverse of the indicator function may be defined. This is commonly called the [[generalized Möbius function]], as a generalization of the inverse of the indicator function in elementary [[number theory]], the [[Möbius function]]. (See paragraph below about the use of the inverse in classical recursion theory.)

==Mean, variance and covariance==
Given a [[probability space]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;, the indicator random variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A \colon \Omega \rightarrow \Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A (\omega) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \omega \in A,&lt;/math&gt; otherwise &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A (\omega) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Mean]]: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{1}_A (\omega)) = \operatorname{P}(A) &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Variance]]: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{1}_A (\omega)) = \operatorname{P}(A)(1 - \operatorname{P}(A)) &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Covariance]]: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Cov}(\mathbf{1}_A (\omega), \mathbf{1}_B (\omega)) = \operatorname{P}(A \cap B) - \operatorname{P}(A)\operatorname{P}(B) &lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristic function in recursion theory, Gödel's and Kleene's ''representing function''==
[[Kurt Gödel]] described the ''representing function'' in his 1934 paper "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems". (The paper appears on pp.&amp;nbsp;41–74 in [[Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable''):
:"There shall correspond to each class or relation R a representing function φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 if R(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 if ~R(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . ., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)." (p. 42; the "~" indicates logical inversion i.e. "NOT")

[[Stephen Kleene]] (1952) (p.&amp;nbsp;227) offers up the same definition in the context of the [[primitive recursive function]]s as a function φ of a predicate P takes on values 0 if the predicate is true and 1 if the predicate is false.

For example, because the product of characteristic functions φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* . . . *φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 whenever any one of the functions equals 0, it plays the role of logical OR: IF φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 OR φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 OR . . . OR φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 THEN their product is 0. What appears to the modern reader as the representing function's logical inversion, i.e. the representing function is 0 when the function R is "true" or satisfied", plays a useful role in Kleene's definition of the logical  functions OR, AND, and IMPLY (p.&amp;nbsp;228), the bounded- (p.&amp;nbsp;228) and unbounded- (p.&amp;nbsp;279ff) [[mu operator]]s (Kleene (1952)) and the CASE function (p.&amp;nbsp;229).

==Characteristic function in fuzzy set theory==
In classical mathematics, characteristic functions of sets only take values 1 (members) or 0 (non-members). In [[fuzzy set theory]], characteristic functions are generalized to take value in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], or more generally, in some [[universal algebra|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (usually required to be at least a [[partially ordered set|poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Such generalized characteristic functions are more usually called [[membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]s, and the corresponding "sets" are called ''fuzzy'' sets. Fuzzy sets model the gradual change in the membership [[degree of truth|degree]] seen in many real-world [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]s like "tall", "warm", etc.

==Derivatives of the indicator function==
A particular indicator function is the [[Heaviside step function]]. The Heaviside step function  ''H''(''x'') is the indicator function of the one-dimensional positive half-line, i.e. the domain [0, ∞). The [[distributional derivative]] of the Heaviside step function is equal to the [[Dirac delta function]], i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta(x)=\tfrac{d H(x)}{dx},
&lt;/math&gt;

with the following property:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, \delta(x) dx =  f(0).
&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of the Heaviside step function can be seen as the 'inward normal derivative' at the 'boundary' of the domain given by the positive half-line. In higher dimensions, the derivative naturally generalises to the inward normal derivative, while the Heaviside step function naturally generalises to the indicator function of some domain ''D''. The surface of ''D'' will be denoted by ''S''. Proceeding, it can be derived that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] gives rise to a 'surface delta function', which can be indicated by δ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;('''x'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_S(\mathbf{x})=-\mathbf{n}_x\cdot\nabla_x\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in D}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the outward [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] of the surface ''S''. This 'surface delta function' has the following property:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lange|first=Rutger-Jan|year=2012|publisher=Springer|title=Potential theory, path integrals and the Laplacian of the indicator|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2012|pages=29–30|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP11(2012)032|issue=11|bibcode=2012JHEP...11..032L|doi=10.1007/JHEP11(2012)032|arxiv = 1302.0864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-\int_{\mathbf{R}^n}f(\mathbf{x})\,\mathbf{n}_x\cdot\nabla_x\mathbf{1}_{\mathbf{x}\in D}\;d^{n}\mathbf{x}=\oint_{S}\,f(\mathbf{\beta})\;d^{n-1}\mathbf{\beta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By setting the function ''f'' equal to one, it follows that the [[Laplacian of the indicator#Dirac surface delta function|inward normal derivative of the indicator]] integrates to the numerical value of the [[surface area]] ''S''.

The word "[[Value (ethics)|value]]" is both a verb and a noun, each with multiple meanings. But its root meaning always involves social judgments of qualities such as [[good]]ness, worth, [[truth]], [[justice]], [[beauty]]. The word names either the rational criterion applied when judging, or results of judging, the presence of such qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Theory of Valuation|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-3}}&lt;ref name="Tile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tiles|first1=Mary|last2=Oberdiek|first2=Hans|title=Living in a Technological Culture|publisher=Routledge|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–44}} 

Humans attribute qualities to objects, beliefs, and behaviors as they identify means that "work" to carry on [[social interaction|social life]], and ends that are "right" for social life itself.  Qualities that "work" are judged by the '''instrumental criterion''', and are said to possess instrumental value.  Qualities that are "right" in themselves are judged by the '''intrinsic criterion''', and are said to possess intrinsic value.  The value of a smart phone or a scientific theory is instrumental.  The value of the [[Ten Commandments]] or the [[US Constitution]] is intrinsic.

==Overview==
The noun value sometimes names the instrumental or intrinsic criterion being applied.  More often, it names things judged to possess instrumental or intrinsic value.  Modern scholars have refined these ancient common-sense meanings of value.  [[sociology|Sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] applied the labels instrumental and intrinsic value to two patterns of social action.  Here are his original definitions, followed by current labels for the two criteria from the ''Oxford Handbook of Value Theory''.

{{quotation

|The concept of intrinsic value has been glossed variously as what is ''valuable for its own sake, in itself, on its own, in its own right'', as ''an end'', or ''as such''.  By contrast, extrinsic value has been characterized mainly as what is valuable as a means, or for something else's sake.}}

The assumption that humans apply two distinct criteria of judgment creates problems.  People ask, "How can we know which objects have which qualities?"  Things that "work" may appear obvious, but can stop working or have bad consequences.  Things that are "right" are not-at-all obvious and are often controversial.  This article samples usages of instrumental and intrinsic value and some disputes they generate.  Evidence is drawn from the work of four scholars.

Philosopher [[John Dewey]] and economist [[John Fagg Foster]] denied legitimacy to intrinsic value.  They treated it as contaminated application of instrumental value, and showed how instrumental value alone can judge ends and means that both work and are right.  Philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]] argued that instrumental value had itself become contaminated by inhuman industrial power unregulated by intrinsic supernatural value.  Philosopher [[Anjan Chakravartty]] argued that modern [[scientific realism]] confirms the truth of intrinsic value and the fallacy of relativistic instrumental value.

To reduce ambiguity, throughout this article the noun "value" names a criterion of judgment but not an object judged valuable.  The noun "valuation" names an object judged valuable.  The plural noun "values" identifies collections of valuations, without identifying the criterion applied.

==John Dewey==
[[John Dewey]] judged the human belief in intrinsic value to be a futile and failed search for a community [[moral compass]]. He saw no need for intrinsic value because instrumental value enables human groups to coordinate beliefs and behaviors that both work and are right.  Every social transaction has good or bad consequences depending on prevailing conditions that are satisfied or not.  Continuous reasoning adjusts patterns to keep them working on the right track as conditions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=John Dewey|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=152–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey thought that belief in intrinsic value contaminates instrumental value by isolating judgments of what is right from judgments of what works. For him, "restoring integration and cooperation between man's [[beliefs]] about the world in which he lives and his beliefs about the values [valuations] and purposes that should direct his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life."&lt;ref name="Dew 29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Quest for Certainty|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255}}  "A culture which permits science to destroy traditional values [valuations] but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Freedom and Culture|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1963|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey agreed with Max Weber that people talk as if they apply instrumental and intrinsic criteria.  And he agreed with Weber's observation that intrinsic value is problematic because it ignores the relationship between context and consequences of beliefs and behaviors.  Both men questioned how anything valued intrinsically "for its own sake" can  have operationally efficient consequences.

{{quotation
|... the more the value to which action is oriented is elevated to the status of an absolute [intrinsic] value, the more "irrational" in this [instrumental] sense the corresponding action is.  For the more unconditionally the actor devotes himself to this value for its own sake, ... the less he is influenced by considerations of the consequences of his action.&lt;ref name="Max 22"/&gt;{{rp|26, 399–400}}}}

But Dewey rejected the common belief--shared by Weber--that supernatural intrinsic value is necessary to show humans what is permanently "right."  He argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in daily life, where conditions are always changing.

{{quotation
|Man who lives in a world of hazards ... has sought to attain [security] in two ways.  One of them began with an attempt to propitiate the [intrinsic] powers which environ him and determine his destiny.  It expressed itself in supplication, sacrifice, ceremonial rite and magical cult  ....  The other course is to invent [instrumental] arts and by their means turn the powers of nature to account;...&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

{{quotation
|... for over two thousand years, the ... most influential and authoritatively orthodox tradition ... has been devoted to the problem of a purely cognitive certification (perhaps by revelation, perhaps by intuition, perhaps by reason) of the antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness.  ....  The crisis in contemporary culture, the confusions and conflicts in it, arise from a division of authority.  Scientific [instrumental] inquiry seems to tell one thing, and traditional beliefs [intrinsic valuations] about ends and ideals that have authority over conduct tell us something quite different.  ....  As long as the notion persists that knowledge is a disclosure of [intrinsic] reality ... prior to and independent of knowing, and that knowing is independent of a purpose to control the quality of experienced objects, the failure of natural science to disclose significant values [valuations] in its objects will come as a shock.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|43–4}}}}

Finding no evidence of "antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness...," Dewey argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in the continuity of human [[experience]], which always has [[Antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent]]s, and is always mutable.

{{quotation
|Dewey's ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end or supreme principle that can serve as a criterion of ethical evaluation with the goal of identifying a method for improving our value judgments.  Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is of a piece with empirical inquiry more generally.  ....  This pragmatic approach requires that we locate the conditions of warrant for our value judgments in human conduct itself, not in any ''a priori'' fixed reference point outside of conduct, such as in God's commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or "nature," considered as giving humans a fixed ''telos'' [intrinsic end].;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth|title=Dewey's Moral Philosophy|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://lplato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-moral}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|114, 172–3; 197}}}}

Philosophers label a "fixed reference point outside of conduct' a "natural kind," and presume it to have eternal existence knowable in itself without being experienced.  Natural kinds are "mind-independent" and "theory-independent" valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Tobin|first2=Emma|title=Natural Kinds|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/natural-kinds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey granted the existence of "reality" apart from human experience, but denied that it is structured as natural kinds possessing intrinsic qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|122, 196}}  Instead, he saw reality as functional continuity--ways of acting--not structural continuity of intrinsic interacting entities.  Humans may intuit static kinds and qualities, but such private experience cannot warrant inferences or valuations about mind-independent reality.  Reports or maps of any sort are never equivalent to that which is mapped.  They are fragmentary perceptions of unceasing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Tom|title=Dewey's New Logic|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1994|pages=54=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People reason daily about what they ought to do and how they ought to do it.  They discover sequences of efficient means that achieve consequences successfully.  Once an end is reached - a [[problem solving|problem solved]] - reasoning turns to what comes next in new conditions of means-end relations. Valuations and actions which ignore conditions that determine consequences cannot coordinate behavior to solve real problems.  They are [[irrational]].

{{quotation
|Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a particular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences would ensue, which would be valued.  The difference between an apparent and a real good [means or end], between an unreflectively and a reflectively valued good, is captured by its value [valuation of goodness] not just as immediately experienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and how they are valued.    ....  So viewed, value judgments are tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as scientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about the world.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;}}

In brief, Dewey rejected the traditional belief that judging things good-in-themselves, apart from existing means-end relations, can be rational.  The sole rational criterion is instrumental value.  Each successful valuation is conditional but, cumulatively, all are developmental solutions of problems.   Cumulative instrumental success provides a legitimate moral compass.  Competent instrumental valuations treat the "function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problems evoking the operations...";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Logic: the Theory of Inquiry|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|date=1938|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

==J. Fagg Foster==
[[John Fagg Foster]] refined John Dewey's rejection of intrinsic value and description of instrumental value.  He clarified differences between Dewey's instrumental criterion and the widely endorsed but faulty utilitarian alternative that turns utility into an intrinsic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Edythe|title=John Fagg Foster|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=256–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least since [[Aristotle]], scholars have reasoned that individual wants are intrinsic traits of human nature, the satisfaction of which is a legitimate end.  This belief is embodied in the criterion of utility, which holds that individuals--and groups of individuals in societies--legitimately try to maximize the sum of their want satisfactions.;&lt;ref name="Tool"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=Value Theory and Economic Progress: The Institutional Economics of J. Fagg Foster|publisher=Kluwer Academic|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|date=2007|pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utilitarians]] hold that individual wants cannot be rationally justified.  They are intrinsically worthy mental valuations and cannot be judged instrumentally.  This belief supports philosophers who hold that facts--"what is"--can serve as instrumental means for achieving wants, but cannot authorize ends--"what ought to be."  This fact-value distinction creates what philosophers label the is-ought problem: wants are intrinsically fact-free, good in themselves, while efficient tools are valuation-free, usable for good or bad ends.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  In modern North American culture, this utilitarian belief supports the [[Libertarian]] assertion that every individual's intrinsic right to satisfy  wants makes it illegitimate for anyone--but especially governments--to tell people what they ought to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|title=Anarchy, State and Utopia|publisher=Basic Books|date=1974|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster found this "is-ought" problem a useful place to attack the irrational separation of means from ends.  He started his analysis by arguing that want-satisfaction--"what ought to be"--cannot serve as an intrinsic moral compass because wants are themselves consequences of transient conditions.

{{quotation
|[T]he things people want are a function of their social experience, and that is carried on through structural institutions that specify their activities and attitudes.  Thus the pattern of people's wants takes visible form partly as a result of the pattern of the institutional structure through which they participate in the economic process.  As we have seen, to say that an economic problem exists is to say that part of the particular patterns of human relationships has ceased or failed to provide the effective participation of its members.  In so saying, we are necessarily in the position of asserting that the instrumental efficiency of the economic process is the criterion of judgment in terms of which, and only in terms of which, we may resolve economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|title=The Relation Between the Theory of Value and Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1981|pages=904–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Since wants are shaped by social conditions, they must be judged instrumentally.  Wants arise in problematic situations when habitual patterns of behavior fail to maintain instrumental correlations.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|27}}  Foster supported with homely examples his thesis that problematic situations--"what is"--contain the means for judging rationally factual ends: "what ought to be."

Consider the problem all infants face learning to walk. They spontaneously recognize that walking is more efficient than crawling--an instrumental valuation of a desirable end.  They learn to walk by repeatedly moving and balancing, judging the efficiency with which these means achieve their instrumental goal.  When they master this new way of acting, they experience great satisfaction, but satisfaction is never their end-in-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Confronting Foster's Wildest Claim: Only the Instrumental Theory of Value Can Be applied"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=2008|pages=537–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the global problem of unemployment.  Since the industrial revolution began, large groups of people have been deprived of traditional means of participation in two social functions--productive activity and income security--and of the dignity maintained by that participation.  Conditions that exclude participation--"what is"--must be replaced by new patterns of inclusion--"what ought to be."

At the end of World War II, the United States faced the threat of massive unemployment caused by demobilization.  Labor markets--the traditional utilitarian solution to unemployment--appeared unlikely to avoid that threat.  The instrumental solution was to prescribe a new pattern of correlated behavior to maintain participation: the [[G.I. Bill]], which generously subsidized education and livelihood for veterans and fostered a massive burst of innovation and economic expansion.  The instrumental moral compass of participation worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Planning Education for Economic Progress: Distinguishing Occupational Demands from Technological Possibilities"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1986|pages=1053–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|title=Diminished Democracy|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic value as either rule or reality was ignored.

Foster labeled successful applications of instrumental value "instrumental efficiency."  But he realized that efficiency by itself can contaminate reasoning by turning a dynamic process--"what ought to be"--into a static valuation--"what is."  Turning a conditionally-successful tool-use into a static self-justifying pattern of behavior is self-defeating.

To guard against this contamination of instrumental value, Foster revised his definition of its content to embrace both means and ends. INSTRUMENTAL VALUE: The criterion of judgment that seeks instrumentally-efficient means that "work" to achieve developmentally-continuous ends.  This definition stresses the condition that a successful operation must not lead down a dead-end street.  The same point is made by the currently popular concern for sustainability--a synonym for instrumental value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|year=1981|title=Syllabus for Problems of Modern Society: The Theory of Institutional Adjustment|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|pages=929–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's and Foster's arguments that instrumental value is the proper criterion for judging both means and ends continue to be ignored rather than refuted.  Scholars continue to accept the possibility and necessity of knowing intrinsic value--"what ought to be"--independently of transient conditions that determine actual consequences of every action.  Jacques Ellul and Anjan Chakravartty were prominent exponents of popular arguments for the reality of intrinsic value as moral compass and as constraint on relativistic instrumental value.

==Jacques Ellul==
[[Jacques Ellul]] made scholarly contributions to many fields, but his American reputation grew out of his criticism of the autonomous authority of instrumental value, the criterion that Dewey and Foster found to be the core of human rationality.  And he specifically criticized the valuations central to Dewey's and Foster's thesis: evolving instrumental technology.

His principal work, published in 1954, bore the French title ''La technique.''  It addressed the problem Dewey addressed in 1929: a culture in which the authority of evolving technology destroys traditional valuations without creating legitimate new ones.  Both men agreed that conditionally efficient valuations--"what is"--become irrational when viewed as unconditionally efficient in themselves--"what ought to be."  But while Dewey argued that contaminated instrumental valuations can be self-correcting, Ellul concluded that technology had become intrinsically destructive.  The only escape from this evil is to restore authority to unconditional sacred valuations:

{{quotation
|Nothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or the supernatural.  The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very well that there is nothing spiritual anywhere.  But man cannot live without the [intrinsic] sacred.  He therefore transfers his sense of the sacred to the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to technique itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Society|publisher=Knopf|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}}}}

''La technique'' was published in English in 1964 with the title ''The Technological Society'', and quickly entered ongoing disputes in the United States over the responsibility of instrumental value for destructive social consequences.  The translator of ''Technological Society'' summarized Ellul's thesis:

{{quotation
|''Technological Society'' is a description of the way in which an autonomous [instrumental] technology is in process of taking over the traditional values [intrinsic valuations] of every society without exception, subverting and suppressing those values to produce at last a monolithic world culture in which all non-technological difference and variety is mere appearance.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|v-vi, x}}}}

Ellul opened ''The Technological Society'' by asserting that instrumental efficiency is no longer a conditional criterion.  It has become autonomous and absolute.

{{quotation
|The term ''technique'', as I use it, does not mean machines, technology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end.  In our technological society, technique is the ''totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency'' (for a given stage of development) in ''every'' field of human activity.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|xxxvi}}}}

He accused instrumental judgment of destroying intrinsic meanings of human life.  "Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature.  Life in such an environment has no meaning.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}  Weber had labeled the discrediting of intrinsic valuations "disenchantment;" Ellul came to label it "terrorism."&lt;ref name="Ell 90"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Bluff|publisher=William B. Erdmans|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|384, 19}}  He dated its domination to the 1800s, when centuries-old handicraft techniques were massively eliminated by inhuman industry.

{{quotation
|When, in the 19th century, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind had been violated.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|73}}}}

{{quotation
|Culture is necessarily humanistic or it does not exist at all.  ....  [I]t answers questions about the meaning of life, the possibility of reunion with ultimate being, the attempt to overcome human finitude, and all other questions that they have to ask and handle.  But technique cannot deal with such things.  ....  Culture exists only if it raises the question of meaning and values [valuations].  ....  Technique is not at all concerned about the meaning of life, and it rejects any relation to values [intrinsic valuations].&lt;ref name="Ell 90"/&gt;{{rp|147–8}}}}

Ellul's core accusation was that instrumental efficiency had become absolute--a good-in-itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|83}}  It wraps societies in a new technological milieu with six intrinsically inhuman characteristics:

{{quotation
|a) It is artificial; b) it is autonomous with respect to values [valuations], ideas, and the state; c) It is ... self-determinative independently of all human intervention; d) It grows according to a process which is causal but not directed to ends; e) It is formed by an accumulation of means which have established primacy over ends; f) All its parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that it is impossible to separate them or to settle any technical problems in isolation.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22}}}}

Tiles and Oberdiek found Ellul's characterization of instrumental efficiency inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22–31}}  They criticized him for anthropomorphizing and demonizing instrumental value.  They countered by examining the moral reasoning of scientists whose work led to nuclear weapons.  Those scientists demonstrated the capacity of instrumental judgments to provide them with a moral compass to judge nuclear technology with conscience and responsibility, with no need for intrinsic rules.  Tiles's and Oberdiek's conclusion coincided with that of Dewey and Foster: instrumental value, when competently applied, is self-correcting and provides humans with a developmental moral compass.

{{quotation
|For although we have defended general principles of the moral responsibilities of professional people, it would be foolish and wrongheaded to suggest codified [intrinsic] rules.  It would be foolish because concrete cases are more complex and nuanced than any code could capture; it would be wrongheaded because it would suggest that our sense of moral responsibility can be fully captured by a code.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|193}}}}

{{quotation
|In fact, as we have seen in many instances, technology simply allows us to go on doing stupid things in clever ways.  The questions that technology cannot solve, although it will always frame and condition the answers, are "What should we be trying to do? What kind of lives should we, as human beings, be seeking to live?  And can this kind of life be pursued without exploiting others?   But until we can at least propose [instrumental] answers to those questions we cannot really begin to do sensible things in the clever ways that technology might permit.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|197}}}}

==Anjan Chakravartty&lt;!--'Semi-realism' and 'Semirealism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|Selective realism}}
[[Anjan Chakravartty]] came indirectly to question the autonomous authority of instrumental value.  He viewed it as a foil for the currently dominant philosophical school labeled "[[scientific realism]]," with which he identifies.  In 2007, he published a work defending the ultimate authority of intrinsic valuations to which realists are committed.  He linked the pragmatic instrumental criterion to discredited anti-realist empiricist schools including [[logical positivism]] and [[instrumentalism]]

Chakravartty began his study with rough characterizations of realist and anti-realist valuations of theories.  Anti-realists believe "that theories are merely instruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing observation reports."  They assert that theories can never report or prescribe truth or reality "in itself."  By contrast, scientific realists believe that theories can "correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Chak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakravartty|first=Anjan|title=A Metaphysics for Scientific Realism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi, 10}}  Well-confirmed theories--"what ought to be" as the end of reasoning--are more than tools.  They are mappings of intrinsic properties of an unobservable and unconditional territory--"what is" as natural but metaphysical real kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|xiii, 33, 149}}

Chakravartty treated value-in-general as ungrounded opinion,&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|25}} but admitted that realists value how well theories "work"--the instrumental criterion.  He qualified that criterion's scope, claiming that every instrumental judgment is inductive, heuristic, accidental.  Later experience might confirm a singular judgment only if it proves to have universal validity, meaning it possesses "detection properties" of natural kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|231}}  This inference is his fundamental ground for believing in intrinsic value.

He committed modern realists to three metaphysical valuations or intrinsic kinds of knowledge of truth.  Competent realists affirm that natural kinds 1) exist in a mind-independent territory possessing 2) meaningful and 3) mappable intrinsic properties.

{{quotation
|Ontologically, scientific realism is committed to the existence of a mind-independent world or reality.  A realist semantics implies that the theoretical claims [valuations] about this reality have truth values, and should be construed literally ...  Finally, the epistemological commitment is to the idea that these theoretical claims give us knowledge of the world.  That is, predictively successful (mature, non-ad hoc) theories, taken literally as describing the nature of a mind-independent reality are (approximately) true.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|9}}}}

He labeled these intrinsic valuations semirealist, meaning they are currently the most accurate theoretical descriptions of mind-independent natural kinds.  He found these carefully qualified statements necessary to replace earlier realist descriptions discredited by advancing instrumental valuations.

Science has destroyed for many people the supernatural intrinsic value embraced by Weber and Ellul.  But Chakravartty defended natural intrinsic valuations as necessary elements of all science--belief in unobservable continuities.  He advanced the thesis of '''semirealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which well-tested theories are good maps of natural kinds, as confirmed by their instrumental success.  Their predictive success means they conform to mind-independent, unconditional reality.

{{quotation
|Scientific theories describe causal properties, concrete structures, and particulars such as objects, events, and processes.  Semirealism maintains that under certain conditions it is reasonable for realists to believe that the best of these descriptions tell us not merely about things that can be experienced with the unaided senses, but also about some of the unobservable things underlying them.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|Causal properties are the fulcrum of semirealism.  Their [intrinsic] relations compose the concrete structures that are the primary subject matters of a tenable scientific realism.  They regularly cohere to form interesting units, and these groupings make up the particulars investigated by the sciences and described by scientific theories.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|119}}}}

Chakravartty argued that these semirealist valuations authorize scientific theorizing about pragmatic kinds, as scientists search for natural kinds.  The fact that theoretical kinds are frequently replaced does not mean that mind-independent reality is changing, but simply that theoretical maps are approximating intrinsic reality.

{{quotation
|The primary motivation for thinking that there are such things as natural kinds is the idea that carving nature according to its own divisions yields groups of objects that are capable of supporting successful inductive generalizations and prediction.  So the story goes, one's recognition of natural categories facilitates these practices, and thus furnishes an excellent explanation for their success.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|The moral here is that however realists choose to construct particulars out of instances of properties, they do so on the basis of a belief in the [mind-independent] existence of those properties.  That is the bedrock of realism.  Property instances lend themselves to different forms of packaging [instrumental valuations], but as a feature of scientific description, this does not compromise realism with respect to the relevant [intrinsic] packages.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|81}}}}

In sum, Chakravartty argued that contingent instrumental valuations are warranted only as they approximate unchanging intrinsic valuations.  Scholars continue to perfect their explanations of  intrinsic value, as they deny the developmental continuity of applications of instrumental value.

{{quotation
|Abstraction is a process in which only some of the potentially many relevant factors present in [unobservable] reality are represented in a model or description with some aspect of the world, such as the nature or behavior of a specific object or process.  ... Pragmatic constraints such as these play a role in shaping how scientific investigations are conducted, and together which and how many potentially relevant factors [intrinsic kinds] are incorporated into models and descriptions during the process of abstraction.  The role of pragmatic constraints, however, does not undermine the idea that putative representations of factors composing abstract models can be thought to have counterparts in the [mind-independent] world.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|191}}}}

Realist intrinsic value, such as proposed by Chakravartty, is widely endorsed in modern scientific circles, while the supernatural intrinsic value endorsed by Weber and Ellul maintains its popularity throughout the world.  Doubters about the reality of instrumental and intrinsic value are few.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[closed monoidal category|symmetric monoidal closed category]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a small category enriched in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Isbell conjugacy''' is an [[Adjunction (category theory)|adjunction]] between the categories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}^{\mathcal{A}^{op}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{V}^{\mathcal{A}})^{op}&lt;/math&gt; arising from the [[Yoneda embedding]] &lt;math&gt;Y:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}^{\mathcal{A}^{op}}&lt;/math&gt; and the dual Yoneda embedding &lt;math&gt;Z:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow(\mathcal{V}^{\mathcal{A}})^{op}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Kinesthetic learning''' (American English), '''kinaesthetic learning''' (British English), or '''tactile learning''' is a [[learning style]] in which [[learning]] takes place by the students carrying out physical activities, rather than listening to a lecture or watching demonstrations. As cited by Favre (2009), Dunn and Dunn define kinesthetic learners as students who require whole-body movement to process new and difficult information.&lt;ref&gt;Favre, L. R. (2009). Kinesthetic Instructional Strategies: Moving At-Risk Learners to Higher Levels. Insights on Learning Disabilities, 6(1), 29-35.

==History==
Kinesthetic intelligence, which was originally coupled with tactile abilities, was defined and discussed in Howard Gardner's ''[[Frames Of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]'' in 1983. In this book, Gardner describes activities such as dancing and performing surgery as requiring great kinesthetic intelligence: using the body to create (or do) something.

[[Margaret H'Doubler]] wrote and spoke about kinesthetic learning during the 1940s, defining kinesthetic learning as the human body's ability to express itself through movement and dance.

===The VARK model===
Neil Fleming, a New Zealand teacher and educational theorist, designed the VARK model (visual, aural or auditory, read/write and kinesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;Kte’pi, B. M. (2016). VARK model. Salem Press Encyclopedia, 1-4. Retrieved from http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=9c230f56-1b84-4d47-a439-c2ae572d551d%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=113931235&amp;db=ers&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fleming’s model, kinesthetic learners are similar to tactile learners in that they like hands-on experiential learning. They excel in concrete learning such as on-the-job training, work experience, internships, simulations and so forth (Kte’pi, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Kte’pi, B. M. (2016). VARK model. Salem Press Encyclopedia, 1-4. Retrieved from http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=9c230f56-1b84-4d47-a439-c2ae572d551d%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=113931235&amp;db=ers&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Learning styles#Neil Fleming.27s VAK.2FVARK model|Fleming VAK/VARK model]] (one of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles)&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2.  SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; categorized learning styles as follows:
* [[Hands-on learning]]
* [[Visual learning]]
* [[Auditory learning]]
* Read/write learning
* Kinesthetic learning
Skill memory also fits into the category of kinesthetic learning, as it is what happens when somebody is learning kinesthetically. Skill memories are difficult to convey except by direct demonstration, may be acquired without awareness, and require several repetitions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior|last=Gluck|first=M.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Rita Dunn contends that kinesthetic and tactile learning are the same style.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Rita.  2009. Title: Impact of Learning-Style Instructional Strategies on Students' Achievement and Attitudes: Perceptions of Educators in Diverse Institutions.&lt;/ref&gt; Galeet BenZion asserts that kinesthetic and tactile learning are separate learning styles, with different characteristics. She defined kinesthetic learning as the process that results in new knowledge (or understanding) with the involvement of the learner's body movement. This movement is performed to establish new knowledge or extend existing knowledge. Kinesthetic learning is at its best, BenZion found, when the learner uses language (their own words) in order to define, explain, resolve and sort out how their body's movement reflects the concept explored. One example is a student using movement to work out the sum of 1/2 plus 3/4 via movement, then explaining how their motions in space reflect the mathematical process leading to the correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;BenZion(Westreich), Galeet.  1999.  An analysis of kinesthetic learners' responses: teaching mathematics through dance.  Doctoral Dissertation.  American University, Washington D.C..&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Denig (2004) in his article ‘Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions’, presented Dunn and Dunn’s Learning Styles Model, which addresses 21 elements that affect students’ learning. These elements are broken down into five stimuli: environmental, emotional, sociological, physiological and psychological variables. Under this model, physiological stimuli consist of four elements, one of which is perceptual. Perceptual depicts the auditory, visual, tactual and kinesthetic styles whereby learners learn more effectively. This gives meaning to the concept that kinesthetic learners learn best through whole-body activities and experiences while tactual learners learn best through manipulation of items with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Denig, S. J. (2004). Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions. Teachers College Record, 106(1), 96-111. Retrieved from https://journals-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.brocku.ca/pdf/01614681/v106i0001/96_mialstcd.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinesthetic memory==
Depending upon [[Mnemonic|memory systems]] the kinesthetic learners respond differently. The different kinds of learners mainly include whole body learners, hands-on learners, doodlers, students learning through emotional experiences. The learning and the memory is generally short term. To achieve a long term memory different techniques can be used depending on the learning style. Mind mapping, story mapping, webbing, drawing can be used to enhance the learning of a doodler.  For the hands-on learner, role play, clay, building and math manipulative can be used. The whole book body learner can learn better through role-playing, body mapping, puzzles and use of computer technology which allows for certain movement while learning. Students can be engaged in group activities and activities which involve bodily movement such as dance, drama, sports can be used to nurture their learning. The following strategies can be used to facilitate kinesthetic memory through procedural motor pathway such as:
* [[Dance]]: ideas, concepts and processes can be expressed through creative movements
* Laboratory demonstrations
* [[Sport]]s
* [[Gymnastics]]
* [[Charades]]
The kinesthetic learners who have memories associated with [[emotion]]s learning can be facilitated through dance, [[debate]], [[drama]], [[Role-playing|role-play]], and charades. This kind of learning leads to a [[long-term memory]] since it is associated with emotions such as [[wikt:excitement|excitement]], [[curiosity]], [[anger]], [[disappointment]] and success.&lt;ref name="Sprenger2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilee Sprenger|title=Differentiation Through Learning Styles and Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaVu2p5uDBkC&amp;pg=PA113|date=22 April 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-9504-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds of skill memory ==
Perceptual-motor skills are skills learned by movement patterns guided by sensory inputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are closed skills and open skills. Closed skills are skills learned such as dance.  A ballerina learns a specific set of moves and doesn’t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option.  Open skills are skills that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports.  A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can't know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open skills are required to become successful.  Cognitive skills also are a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories.  Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well.  Cognitive skills are skills which require individuals to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move their bodies based on what they perceive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Solving a puzzle would be an example of a cognitive skill.

==Management strategies==
Learners with kinesthetic preferences learn through active movements and [[experience]]s. Activities such as [[Play (activity)|playing]], [[puppetry]], [[drama]], [[acting]] and [[design]]ing ensures involvement of the learners. Thus, it is also important to manage the students during such activities.&lt;ref name="SimsSims1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald R. Sims|author2=Serbrenia J. Sims|title=The Importance of Learning Styles: Understanding the Implications for Learning, Course Design, and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECi3gFMEvh8C&amp;pg=PA53|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29278-1|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some effective [[Strategy|strategies]] used to involve unmotivated students during activities are:
* Motivate the students by giving attention and [[Reward management|reward]], avoid [[punishment]].
* Students should be provided with option to choose activities for learning a particular concept
* Grades can be allotted depending on the participation by using score rubrics
* Activities chosen should encourage all the students to succeed and feel that have accomplished [[learning]] through an activity
* Every student has to be given equal opportunity to participate
* Cooperative activities can be organized and positive feedback can be given to encourage [[teamwork]] in a class
Some effective strategies used to manage hyper motivated students are:
* Encourage the students to organize body movement during activities
* Regular monitoring of the students 
* Appropriate and accurate directions have to be given for any activity
* Before involving the students in the activity, the consequences of the task going out of control has to be clearly explained.&lt;ref name="LengelKuczala2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Traci Lengel|author2=Mike Kuczala|title=The Kinesthetic Classroom: Teaching and Learning Through Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUA4zKBlsrsC|date=26 January 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-7120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinesthetic Learners in the Classroom===

Subjects can be taught to cater for kinesthetic learners. Through a strength-based and learner-centered approach, educators should engage kinesthetic students in activities that require movements because they learn by doing. Activities could include role-plays, drama, dance, races and competitions, field trips and projects.

Favre (2009) stated that instructional strategies should include movement in a game-like format. Favre suggested designing kinesthetic games. For example, “game boards such as Tic-Tac-Toe affixed to the classroom floor and hopscotch template painted on the playground tarmac or sidewalks around the school” (p. 32). Favre also suggested that instructors can use “commercial games such as Twister, Jeopardy and Nerf basketball and create game cards that align with their lesson objectives” (pp.32-33) &lt;ref&gt;Favre, L. R. (2009, March 1). Kinesthetic Instructional Strategies: Moving At-Risk Learners to Higher Levels. Insights on Learning Disabilities, 6(1), 29-35. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Reese &amp; Dunn (2007) in their research of college freshmen learning styles provided recommended that "to ensure success for kinesthetic learners, classes should provide active experiences for planning or carrying out objectives, such as visits, project, role playing, simulations and floor or wall games"(p. 108). &lt;ref&gt;Reese, V. L., &amp; Dunn, R. (2007). Learning-Style Preferences of a Diverse Freshmen Population in a Large, Private, Metropolitan University by Gender and GPA. Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice, 9(1), 95-112. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of evidence==
Although the concept of [[learning styles]] is popular among educators in some countries (and children and adults express preferences for particular modes of learning), there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes; on the contrary, there is substantial evidence that the meshing hypothesis (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name=Pashler&gt;{{cite journal

Proponents state that the evidence related to kinesthetic learners benefiting from specialized instruction (or targeted materials) appears mixed at best; the [[diagnosis]] of kinesthetic and tactile learning is coupled (rather than isolated), and teachers are likely to misdiagnose students' learning styles.

On the other hand, studies do show that mixed-modality presentations (for instance, using auditory and visual techniques) improve results in a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name=Coffield&gt;Coffield, F., Moseley, D., Hall, E., Ecclestone, K.

London: Learning and Skills Research Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Instruction that stimulates more than auditory learning (for example, kinesthetic learning) is more likely to enhance learning in a heterogeneous student population.&lt;ref&gt;BenZion, Galeet (2010).

University of Maryland at College Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain substrates involved ==
There are three parts of the brain that are the most important to kinesthetic and skill learning.  The [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebral cortex]], and the [[cerebellum]] all play equally important roles in the ability to learn new skills and master them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience: A Brain-Mind Odyssey|last=Presti|first=D.|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basal ganglia are a collection of ganglia (clusters of neurons) that lie at the base of the forebrain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   The basal ganglia receive information from other parts of the brain such as the hippocampus and cortical areas that send messages about the outside world.  Most of these messages are sensory, meaning what a person is physically feeling.  The basal ganglia then interpret this information and sends it on a path to the thalamus and the brainstem which both play large factors in physical movement. Therefore, the basal ganglia are the beginning of the process for somebody who is learning-by-doing to respond viscerally to the stimuli around them.  It is important once a skill is learned to practice it.  This can change how basal ganglia circuits participate in the performance of that skill and that synaptic plasticity is a basic neural mechanism enabling such changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The more a person practices, the more plasticity they develop.

The cerebral cortex is the brain tissue covering the top and sides of the brain in most vertebrates. It is involved in storing and processing of sensory inputs and motor outputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the human brain, the cerebral cortex is actually a sheet of neural tissue about 1/8th inch thick.  The sheet is folded so that it can fit inside the skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The neural circuits in this area of the brain expand with practice of an activity, just like the synaptic plasticity grows with practice.  Clarification of some of the mechanisms of learning by neuro science has been advanced, in part, by the advent of non-invasive imaging technologies, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (FMRI). These technologies have allowed researchers to observe human learning processes directly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How People Learn: Brian, mind, Experience and School|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these types of technologies, we are now able to see and study what happens in the process of learning.  In different tests performed the brain being imaged showed a greater blood flow and activation to that area of the brain being stimulated through different activities such as finger tapping in a specific sequence.  It has been revealed that the process at the beginning of learning a new skill happens quickly, and later on slows down to almost a plateau.  This process can also be referred to as The Law of Learning.  The slower learning showed in the FMRI that in the cerebral cortex this was when the long term learning was occurring, suggesting that the structural changes in the cortex reflect the enhancement of skill memories during later stages of training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   When a person studies a skill for a longer duration of time, but in a shorter amount of time they will learn quickly, but also only retain the information into their [[short-term memory]].  Just like studying for an exam; if a student tries to learn everything the night before, it will not stick in the long run.  If a person studies a skill for a shorter duration of time, but more frequently and long-term, their brain will retain this information much longer as it is stored in the [[long-term memory]].  Functional and structural studies of the brain have revealed a vast interconnectivity between diverse regions of the cerebral cortex.  For example, large numbers of axons interconnect the posterior sensory areas serving vision, audition, and touch with anterior motor regions.  Constant communication between sensation and movement makes sense, because to execute smooth movement through the environment, movement must be continuously integrated with knowledge about one's surroundings obtained via sensory perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The cerebral cortex plays a role in allowing humans to do this.

The cerebellum is critical to the ability for a human or animal to be able to regulate movement.  This area of the brain wraps around the brainstem and is very densely packed with neurons and neural connections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This part of the brain is involved in timing as well as movement.  It assists in predicting events, especially in the formation, execution, and timing of conditioned responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The cerebellum plays a very important role in all forms of kinesthetic learning and motor function.  For a ballerina, it is important to be able to control their movements and time it exactly right for their routine.  For a football player it is important to be able to regulate movement when running throwing, and being able to have control over where the ball goes as well as the timing of it.

All three of these important systems in the brain function together as a team, one not being more important than the other.  They work together to allow for responding to sensory events, timing, controlling physical actions, and more.  However, it is important to remember than unless a person is actively practicing, these parts of the brain won't help them get to their full potential. Alterations in the brain that occur during learning seem to make the nerve cells more efficient or powerful. Studies have shown that animals raised in complex environments have a greater volume of capillaries per nerve cell—and therefore a greater supply of blood to the brain—than the caged animals, regardless of whether the caged animal lived alone or with companions. Overall, these studies depict an orchestrated pattern of increased capacity in the brain that depends on experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''language death''' occurs when a [[language]] loses its [[terminal speaker|last]] [[First language|native speaker]]. By extension, '''language extinction''' is when the language is no longer known, including by [[Second language|second-language]] speakers. Other similar terms include '''linguicide''',&lt;ref name="Stop, revive and survive"&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the death of a language from natural or political causes, and rarely '''glottophagy''',&lt;ref&gt;Calvet, Jean-Louis. 1974. ''Langue et colonialisme: petit traité de glottophagie.'' Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; the absorption or replacement of a minor language by a major language.

Language death is a process in which the level of a [[Speech community|speech community's]] [[linguistic competence]] in their [[Variety (linguistics)|language variety]] decreases, eventually resulting in no native or fluent speakers of the variety. Language death can affect any language form, including [[dialect]]s. Language death should not be confused with [[language attrition]] (also called language loss), which describes the loss of proficiency in a [[first language]] of an individual.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000"&gt;Crystal, David (2000) ''Language Death''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern period]] (c. 1500 CE–present; following the rise of [[colonialism]]), language death has typically resulted from the process of [[cultural assimilation]] leading to [[language shift]] and the gradual abandonment of a native language in favour of a foreign ''[[lingua franca]]'', largely those of [[European colonialism|European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XxZbhSsqnUQC&amp;pg=PT739|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|last=Byram|first=Michael|last2=Hu|first2=Adelheid|date=2013-06-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136235531|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HecNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|title=Living Through Languages: An African Tribute to René Dirven|last=Walt|first=Christa Van der|date=2007-05-01|publisher=AFRICAN SUN MeDIA|isbn=9781920109707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sq5pdj2snokC&amp;pg=PA115|title=Mapping Applied Linguistics: A Guide for Students and Practitioners|last=Hall|first=Christopher J.|last2=Smith|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Wicaksono|first3=Rachel|date=2015-05-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136836233|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2000s, a total of roughly 7,000 natively spoken languages existed worldwide. Most of these are minor languages in danger of extinction; one estimate published in 2004 expected that some 90% of the currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4387421/|title=Study by language researcher, David Graddol|date=2004-02-26|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2012-03-22}} {{cite web|url=http://www.chinasmack.com/stories/90-percent-worlds-languages-extinct-in-41-years/|title=Research by Southwest University for Nationalities College of Liberal Arts|author=Ian on Friday, January 16, 2009 61 comments|date=2009-01-16|publisher=Chinasmack.com|accessdate=2012-03-22}}.

==Types==

Language death is typically the final outcome of [[language shift]] and may manifest itself in one of the following ways:
* Gradual language death: slowly, over a period of time
* Bottom-to-top language death: cessation of the use of language except in special circumstances (e.g. liturgical language) 
* Top-to-bottom language death: when language shift begins in a high-level environment such as the government.
* Radical language death: The disappearance of a language when all speakers of the language cease to speak the language
* Linguicide (also known as sudden death, language genocide, physical language death, biological language death)
* Language attrition: the loss of proficiency in a language at the individual level

The most common process leading to language death is one in which a community of speakers of one [[language]] becomes [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] with another language, and gradually [[Language shift|shifts]] allegiance to the second language until they cease to use their original, [[heritage language]]. This is a process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] which may be voluntary or may be forced upon a population. Speakers of some languages, particularly regional or minority languages, may decide to abandon them based on economic or utilitarian grounds, in favor of languages regarded as having greater utility or prestige.

Languages with a small, geographically isolated population of speakers can die when their speakers are wiped out by [[genocide]], [[disease]], or [[natural disaster]].

== Definition==
A language is often declared to be dead even before the last native speaker of the language has died. If there are only a few elderly speakers of a language remaining, and they no longer use that language for communication, then the language is effectively dead. A language that has reached such a reduced stage of use is generally considered moribund.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000"/&gt; Half of the spoken languages of the world are not being taught to new generations of children.&lt;ref name="Crystal, David 2000" /&gt; Once a language is no longer a native language—that is, if no children are being socialized into it as their primary language—the process of transmission is ended and the language itself will not survive past the current generations.

Language death is rarely a sudden event, but a slow process of each generation learning less and less of the language, until its use is relegated to the domain of traditional use, such as in poetry and song. Typically the transmission of the language from adults to children becomes more and more restricted, to the final setting that adults speaking the language will raise children who never acquire fluency. One example of this process reaching its conclusion is that of the [[Dalmatian language]].

==Consequences on grammar==
During language loss—sometimes referred to as ''obsolescence'' in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to. This process of change has been described by Appel (1983) in two categories, though they are not mutually exclusive. Often speakers replace elements of their own language with something from the language they are shifting toward. Also, if their heritage language has an element that the new language does not, speakers may drop it.

* analogical leveling.

==Language revitalization==
{{Main|Language revitalization}}
Language revitalization is an attempt to slow or reverse language death. Revitalization programs are ongoing in many languages, and have had varying degrees of success.

The [[revival of the Hebrew language]] in [[Israel]] is the only example of a language's acquiring new [[first language]] speakers after it became extinct in everyday use for an extended period, being used only as a [[liturgical language]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, Leanne; &amp; Hale, Ken (eds.). 2001. ''The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice''. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the case of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], there is a theory that argues that "the Hebrew revivalists who wished to speak pure Hebrew failed. The result is a fascinating and multifaceted Israeli language, which is not only multi-layered but also multi-sourced. The revival of a clinically dead language is unlikely without cross-fertilization from the revivalists' mother tongue(s)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html "Aboriginal languages deserve revival"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923233756/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25980525-25192,00.html |date=2009-09-23 }}, ''The Australian Higher Education'', August 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases of language revitalization which have seen some degree of success are [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]  and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As a response to English linguistic dominance, [[Anglicization#Place names|de-anglicisation]] became a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under [[colonialism|colonial]] rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject.&lt;ref name=ALD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html|title=The Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland|first=Douglas|last=Hyde|date=25 November 1892|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= De-Anglicization - Free Online Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/de-anglicization| publisher= |accessdate= | quote=the elimination of English influence, language, customs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following centuries of [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English rule in Ireland]] and English imposition of the English language, an argument for de-anglicization was delivered before the [[National Literary Society|Irish National Literary Society]] in Dublin, 25 November 1892; "When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English."&lt;ref name=ALD/&gt; Language was one of the features of Anglicisation in Ireland: although it never died out and became an [[official language]] after independence, Irish had lost its status as the island's principal vernacular to become a minority language during the period of English rule; similarly, in North America [[indigenous language]]s have been replaced by those of the colonists.

According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "language reclamation will become increasingly relevant as people seek to recover their cultural autonomy, empower their spiritual and intellectual sovereignty, and improve wellbeing. There are various ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian benefits of language revival—for example, historical justice, diversity and employability, respectively."&lt;ref name="Stop, revive and survive"/&gt;

== Factors that prevent language death ==
Google launched the Endangered Languages Project aimed at helping preserve languages that are at risk of extinction. Its goal is to compile up-to-date information about endangered languages and share the latest research about them.

Anthropologist Akira Yamamoto has identified nine factors that he believes will help prevent language death:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKHjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191|title=Language Death|last=Crystal|first=David|date=2014-11-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781316124093|location=|pages=191|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There must be a dominant culture that favors linguistic diversity
# The endangered community must possess an ethnic identity that is strong enough to encourage language preservation
# The creation and promotion of programs that educate students on the endangered language and culture
# The creation of school programs that are both bilingual and bicultural
# For native speakers to receive teacher training
# The endangered speech community must be completely involved 
# There must be language materials created that are easy to use
# The language must have written materials that encompass new and traditional content
# The language must be used in new environments and the areas the language is used (both old and new) must be strengthened

==Dead languages ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
Linguists distinguish between language "death" and the process where a language becomes a "dead language" through normal [[language change]], a linguistic phenomenon analogous to [[pseudoextinction]]. This happens when a language in the course of its normal development gradually morphs into something that is then recognized as a separate, different language, leaving the old form with no native speakers. Thus, for example, [[Old English]] may be regarded as a "dead language" although it changed and developed into [[Middle English]], [[Early Modern English]] and [[Modern English]]. Dialects of a language can also die, contributing to the overall language death. For example, the Ainu language is slowly dying - "The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger lists Hokkaido Ainu as critically endangered with 15 speakers ... and both Sakhalin and Kuril Ainu as extinct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Länsisalmi|first1=Riikka|title=NORTHERN VOICES: EXAMINING LANGUAGE ATTITUDES IN RECENT SURVEYS ON AINU AND SAAMI|journal=Studia Orientalia Electronica|date=October 2016|volume=117|pages=429-267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language change ==
The process of language change may also involve the splitting up of a language into a family of several [[daughter language]]s, leaving the common parent language "dead". This has happened to [[Latin]], which (through [[Vulgar Latin]]) eventually developed into the [[Romance languages]], and to [[Prakrit]], which developed into the [[Indo-Aryan languages#New Indo-Aryan|New Indo-Aryan languages]]. Such a process is normally not described as "language death", because it involves an unbroken chain of normal transmission of the language from one generation to the next, with only minute changes at every single point in the chain. Thus with regard to Latin, for example, there is no point at which Latin "died"; it evolved in different ways in different geographic areas, and its modern forms are now identified by a plethora of different names such as French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Catalan, Galician, Venetian, etc.

==Measuring language vitality==
Except in case of linguicide, languages do not suddenly become extinct; they become moribund as the community of speakers gradually [[Language shift|shifts]] to using other languages. As speakers shift, there are discernible, if subtle, changes in language behavior. These changes in behavior lead to a change of linguistic vitality in the community.  There are a variety of systems that have been proposed for measuring the vitality of a language in a community. One of the earliest is GIDS (Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) proposed by [[Joshua Fishman]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Joshua. 1991. ''Reversing Language Shift''. Clevendon: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; A noteworthy publishing milestone in measuring language vitality is an entire issue of ''[[Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development]]'' devoted to the study of ethnolinguistic vitality, Vol. 32.2, 2011, with several authors presenting their own tools for measuring language vitality. A number of other published works on measuring language vitality have been published, prepared by authors with varying situations and applications in mind. These include works by [[Arienne Dwyer]],&lt;ref name=Dwyer2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Arienne M. |title=Tools and techniques for endangered-language assessment and revitalization |url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/7109/1/Dwyer2011_AssessRevitalize.pdf |date=October 23–24, 2009 |location=New York |journal=Trace  Foundation Lecture Series Proceedings: Preprint |format=PDF |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Ehala,&lt;ref&gt;Ehala, Martin. 2009.

'''Mabel Elsworth Todd''' (1880 &amp;ndash; 1956) is known as the founder of what came to be known as '[[Ideokinesis]]', a form of [[somatics|somatic education]] that became popular in the 1930s amongst dancers and health professionals. Todd's ideas involved using anatomically based, creative visual imagery and consciously relaxed volition to create refine neuromuscular coordination. Lulu Sweigard, who coined the term Ideokinesis, and Barbara Clark furthered Todd's work.&lt;ref name='grinfeld'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/~t656_web/Spring_2002_students/grinfeld_julie_ideokinesis.htm |title='The Idea of Ideokinesis' |accessdate=2007-01-10 |author=Julie Grinfeld |year=2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213011617/http://www.gse.harvard.edu/~t656_web/Spring_2002_students/grinfeld_julie_ideokinesis.htm |archivedate=2006-12-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Franklin, Eric. | title='Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery' | year=1996 | publisher=Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics | isbn=0-87322-475-2 | page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd's work was published in her book 'The Thinking Body' (1937), which is now considered by modern dance schools to be a classic study of [[physiology]] and the psychology of movement.  Her work influenced many somatic awareness professionals of her day, and is often cited along with The [[Feldenkrais method]] for its focus on the subtle influence of unconscious [[intention]] and attention.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon in the garden of Villon's studio, Puteaux, France, c.1913.jpg|thumb|230px|Three Duchamp brothers, left to right: Marcel Duchamp, [[Jacques Villon]], and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] in the garden of Jacques Villon's studio in Puteaux, France, 1914, ([[Smithsonian Institution]] collections)]]
Marcel Duchamp was born at [[Blainville-Crevon]] in [[Normandy]], France, and grew up in a family that enjoyed cultural activities. The art of painter and engraver {{Interlanguage link multi|Émile Frédéric Nicolle|fr}}, his maternal grandfather, filled the house, and the family liked to play chess, read books, paint, and make music together.

Of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp's seven children, one died as an infant and four became successful artists. Marcel Duchamp was the brother of:
* [[Jacques Villon]] (1875–1963), painter, printmaker
* [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876–1918), sculptor
* [[Suzanne Duchamp|Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti]] (1889–1963), painter.

As a child, with his two elder brothers already away from home at school in [[Rouen]], Duchamp was closer to his sister Suzanne, who was a willing accomplice in games and activities conjured by his fertile imagination. At eight years old, Duchamp followed in his brothers' footsteps when he left home and began schooling at the [[Lycée Pierre-Corneille]], in Rouen. Two other students in his class also became well-known artists and lasting friends: [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]] and [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Pessiot, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2v3xkP3ekEC&amp;pg=PA271 ''Histoire de Rouen'' volume 2 ''1900–1939 en 800 photographies''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122200759/https://books.google.com/books?id=u2v3xkP3ekEC&amp;pg=PA271 |date=22 January 2017 }}, repr. Rouen: PTC, 2004, {{ISBN|9782906258877}}, p. 271 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next eight years, he was locked into an educational regime which focused on intellectual development. Though he was not an outstanding student, his best subject was mathematics and he won two mathematics prizes at the school. He also won a prize for drawing in 1903, and at his commencement in 1904 he won a coveted first prize, validating his recent decision to become an artist.

He learned academic drawing from a teacher who unsuccessfully attempted to "protect" his students from [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], and other [[avant-garde]] influences. However, Duchamp's true artistic mentor at the time was his brother Jacques Villon, whose fluid and incisive style he sought to imitate. At 14, his first serious art attempts were drawings and watercolors depicting his sister Suzanne in various poses and activities. That summer he also painted landscapes in an Impressionist style using oils.

==Early work==
Duchamp's early art works align with [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] styles. He experimented with classical techniques and subjects. When he was later asked about what had influenced him at the time, Duchamp cited the work of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painter]] [[Odilon Redon]], whose approach to art was not outwardly anti-academic, but quietly individual.

This painting was identified as a self-portrait by the artist. Duchamp's primary concern in this painting is the depiction of two movements; that of the train in which there is a young man smoking, and that of the lurching figure itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1179 |title=Marcel Duchamp, 1911–12, ''Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train'', Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230957/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1179 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He studied art at the [[Académie Julian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-duchamp-marcel.htm theartstory.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627194840/http://www.theartstory.org/artist-duchamp-marcel.htm |date=27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(fr)[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rl7vBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1152&amp;dq=Acad%C3%A9mie+Julian&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj50Iu_qsHPAhUFQBQKHUIzB7w4UBDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian&amp;f=false  Victoria Charles, Joseph Manca, Megan McShane, ''1000 Chefs-d'œuvre de la peinture''] {{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1904 to 1905, but preferred playing billiards to attending classes. During this time Duchamp drew and sold cartoons which reflected his ribald humor. Many of the drawings use verbal [[pun]]s (sometimes spanning multiple languages), [[visual pun]]s, or both. Such play with words and symbols engaged his imagination for the rest of his life.

In 1905, he began his compulsory military service with the 39th Infantry Regiment,&lt;ref name="François Lespinasse"&gt;François Lespinasse, ''Robert Antoine Pinchon: 1886–1943'', 1990, repr. Rouen: Association les amis de l'École de Rouen, 2007, {{ISBN|9782906130036}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; working for a printer in Rouen. There he learned [[typography]] and [[printing]] processes—skills he would use in his later work.

Due to his eldest brother [[Jacques Villon|Jacques']] membership in the prestigious [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] Duchamp's work was exhibited in the 1908 [[Salon d'Automne]], and the following year in the [[Salon des Indépendants]]. [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and [[Paul Cézanne]]'s [[proto-Cubism]] influenced his paintings, although the critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]—who was eventually to become a friend—criticized what he called "Duchamp's very ugly nudes" ("les nus très vilains de Duchamp").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=2847420436 Pierre Lartigue, ''Rose Sélavy et caetera''], University of Michigan, Le Passage, 2004, p. 65, {{isbn|2847420436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=2246630819 Judith Housez, ''Marcel Duchamp: biographie''], Grasset, 2006, p. 93, {{ISBN|2246630819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=tKlIAQAAIAAJ Bernard Marcadé, ''Marcel Duchamp: la vie à crédit : biographie''], Flammarion, 2007, p. 28, {{ISBN|2080682261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp also became lifelong friends with exuberant artist [[Francis Picabia]] after meeting him at the 1911 Salon d'Automne, and Picabia proceeded to introduce him to a lifestyle of fast cars and "high" living.

In 1911, at Jacques' home in [[Puteaux]], the brothers hosted a regular discussion group with [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists including Picabia, [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], and [[Alexander Archipenko]]. Poets and writers also participated. The group came to be known as the [[Puteaux Group]], or the [[Section d'Or]]. Uninterested in the Cubists' seriousness, or in their focus on visual matters, Duchamp did not join in discussions of Cubist theory, and gained a reputation of being shy. However, that same year he painted in a Cubist style, and added an impression of motion by using repetitive imagery.

During this period Duchamp's fascination with transition, change, movement, and distance became manifest, and as many artists of the time, he was intrigued with the concept of depicting the [[fourth dimension in art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers &amp; John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Sad Young Man on a Train'' embodies this concern:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, there's the idea of the movement of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this ''elementary parallelism''. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the ''Nude Descending a Staircase''.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, 1971 p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1911, ''Portrait of Chess Players'' (''Portrait de joueurs d'échecs'') there is the Cubist overlapping frames and multiple perspectives of his two brothers playing chess, but to that Duchamp added elements conveying the unseen mental activity of the players. (Notably, "échec" is French for "failure".)

Works from this time also included his first "machine" painting, ''Coffee Mill (Moulin à café)'' (1911), which he gave to his brother Raymond Duchamp-Villon. The later more figurative machine painting of 1914, "Chocolate Grinder" (''Broyeuse de chocolat''), prefigures the mechanism incorporated into the ''Large Glass'' on which he began work in New York the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, ''The Bride and the Bachelors'', New York 1962, pp.31-2&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Duchamp - Nude Descending a Staircase.jpg|thumb|right|Marcel Duchamp. ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). Oil on canvas. 57 7/8" x 35 1/8". [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]

===''Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2''===
{{Main|Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2}}
Duchamp's first work to provoke significant controversy was ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' ''(Nu descendant un escalier n° 2)'' (1912). The painting depicts the mechanistic motion of a nude, with superimposed facets, similar to motion pictures. It shows elements of both the fragmentation and synthesis of the Cubists, and the movement and dynamism of the [[futurism (art)|Futurists]].

He first submitted the piece to appear at the Cubist [[Salon des Indépendants]], but [[Albert Gleizes]] (according to Duchamp in an interview with Pierre Cabanne, p.&amp;nbsp;31)&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20two/duchamp Peter Brooke, The 'rejection' of Nude Descending a Staircase] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109091932/http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20two/duchamp |date=9 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asked Duchamp's brothers to have him voluntarily withdraw the painting, or to paint over the title that he had painted on the work and rename it something else. Duchamp's brothers did approach him with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused. However, there was no jury at the Salon des Indépendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt; The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, but whether it should be hung with the Cubist group.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

Of the incident Duchamp later recalled, "I said nothing to my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really a turning point in my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomkins|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', he participated in the ''[[La Maison Cubiste|La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)]]'', organized by the designer [[André Mare]] for the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the [[Section d'Or]] invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

The painting was exhibited for the first time at [[Galeries Dalmau]], ''Exposició d'Art Cubista'', Barcelona, 1912; the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain&lt;ref name="Robinson et al"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=6EvIx6zOuqgC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=%22August+Agero%22+%22galeries+dalmau%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=egrZl065OV&amp;sig=Jzul0X2w7oi0sxSnSlNlFxlUC4E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYobvKrcPaAhWIxxQKHefzBLMQ6AEIajAN#v=onepage&amp;q=dalmau&amp;f=false William H. Robinson, Jordi Falgàs, Carmen Belen Lord, ''Barcelona and Modernity: Picasso, Gaudí, Miró, Dalí''], Cleveland Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0300121067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp later submitted the painting to the 1913 "[[Armory Show]]" in New York City. In addition to displaying works of American artists, this show was the first major exhibition of modern trends coming out of Paris, encompassing experimental styles of the European [[avant-garde]], including Fauvism, Cubism, and [[Futurism]]. American show-goers, accustomed to realistic art, were scandalized, and the ''Nude'' was at the center of much of the controversy.

==Leaving "retinal art" behind==
At about this time, Duchamp read [[Max Stirner]]'s philosophical tract, ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', the study which he considered another turning point in his artistic and intellectual development. He called it "a remarkable book ... which advances no formal theories, but just keeps saying that the ego is always there in everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomkins|1996|p=unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Munich in 1912, he painted the last of his Cubist-like paintings. He started ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]]'' image, and began making plans for ''The Large Glass'' – scribbling short notes to himself, sometimes with hurried sketches. It would be more than ten years before this piece was completed. Not much else is known about the two-month stay in Munich except that the friend he visited was intent on showing him the sights and the nightlife, and that he was influenced by the works of the sixteenth century German painter [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in Munich's famed [[Alte Pinakothek]], known for its Old Master paintings. Duchamp recalled that he took the short walk to visit this museum daily. Duchamp scholars have long recognized in Cranach the subdued ochre and brown color range Duchamp later employed.&lt;ref name="Naumann"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naumann|first=Francis M.|title=Marcel Duchamp Slept Here|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/11/art/marcel-duchamp-slept-here|work=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=2014-12-16|date=November 6, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216191723/http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/11/art/marcel-duchamp-slept-here|archivedate=16 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Duchamp also attended a performance of a stage adaptation of [[Raymond Roussel]]'s 1910 novel, ''Impressions d'Afrique,'' which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his ''The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even'', also known as ''The Large Glass''. Work on ''The Large Glass'' continued into 1913, with his invention of inventing a repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas on the wall of his apartment.

Toward the end of 1912, he traveled with Picabia, Apollinaire and Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia through the [[Jura mountains]], an adventure that Buffet-Picabia described as one of their "forays of demoralization, which were also forays of witticism and clownery ... the disintegration of the concept of art".&lt;ref name="Mink, J. 2004. Duchamp. Taschen"&gt;Mink, J. (2004). Duchamp. Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp's notes from the trip avoid logic and sense, and have a surrealistic, mythical connotation.

Duchamp painted few canvases after 1912, and in those he did, he attempted to remove "[[painterly]]" effects, and to use a technical drawing approach instead.

His broad interests led him to an exhibition of aviation technology during this period, after which Duchamp said to his friend [[Constantin Brâncuși]], "Painting is washed up. Who will ever do anything better than that propeller? Tell me, can you do that?".&lt;ref name="Mink, J. 2004. Duchamp. Taschen"/&gt; Brâncuși later sculpted [[Bird in Space|bird forms]]. U.S. Customs officials mistook them for aviation parts and attempted to collect import duties on them.

In 1913, Duchamp withdrew from painting circles and began working as a librarian in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève to be able to earn a living wage while concentrating on scholarly realms and working on his ''Large Glass''. He studied math and physics – areas where exciting new discoveries were taking place. The theoretical writings of [[Henri Poincaré]] particularly intrigued and inspired Duchamp. Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that "understood" them and that no theory could be considered "true". "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, H. (1902) Science and Hypothesis. London: Walter Scott Publishing Co., p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the influence of Poincaré's writings, Duchamp tolerated any interpretation of his art by regarding it as the creation of the person who formulated it, not as truth.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, J. (2000). Marcel Duchamp. Art as Anti-Art. Taschen Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's own art-science experiments began during his tenure at the library. To make one of his favorite pieces, ''3 Standard Stoppages'' (''3 stoppages étalon''), he dropped three 1-meter lengths of thread onto prepared canvases, one at a time, from a height of 1 meter. The threads landed in three random undulating positions. He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass. He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box. Three small leather signs with the title printed in gold were glued to the "stoppage" backgrounds. The piece appears to literally follow Poincaré's ''School of the Thread'', part of a book on classical mechanics.

In his studio he mounted a bicycle wheel upside down onto a stool, spinning it occasionally just to watch it. Although it is often assumed that the ''Bicycle Wheel'' represents the first of Duchamp's [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades"]], this particular installation was never submitted for any art exhibition, and it was eventually lost. However, initially, the wheel was simply placed in the studio to create atmosphere: "I enjoyed looking at it just as I enjoy looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace."&lt;ref&gt;Mink, J. (2004) Duchamp. Taschen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

New York: Viking Press. Hachette UK, Jul 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp felt uncomfortable in Paris. Meanwhile, ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2]]'' had scandalized Americans at the [[Armory Show]], and helped secure the sale of all four of his paintings in the exhibition. Thus, being able to finance the trip, Duchamp decided to emigrate to the United States in 1915. To his surprise, he found he was a celebrity when he arrived in New York in 1915, where he quickly befriended art patron [[Katherine Dreier]] and artist [[Man Ray]]. Duchamp's circle included art patrons [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Louise]] and [[Walter Conrad Arensberg]], actress and artist [[Beatrice Wood]] and [[Francis Picabia]], as well as other [[avant-garde]] figures. Though he spoke little English, in the course of supporting himself by giving French lessons, and through some library work, he quickly learned the language. Duchamp became part of an artist colony in [[Ridgefield, New Jersey]], across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=63436#.UcujCm28M6s "Icons of twentieth century photography come to Edinburgh for major Man Ray exhibition"], ArtDaily. Accessed 15 December 2013. "In 1915, whilst at Ridgefield artist colony in New Jersey, he [Man Ray] met the French artist Marcel Duchamp and together they tried to establish a New York outpost of the Dada movement."&lt;/ref&gt;

For two years the Arensbergs, who would remain his friends and patrons for 42 years, were the landlords of his studio. In lieu of rent, they agreed that his payment would be ''The Large Glass''. An art gallery offered Duchamp $10,000 per year in exchange for all of his yearly production, but he declined the offer, preferring to continue his work on ''The Large Glass''.

===Société Anonyme===
Duchamp created the [[Société Anonyme (art)|Société Anonyme]] in 1920, along with Katherine Dreier and Man Ray. This was the beginning of his lifelong involvement in art dealing and collecting. The group collected modern art works, and arranged modern art exhibitions and lectures throughout the 1930s.

By this time [[Walter Pach]], one of the coordinators of the 1913 Armory Show, sought Duchamp's advice on modern art. Beginning with Société Anonyme, Dreier also depended on Duchamp's counsel in gathering her collection, as did Arensberg. Later [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Museum of Modern Art]] directors [[Alfred Barr]] and [[James Johnson Sweeney]] consulted with Duchamp on their modern art collections and shows.

===Dada===
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' 1917, photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]

Dada or Dadaism was an [[art movement]] of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century. It began in [[Zurich]], Switzerland in 1916, spreading to [[Berlin]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;de Micheli, Mario(2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. pp.135–137&lt;/ref&gt; To quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of [[World War I]]. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zurich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality, and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[Marcel Janco]]'s frequent use of the words da, da, meaning yes, yes in the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] language. Another theory says that the name "Dada" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'.&lt;ref&gt;Budd, Dona, ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', Pomegranate Communications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], literature, poetry, [[art manifesto]]es, [[aesthetics|art theory]], theatre, and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-[[bourgeois]] and had political affinities with the radical left.

Dada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement, apart from Duchamp, included: [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Tristan Tzara]], Francis Picabia, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Georg Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], among others. The movement influenced later styles, such as the avant-garde and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[surrealism]], [[Nouveau réalisme]], [[pop art]], and [[Fluxus]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that lay the foundation for Surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, And Provocation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[New York Dada]] had a less serious tone than that of European Dadaism, and was not a particularly organized venture. Duchamp's friend Francis Picabia connected with the Dada group in Zürich, bringing to New York the Dadaist ideas of absurdity and "anti-art". Duchamp and Picabia first met in September 1911 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris, where they were both exhibiting.  Duchamp showed a larger version of his ''Young Man and Girl in Spring'' 1911, a work that had an Edenic theme and a thinly veiled sexuality also found in Picabia's contemporaneous ''Adam and Eve'' 1911.  According to Duchamp, "our friendship began right there".&lt;ref&gt;'' Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia'' ; Edited by Jennifer Mundy; TATE 2008; p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; A group met almost nightly at the [[Walter Arensberg|Arensberg]] home, or caroused in [[Greenwich Village]]. Together with Man Ray, Duchamp contributed his ideas and humor to the New York activities, many of which ran concurrent with the development of his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]] and ''The Large Glass''.

The most prominent example of Duchamp's association with Dada was his submission of ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal, to the [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit in 1917. Artworks in the Independent Artists shows were not selected by jury, and all pieces submitted were displayed. However, the show committee insisted that ''Fountain'' was not art, and rejected it from the show. This caused an uproar among the Dadaists, and led Duchamp to resign from the board of the Independent Artists.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|181–186}}

Along with [[Henri-Pierre Roché]] and Beatrice Wood, Duchamp published a Dada magazine in New York, entitled ''[[The Blind Man]]'', which included art, literature, humor and commentary.

When he returned to Paris after World War I, Duchamp did not participate in the Dada group.

==Readymades==
{{Main|Readymades of Marcel Duchamp}}
"Readymades" were [[found objects]] which Duchamp chose and presented as art. In 1913, Duchamp installed a ''[[Bicycle Wheel]]'' in his studio. However, the idea of ''Readymades'' did not fully develop until 1915. The idea was to question the very notion of Art, and the adoration of art, which Duchamp found "unnecessary".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Interview, BBC TV, Joan Bakewell, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| My idea was to choose an object that wouldn't attract me, either by its beauty or by its ugliness. To find a point of indifference in my looking at it, you see.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;}}

''[[Bottle Rack]]'' (1914), a bottle drying rack signed by Duchamp, is considered to be the first "pure" readymade. ''[[Prelude to a Broken Arm]]'' (1915), a snow shovel, also called ''In Advance of the Broken Arm'', followed soon after. His ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt", shocked the art world in 1917.&lt;ref name="Cabanne, P"/&gt; ''Fountain'' was selected in 2004 as "the most influential artwork of the 20th century" by 500 renowned artists and historians.&lt;ref name="BBC 2010" /&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out:  --&gt;
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1919, L.H.O.O.Q.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Marcel Duchamp, 1919, ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]''&lt;ref name="dadart"&gt;[http://www.dadart.com/dadaism/dada/035a-duchamp-cage.html Marcel Duchamp 1887-1968, dadart.com]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1919, Duchamp made a [[parody]] of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by adorning a cheap reproduction of the painting with a mustache and goatee. To this he added the inscription ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'', a phonetic game which, when read out loud in French quickly sounds like ''"Elle a chaud au cul"''. This can be translated as "She has a hot ass," implying that the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and availability. It may also have been intended as a Freudian joke, referring to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s alleged homosexuality. Duchamp gave a "loose" translation of L.H.O.O.Q. as "there is fire down below" in a late interview with [[Arturo Schwarz]]. According to [[Rhonda Roland Shearer]], the apparent ''Mona Lisa'' reproduction is in fact a copy modeled partly on Duchamp's own face.&lt;ref name="asrl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscienceresearchlab.org/articles/panorama.htm|title=Mona Lisa: Who is Hidden Behind the Woman with the Mustache?|accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=Art Science Research Laboratory|year=2003|author=Marting, Marco De|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320203734/http://www.artscienceresearchlab.org/articles/panorama.htm|archivedate=20 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published by Shearer also speculates that Duchamp himself may have created some of the objects which he claimed to be "found objects".

==''The Large Glass''==
{{Main|The Large Glass}}
[[File:Duchamp LargeGlass.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Large Glass]]'' (1915–23) [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] Collection]]
Duchamp worked on his complex [[Futurism]]-inspired piece ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even|The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass)]]'' from 1915 to 1923, except for periods in [[Buenos Aires]] and Paris in 1918–1920. He executed the work on two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. He published notes for the piece, ''The Green Box'', intended to complement the visual experience. They reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and a mythology which describes the work. He stated that his "hilarious picture" is intended to depict the erotic encounter between a bride and her nine bachelors.

A performance of the stage adaptation of [[Raymond Roussel|Roussel]]'s novel ''Impressions d'Afrique,'' which Duchamp attended in 1912, inspired the piece. Notes, sketches and plans for the work were drawn on his studio walls as early as 1913. In order to concentrate on the work free from material obligations, Duchamp found work as a librarian while living in France. After immigrating to the United States in 1915, he began work on the piece financed by the support of the Arensbergs.

The piece is partly constructed as a retrospective of Duchamp's works, including a three-dimensional reproduction of his earlier paintings ''Bride'' (1912), ''Chocolate Grinder'' (1914) and ''Glider containing a water mill in neighboring metals'' (1913–1915), which has led to numerous interpretations. The work was formally declared "Unfinished" in 1923. Returning from its first public exhibition in a shipping crate, the glass suffered a large crack. Duchamp repaired it, but left the smaller cracks in the glass intact, accepting the chance element as a part of the piece.

[[Joseph Nechvatal]] has cast a considerable light on ''The Large Glass'' by noting the autoerotic implications of both bachelorhood and the repetitive, frenetic machine; he then discerns a larger constellation of themes by insinuating that autoeroticsm — and with the machine as omnipresent partner and practitioner — opens out into a subversive pan-sexuality as expressed elsewhere in Duchamp's work and career, in that a trance-inducing pleasure becomes the operative principle as opposed to the dictates of the traditional male-female coupling; and he as well documents the existence of this theme cluster throughout modernism, starting with Rodin's controversial [[Monument to Balzac]], and culminating in a Duchampian vision of a techno-universe in which one and all can find themselves welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/4/67|author=Joseph Nechvatal|date=18 October 2018|title=Before and Beyond the Bachelor Machine|journal=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7040067|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1969 when the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] revealed Duchamp's ''[[Étant donnés]]'' tableau, ''The Large Glass'' was thought to have been his last major work.

==Kinetic works==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, photo Man Ray, 391 n. 13, July 1920.jpg|thumb|Marcel Duchamp, 1918, ''A regarder d'un oeil, de près, pendant presque une heure, To Be Looked at (from the Other Side of the Glass) with One Eye, Close to, for Almost an Hour''. Photograph by Man Ray, published in [[391 (magazine)|391]], July 1920 (N13), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
Duchamp's interest in [[kinetic art|kinetic works]] can be discerned as early as the notes for ''[[The Large Glass]]'' and the ''[[Bicycle Wheel]]'' readymade, and despite losing interest in "retinal art," he retained interest in visual phenomena. In 1920, with help from Man Ray, Duchamp built a motorized sculpture, ''Rotative plaques verre, optique de précision'' ("Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics"). The piece, which he did not consider to be art, involved a motor to spin pieces of rectangular glass on which were painted segments of a circle. When the apparatus spins, an optical illusion occurs, where the segments appear to be closed [[Concentric objects|concentric circles]]. Man Ray set up equipment to photograph the initial experiment, but when they turned the machine for the second time, a belt broke, and caught a piece of the glass, which after glancing off Man Ray's head, shattered into bits.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|227–228}}

After moving back to Paris in 1923, at [[André Breton]]'s urging, with financing by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]], Duchamp built another optical device based on the first one, ''Rotative Demisphère, optique de précision'' (Rotary Demisphere, Precision Optics). This time the optical element was a globe cut in half, with black concentric circles painted on it. When it spins, the circles appear to move backward and forward in space. Duchamp asked that Doucet not exhibit the apparatus as art.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|254–255}}

''Rotoreliefs'' were the next phase of Duchamp's spinning works. To make the optical "play toys", he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable. When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional. He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring three-dimensional [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] sight to people who have lost vision in one eye.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|301–303}} In collaboration with Man Ray and [[Marc Allégret]], Duchamp filmed early versions of the ''Rotoreliefs'' and they named the film, ''[[Anemic Cinema|Anémic Cinéma]]'' (1926). Later, in [[Alexander Calder]]'s studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called "[[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]". Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show. To this day, sculptures of this type are called "mobiles".&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|294}}

==Musical ideas==
Between 1912 and 1915, Duchamp worked with various musical ideas. At least three pieces have survived: two compositions and a note for a musical happening. The two compositions are based on [[Aleatoric music|chance operations]]. ''Erratum Musical'', written for three voices, was published in 1934. ''La Mariée mise à nu par ses célibataires même. Erratum Musical'' is unfinished and was never published or exhibited during Duchamp's lifetime. According to the manuscript, the piece was intended for a mechanical instrument "in which the virtuoso intermediary is suppressed". The manuscript also contains a description for "An apparatus automatically recording fragmented musical periods," consisting of a funnel, several open-end cars and a set of numbered balls.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Kotik. Liner Notes to CD "The Music of Marcel Duchamp", Edition Block + Paula Cooper Gallery, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces predate [[John Cage]]'s ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951), which is often considered the first modern piece to be conceived largely through random procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael. 2002. The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians. {{ISBN|0-674-00978-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duchamp and John Cage appeared together at a concert entitled "Reunion", playing a game of chess and composing [[Aleatoric music]] by triggering a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard.&lt;ref name="toutfait.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/lotringer.html |title="Becoming Duchamp" by Sylvère Lotringer |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312133029/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/lotringer.html |archivedate=12 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rrose Sélavy==
[[File:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|left|200px|''Rrose Sélavy'' (Marcel Duchamp), 1921 photograph by Man Ray, art direction by Marcel Duchamp, silver print, 5-7/8" x 3"-7/8", [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
"Rrose Sélavy", also spelled Rose Sélavy, was one of Duchamp's pseudonyms. The name, a [[pun]], sounds like the French phrase ''[[Eros (concept)|Eros]], c'est la vie'', which may be translated as "Eros, such is life." It has also been read as ''arroser la vie'' ("to make a toast to life"). Sélavy emerged in 1921 in a series of photographs by Man Ray showing Duchamp dressed as a woman. Through the 1920s Man Ray and Duchamp collaborated on more photos of Sélavy. Duchamp later used the name as the byline on written material and signed several creations with it.

Duchamp used the name in the title of at least one [[sculpture]], ''[[Why Not Sneeze Rose Selavy?]]'' (1921).  The sculpture, a type of readymade called an [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], consists of an [[Medical thermometer#Oral|oral thermometer]], a couple of dozen small cubes of [[marble]] resembling [[sugar]] cubes and a [[cuttlefish bone]] inside a [[birdcage]]. Sélavy also appears on the label of ''[[Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette]]'' (1921), a readymade that is a perfume bottle in the original box. Duchamp also signed his film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926) with the Sélavy name.

The inspiration for the name Rrose Sélavy has been thought to be [[Belle da Costa Greene]], [[J.P. Morgan]]'s librarian at [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] (formerly The Pierpont Morgan Library) who, following his death, became the Library's director, working there for a total of forty-three years. Empowered by J.P. Morgan, and then by his son Jack, Greene built the collection buying and selling rare [[manuscripts]], [[books]] and [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutfait.com/online_journal_details.php?postid=866 Duchamp Bottles Belle Greene: Just Desserts For His Canning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027213202/http://www.toutfait.com/online_journal_details.php?postid=866 |date=27 October 2012 }} by Bonnie Jean Garner.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rrose Sélavy, and the other pseudonyms Duchamp used, may be read as a comment on the fallacy of romanticizing the conscious individuality or subjectivity of the artist, a theme that is also a prominent subtext of the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]. Duchamp said in an interview, "You think you're doing something entirely your own, and a year later you look at it and you see actually the roots of where your art comes from without your knowing it at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|title=Marcel Duchamp: The Afternoon Interviews|year=2013|publisher=ARTBOOK {{!}} D.A.P.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1936440393|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 the name Rrose Sélavy also started appearing in a series of [[aphorism]]s, puns, and [[spoonerism]]s by the French [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[poet]] [[Robert Desnos]]. Desnos tried to portray Rrose Sélavy as a long-lost aristocrat and rightful queen of France. Aphorism 13 paid homage to Marcel Duchamp: "Rrose Sélavy connaît bien le marchand du sel" ‒ in English: "Rrose Sélavy knows the [[merchant]] of [[salt]] well"; in French the final words sound like Mar-champ Du-cel. Note that the 'salt seller' aphorism – "mar-chand-du-sel" – is a phonetic rearrangement of the syllables in the artist's name:  "mar-cel-du-champ." (Duchamp's compiled notes are entitled, 'Salt Seller'.) In 1939 a collection of these aphorisms was published under the name of Rrose Sélavy, entitled, ''Poils et coups de pieds en tous genres''.

== Transition from art to chess ==
[[File:Man Ray, 1920, Three Heads (Joseph Stella and Marcel Duchamp), gelatin silver print, 20.7 x 15.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Man Ray, 1920, ''Three Heads'' ([[Joseph Stella]] and Marcel Duchamp, painting bust portrait of Man Ray above Duchamp), gelatin silver print, 20.7 x 15.7 cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
In 1918, Duchamp took leave of the New York art scene, interrupting his work on the ''Large Glass'', and went to Buenos Aires, where he remained for nine months and often played [[chess]]. He [[woodcarving|carved]] his own [[chess set]] from wood with help from a local craftsman who made the [[Knight (chess)|knights]]. He moved to Paris in 1919, and then back to the United States in 1920. Upon his return to Paris in 1923, Duchamp was, in essence, no longer a practicing artist. Instead, his main interest was chess, which he studied for the rest of his life to the exclusion of most other activities.

Duchamp is seen, briefly, playing chess with Man Ray in the short film ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' (1924) by [[René Clair]]. He designed the 1925 Poster for the Third French Chess Championship, and as a competitor in the event, finished at fifty percent (3–3, with two draws), earning the title of [[chess master]]. During this period his fascination with chess so distressed his first wife that she glued his pieces to the [[chessboard|board]]. Duchamp continued to play in the French Championships and also in the [[Chess Olympiad]]s from 1928–1933, favoring [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] openings such as the [[Nimzo-Indian]].

Sometime in the early 1930s, Duchamp reached the height of his ability, but realized that he had little chance of winning recognition in top-level chess. In the following years, his participation in chess tournaments declined, but he discovered [[correspondence chess]] and became a chess journalist, writing weekly newspaper columns. While his contemporaries were achieving spectacular success in the art world by selling their works to high-society collectors, Duchamp observed,  "I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be [[commercialized]]. Chess is much purer than art in its social position."&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine. 10 March 1952&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Duchamp elaborated, "The chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts; and these thoughts, although making a visual design on the chess-board, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem. ... I have come to the personal conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists."&lt;ref&gt;"Marcel Duchamp." Kynaston McShine.1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Duchamp's Problem with White to play&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Duchamp's Problem - Chess Forums - Chess.com|url=https://www.chess.com/forum/view/endgames/marcel-duchamps-problem|website=Chess.com|accessdate=19 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119121038/https://www.chess.com/forum/view/endgames/marcel-duchamps-problem|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1932, Duchamp teamed with chess theorist [[Vitaly Halberstadt]] to publish ''L'opposition et cases conjuguées sont réconciliées'' ([[Opposition (chess)|Opposition]] and Sister Squares are Reconciled), known as [[corresponding squares]]. This treatise describes the [[Corresponding squares#Lasker-Reichhelm position|Lasker-Reichhelm position]], an extremely rare type of position that can arise in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]]. Using [[Enneagram (geometry)|enneagram]]-like charts that fold upon themselves, the authors demonstrated that in this position, the most Black can hope for is a [[Draw (chess)|draw]].

The theme of the "endgame" is important to an understanding of Duchamp's complex attitude toward his artistic career. Irish playwright [[Samuel Beckett]] was an associate of Duchamp, and used the theme as the narrative device for the 1957 play of the same name, ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''. In 1968, Duchamp played an artistically important chess match with avant-garde composer John Cage, at a concert entitled "Reunion". Music was produced by a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard, triggered sporadically by normal game play.&lt;ref name="toutfait.com"/&gt;

On choosing a career in chess, Duchamp said, "If [[Bobby Fischer]] came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would try to make it positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted."&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Frank: ''Bobby Fischer: profile of a prodigy'', Courier Dover Publications, 1989; p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp left a legacy to chess in the form of an enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition ''Through the Big End of the Opera Glass'', printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.&lt;ref&gt;Beliavsky, A &amp; Mikhalchishin, A: ''Winning Endgame Technique'' Batsford, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later artistic involvement==
Although Duchamp was no longer considered to be an active artist, he continued to consult with artists, art dealers and collectors. From 1925 he often traveled between France and the United States, and made New York's Greenwich Village his home in 1942. He also occasionally worked on artistic projects such as the short film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926), ''Box in a Valise'' (1935–41), ''Self Portrait in Profile'' (1958) and the larger work ''Étant Donnés'' (1946–66). In 1943, he participated with [[Maya Deren]] in her unfinished film ''[[The Witch's Cradle]]'', filmed in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[Art of This Century gallery]].

From the mid-1930s onward, he collaborated with the [[surrealism|Surrealists]]; however, he did not join the movement, despite the coaxing of [[André Breton]]. From then until 1944, together with [[Max Ernst]], [[Eugenio Granell]], and Breton, Duchamp edited the Surrealist periodical ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'', and served as an advisory editor for the magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'', which featured him in its March 1945 edition, thus introducing him to a broader American audience.

Duchamp's influence on the art world remained behind the scenes until the late 1950s, when he was "discovered" by young artists such as [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]], who were eager to escape the dominance of [[Abstract Expressionism]]. He was a co-founder of the international literary group [[Oulipo]] in 1960. Interest in Duchamp was reignited in the 1960s, and he gained international public recognition. In 1963, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] mounted his first retrospective exhibition, and there he appeared in an iconic photograph playing chess opposite nude model [[Eve Babitz]].&lt;ref name="Anolik"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anolik|first=Lili|title=All About Eve—and Then Some|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/eve-babitz-los-angeles-party-scene|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=2014-03-01|date=March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228110425/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/eve-babitz-los-angeles-party-scene|archivedate=28 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was later described by the [[Smithsonian Archives of American Art]] as being "among the key documentary images of American modern art".&lt;ref name=Karlstrom&gt;{{cite web|last=Karlstrom|first=Paul|title=Oral history interview with Eve Babitz, 2000 Jun 14|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-eve-babitz-12164|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2014-03-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306082515/http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-eve-babitz-12164|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the [[Tate Gallery]] hosted a large exhibit of his work. Other major institutions, including the [[Philadelphia Art Museum]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], followed with large showings of Duchamp's work. He was invited to lecture on art and to participate in formal discussions, as well as sitting for interviews with major publications. As the last surviving member of the Duchamp family of artists, in 1967 Duchamp helped to organize an exhibition in Rouen, France, called ''Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp''. Parts of this family exhibition were later shown again at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris.

===Exhibition design===
Duchamp participated in the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the ''Galerie des Beaux-arts'', Paris. The show featured more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, [[Wolfgang Paalen]], Man Ray, [[Salvador Dali]], and [[Max Ernst]] to help him. At the exhibition's entrance Breton placed Salvador Dalí's ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'', a work consisting of a [[taxicab]] rigged to produce a drizzle of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond [[mannequin]] covered with live [[snail]]s in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.

''Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists. The main hall was a simulation of a dark subterranean cave with 1,200 empty coal bags suspended from the ceiling. The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. In the middle of the grand hall underneath Duchamp's coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]] and reeds, which he called ''Avant La Mare''. A single light bulb provided the only illumination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302054012/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; so patrons were given [[flashlight]]s with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while the aroma of [[Coffee roasting|roasting coffee]] filled the air. Around midnight, the visitors witnessed the dancing shimmer of a scantily dressed girl who suddenly arose from the reeds, jumped on a bed, shrieked hysterically, then disappeared just as quickly. Much to the surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests.

In 1942, for the ''First Papers of Surrealism'' show in New York, surrealists called on Duchamp to design the exhibition. He wove a three-dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_9.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623062319/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_9.html |archivedate=23 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp made a secret arrangement with an associate's son to bring young friends to the opening of the show. When the formally-dressed patrons arrived, they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls, and skipping rope. When questioned, the children were told to say "Mr. Duchamp told us we could play here". Duchamp's design of the catalog for the show included "found", rather than posed, photographs of the artists.

==Personal  life==
Throughout his adult life, Duchamp  was a passionate smoker of Habana cigars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=door K-films |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xdxdm6_les-grandes-repetitions-extraits-de_music |title=see him on film |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512220326/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xdxdm6_les-grandes-repetitions-extraits-de_music |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp became a United States citizen in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Duchamp|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/marcel-duchamp|website=Guggenheim|accessdate=26 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703130334/https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/marcel-duchamp|archivedate=3 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1927, Duchamp married [[:fr:Lydie Sarazin-Levassor|Lydie Sarazin-Lavassor]]; however, they divorced six months later. It was rumored that Duchamp had chosen a marriage of convenience, because Sarazin-Lavassor was the daughter of a wealthy automobile manufacturer. Early in January 1928, Duchamp said that he could no longer bear the responsibility and confinement of marriage, and they were soon divorced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pontus Hultén|Hulten, Pontus]].

Between 1946 and 1951 [[Maria Martins (artist)|Maria Martins]] was his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/arts/design/28duchamp.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;  |title=Landscape of Eros, Through the Peephole |last=Cotter |first=Holland |date=August 27, 2009 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he and [[Alexina Duchamp|Alexina "Teeny" Sattler]] married. They remained together until his death.

==Death and burial==

Duchamp died suddenly and peacefully in the early morning of 2 October 1968 at his home in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France. After an evening dining at home with his friends Man Ray and [[:fr:Robert Lebel (critique)|Robert Lebel]], Duchamp retired at 1:05&amp;nbsp;A.M., collapsed in his studio, and died of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Marcel+Duchamp+died+peacefully&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mg3KUcGACYjK4ASZx4CAAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcel%20Duchamp%20died%20peacefully&amp;f=false |title=Rudolf Ernst Kuenzli, Francis M.

Duchamp was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780786749713|page=106|quote=Cabanne: "Do you believe in God?"

Even in his death, Duchamp retained a sense of humor (a means for him of reaffirming his freedom, while undermining absolutes and certainties).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

He advised modern art collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures, thereby helping to shape the tastes of [[Western art history|Western art]] during this period.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"&gt;Tomkins: ''Duchamp: A Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I don't know what pages right now. I'll have to read the book again. -sparkit--&gt; He challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and rejected the emerging art market, through subversive anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, 1966, p.38-39&lt;/ref&gt; He famously dubbed a urinal art and named it ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]''. Duchamp produced relatively few artworks and remained mostly aloof of the avant-garde circles of his time. He went on to pretend to abandon art and devote the rest of his life to chess, while secretly continuing to make art.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers &amp; John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Duchamp said of creativity,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Duchamp, from Session on the Creative Act, Convention of the American Federation of Arts, Houston, Texas, April 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duchamp in his later life explicitly expressed negativity toward art. In a BBC interview with Duchamp conducted by [[Joan Bakewell]] in 1968 he compared art with religion, saying that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that "the word art etymologically means to do," that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates "purely artificial" distinctions of being an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Bakewell in conversation with Marcel Duchamp|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04826th|website=BBC Arts|date=1968|accessdate=8 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926044032/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04826th|archivedate=26 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Marcel Duchamp | isbn = 9780262610728 | author1 = Kuenzli | first1 = Rudolf Ernst | last2 = Naumann | first2 = Francis M | year = 1990 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170122065407/https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate = 22 January 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation erroneously attributed to Duchamp suggests a negative attitude toward later trends in 20th century art:

{{quote|This Neo-Dada, which they call New Realism, Pop Art, Assemblage, etc., is an easy way out, and lives on what Dada did. When I discovered the ready-mades I sought to discourage aesthetics. In Neo-Dada they have taken my readymades and found aesthetic beauty in them, I threw the bottle-rack and the urinal into their faces as a challenge and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty.}}

However, this was written in 1961 by fellow Dadaist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], in the second person, i.e. "You threw the bottle-rack...". Although a marginal note in the letter suggests that Duchamp generally approved of the statement, Richter did not make the distinction clear until many years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_5/articles/girst2/girst1.html "(Ab)Using Marcel Duchamp: The Concept of the Readymade in Post-War and Contemporary American Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507233803/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_5/articles/girst2/girst1.html |date=7 May 2006 }} by Thomas Girst at toutfait.com, Issue 5, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's attitude was more favorable, however, as evidenced by another statement made in 1964:

{{quote|Pop Art is a return to "conceptual" painting, virtually abandoned, except by the Surrealists, since [Gustave] Courbet, in favor of retinal painting... If you take a Campbell soup can and repeat it 50 times, you are not interested in the retinal image. What interests you is the concept that wants to put 50 Campbell soup cans on a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Constable, "New York's Avant-garde, and How It Got There," ''New York Herald Tribune'', May 17, 1964, p. 10,  cited in Jennifer Gough-Cooper and Jacques Caumont, "Ephemerides on and about Marcel Duchamp and Rrose Sélavy, 1887-1968," in Pontus Hulten, ed., ''Marcel Duchamp'', Cambridge, MIT Press, 1993, entry for May 17, 1964. See also [[Campbell's Soup Cans#Message]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Marcel Duchamp Prize|Prix Marcel Duchamp]] (Marcel Duchamp Prize), established in 2000, is an annual award given to a young artist by the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]. In 2004, as a testimony to the legacy of Duchamp's work to the art world, a panel of prominent artists and art historians voted ''Fountain'' "the most influential artwork of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="BBC 2010" /&gt;

'''Margaret Crittendon Douglass''' (born 1822; year of death unknown) was a  [[Southern United States|Southern]] white woman  who served one month in jail in 1854 for teaching free black children to read in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].  Refusing to hire a defense attorney, she defended herself in court and later published a book about her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Appletons|wstitle = Douglass, Margaret Crittenden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case drew public attention to the [[Education during the Slave Period|highly restrictive laws against black literacy]] in the [[Antebellum South|pre-Civil War American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret,  Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of  Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison Lawson, John, American State Trials: A Collection of the Important and Interesting Criminal Trials which Have Taken Place in the United States, from the Beginning of Our Government to the Present Day : with Notes and Annotations, Volume 7, Thomas Law Book Company, 1914,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Douglass was born  in 1822 in [[Washington, D.C.]], but moved in her childhood to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she married. By age fourteen, she had given birth to a daughter, Hannah Rosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gss=angs-g&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Margaret&amp;gsfn_x=0&amp;gsln=Douglass&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;mswpn__ftp=Norfolk%2c+Independent+Cities%2c+Virginia%2c+USA&amp;mswpn=24283&amp;mswpn_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3245%7c49%7c0%7c24255%7c24283%7c0%7c&amp;MSAV=1&amp;msbdy=1822&amp;cp=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;uidh=r94&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=15375122&amp;db=1850usfedcenancestry&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=1 Margaret Douglass, Hannah Rosa Douglass, 1850 Census, Norfolk, Virginia, www. ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also birthed a son, who died. Nothing is known about her husband. In 1845, she and her daughter relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, where she established herself in a modest apartment in a tenement neighborhood and made ends meet by running her own business as a seamstress and vest maker. She chose not to participate in social activities with her white neighbors in the nearby tenements, who she felt were "not of the most refined class". She notes in her memoir that this made her unpopular in the neighborhood. She described her life as "frugal and retiring", and that it was "necessary for me to labor incessantly".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret, The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854 p.6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
In 1853 she paid a business visit to the [[barber]] shop of a free black man named Robinson.  Mr. Robinson was  a man of influence in the community  of  more than 1500 [[Free negro|free people of color]] who lived in Norfolk at that time.&lt;ref&gt;John Henderson Russell, The Free Negro in Virginia, 1619-1865 (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1913), 57-58. [https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Virginia_African_Americans#Free_People_of_Colo Digital version] at [https://archive.org/details/freenegro00russrich Internet Archiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  His two young sons were busy studying a [[Primer (textbook)|reading primer]], so Douglass asked Robinson if there wasn't a school in town where free black children could learn to read.  Robinson said  that there was only the Sunday school at Christ Church  where, he said, "they didn't learn much."  Douglass returned home and asked her teenaged daughter, Hannah Rosa, if she would like to tutor the boys.  Hannah Rosa said she would, and the boys began to receive free reading lessons at the Douglass home, using the books they received at church. Eventually, Robiinson took his sons back to the barber shop where he needed their help, and sent his two daughters instead. In her memoir, Douglass states that the two girls were intelligent, attentive, made rapid progress, and were "a source of pleasure to us."

A month later, Margaret and Hannah Rosa decided to open a small school for free black children in their home, and  charge three dollars per student per quarter. Robinson spread word to the free black community, and the school was deluged with applications. For 11 months, they taught 25 children, who Douglass described as "well-behaved" and "anxious to be taught".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2945.html|title=Mrs. Margaret Douglass|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of her female students grew ill, Douglass made regular visits to her home, and  arranged for and participated in the girl's funeral  when she died.  This, according to Douglass, was not approved of by other whites in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass,  p.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest ==
On the  morning of May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the children were assembled at their desks, two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back door of her house.  They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/brown/brown-segregation.html#obj1|title=A Century of Racial Segregation 1849–1950 - Brown v.

"You have a very large family", Mayor Stubbs commented when she and the 25 children arrived at his office. He then asked her if she was aware of the law. Douglass responded that she didn't know teaching free black children was illegal, but that if it were  illegal for her to teach the children it should also be illegal for the church to do it, since she was using the same books. The mayor dismissed the matter and sent everyone home, after assuring Douglass that nothing would happen to the black children or their families.&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the courtroom, Douglass noted that she was met by a group of free black adults, parents of the children and their friends, waiting to hear the decision and offering to pay for any penalties or bail she might incur. 
She gathered the children back at the school, gave them back their books and slates, and said goodbye. "It was a sad parting", she wrote in her memoir.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

After her daughter Hannah Rosa left Norfolk for New York on  June 29, Douglas was left alone, receiving however frequent gifts of flowers from her former students who stopped by to see her.

Of the outpouring of support she received from the black community. Douglas writes, "In my opinion, those who call the Southern Negroes ungrateful are only those who never do anything to call forth that emotion....May I ask what gratitude they owe to those who would degrade them?  What gratitude does that child owe to his own father, who would coldly sell  him as  a slave?"&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p. 14–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Although she thought the case was now behind her, on July 13, she was served legal papers for a [[Grand jury|Grand Jury Indictment]] for her and her 17-year-old daughter, which stated: "Each of them did unlawfully assemble with diver negros, for the purpose of instructing them to read and to write, and did instruct them to read and to write, contrary to the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia'.&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Having little money and 'little affection for lawyers', Douglass decided to defend herself. She did not mention the upcoming trial to her daughter, who was still in New York, until September 1, when she instructed her to stay until further notice. On November 11, she entered the crowded courtroom alone, wearing a black velvet dress, white kid gloves and a plain straw bonnet. 'Everyone present seemed to be confused, except myself,' she noted.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

She called three male members of Christ's Church as her witnesses, two of them also lawyers, one who had signed the summons against her. The excitement in the courtroom when these three witnesses arrived was 'most intense', she noted. In her memoir, she states that these men, who she describes as part of the 'aristocracy' of Norfolk, were either lecturers at the church's Sunday school, or had wives and daughters who were, and had given the free black children of the community the same books she was using to teach them to read. The witnesses either denied teaching altogether or said they had only provided moral and religious instruction, but did not teach the black children how to read and write.

In her closing speech to the jury, Douglass described herself as a Southern woman, a former slave-holder. She said she was not against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and strongly opposed to northern [[abolitionist]] interference, though she believed their 'principles are based on a religious foundation'. She believed, she said, in 'the duty of every Southerner, morally and religiously to instruct his slaves, that they may know their duties to their masters and their common God. Let the masters first do their duty to them, for they are still our slaves and servants, whether bond or free, and can be nothing else in our community.' She also challenged the indifference of the white population towards the situation of the free and enslaved black population, where there was misery, starvation, and harsh laws in place to control them, noting that it was illegal for more than two or three of them to assemble in one place, for whatever reason.

'When they are sick, or in want, on whom does the duty devolve to seek them out and administer to their necessities? Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? Oh no, it is not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a negro hut for the purpose of alleviating the wretchedness he may find within it. Why then persecute your benevolent ladies for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected? Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion than we do the cattle in the field?"

She also told the jury that although they had nothing to fear from the 'true blooded' negroes, she felt that those who had 'white blood in their veins' were 'presumptuous, treacherous, and revengeful.' "Ask how that white blood got beneath those tawny skins," she suggested, "and let nature herself account for the exhibition of these instincts. Blame the authors of this devilish mischief, but not the victims of it."

In closing, she offered that she was willing to go to prison if she had to, but that the black anti-literacy law, she said, was 'one of the most inhuman and unjust laws that ever disgraced the statute book of a civilized community.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/margaret-douglass/|title=Margaret Douglass – Civil War Women|website=www.civilwarwomenblog.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

When she rested her case, the judge asked if anyone wanted to speak in her favor. No one came forward.

Douglass successfully argued for dropping the charges against Hannah Rosa, since she was still a minor. At the close of the trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found her guilty, and fined her one dollar. She then left for New York to retrieve her daughter.

==Sentencing and jail==
On January 10, 1854, she was called back before Judge Baker for further sentencing.

The Judge noted that some people in Norfolk were opposed to the law, and chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which you spoke of the colored race in general'. 'Such opinions I regard as manifestly mischievous', he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because religious instruction is necessary for black people. Black literacy, however, is dangerous. He described the law as a "matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats," and who "scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti-slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy". He also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case to have been presented in a 'far more favorable light'. Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, 'is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and 'something more substantial is required in this case'.

'For these reasons', he continued, 'as an example to all others in like cases disposed to offend, and in vindication of the policy and justness of our laws, which every individual should be taught to respect, the judgment of the Court is, in addition to the proper fine and costs, that you be imprisoned for the period of one month in the jail of this city'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2945t.html The Case of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, Africans in America, PBS.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass served out her sentence. Having no where else to stay when she was released, the jailer and his wife put her up for two days before she moved with her daughter to Philadelphia.

==Media coverage==
The case received substantial media coverage at the time, both for and against Douglass and the anti-literacy law. Under the headline "Her Own Lawyer," an editor in the ''Petersburg Daily Express'' wrote of how the courtroom was 'filled with persons anxious to witness the novel spectacle' of a woman defending herself and compared her speech making abilities to renowned feminists like [[Lucy Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;Her Own Lawyer, Petersburg Daily Express, 1853, cited in Douglass&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her disavowal of abolitionism,  she was hailed as a heroine by abolitionists. [[William Lloyd Garrison]], in his abolitionist newspaper, ''The Liberator'',  noted that a Quaker woman in Norfolk had delivered a sermon on Douglass' behalf while Douglass was in jail and stated, "The women are a great trouble to our Norfolk neighbors", he said. "If they want peace, they will have to expel all Christian women... from the city."  &lt;ref&gt;Garrison, William LLoyd, The Liberator, November, 1853, cited in ''Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery'', John McKivigan, Mitchell Snay  University of Georgia Press, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of the Virginia newspaper ''The Argus'' wrote that although the Norfolk community was reluctant to put a white woman in prison, 'there rose a righteous indignation towards a person who would throw contempt in the face of our laws, and brave the imprisonment for 'the cause of humanity' '.

'Let her depart hence with only one wish, that her presence will never be intruded upon us again. Let her seek her associates at the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to such mischievous views as fell from her lips last November, sentiments unworthy of a resident of the State, and in direct rebellion against our Constitution", he wrote.

In the religious publication ''Covenanter: Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church'', (Volume 9, 1853) David Smith called upon the Presbyterian General Assembly to intercede with the U.S. government to "secure for all its citizens the rights of teaching human beings to read the language of their country..." He noted that the United States government had interceded when Presbyterian women had been imprisoned in foreign Catholic countries for passing out Bibles, but would not intervene in Douglas's case.

The case, Smith said, has "exposed the country to the contempt and hissing of every  civilized country on earth".&lt;ref&gt;''Covenanter, Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church,'' Volume 9, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoir and legacy==
In 1854, Douglass published her memoir of the event, ''Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman, who was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, Under the Laws of Virginia, for the Crime of Teaching Free Colored Children to Read.'' In it, she describes the trial as well as the events that led up to it, and includes the speech she made in her own self-defense.  As she did in her courtroom speech, she criticizes the black literacy and assembly laws as well as white indifference to the situation of blacks, but identifies herself as a Southern supporter of slavery, and a [[white supremacist]]:

"I have been a slaveholder myself, and, if circumstances rendered it necessary or practicable, I might be such again".&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/personalnarrativ1854doug#page/5/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

Pointing out that many of the black and [[mixed race]] children she was teaching were the children of the same white men who aided in the prosecution against her, she lays some of the blame for the condition of black people on Southern white men who sexually abused enslaved black women. This, she believed, is the root of the  anti-literacy law. "How important then for these Southern Sultans that the objects of their criminal passions should be kept in utter ignorance and degradation", she writes. She speaks of the  silent frustration of white women who know of their husbands' 'tawny mistresses' and the powerlessness of black women, who have "parents, brothers, sisters, a lover perhaps, all of whom suffer through and with her, and in whose hearts spring up roots of bitterness which are destined to grow into trees whose branches will sooner or later overshadow the whole land." She ends her memoir calling upon her white "Southern sisters" to  remedy this situation:

"I know my Southern sisters well enough to believe that they will not much longer rest tamely under the influence of this damning curse. I have told them plainly of the evil. The remedy is in their hands".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Margaret Douglass's life after her trial.

In June 1865 the members of the free black community of Norfolk, Virginia petitioned the federal government to abolish the restrictive literacy and assembly laws that were still in place in their community.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/freedom/text5/equalsuffrage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The law was abolished in 1867.

Documents and publications about Douglass's trial and her subsequent memoir have helped shed light on the era she lived in for scholars of American history, race relations, women's history, religion and law.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Rhodes Balme Hamilton, "American States,Churches and Slavery" Adams and Company, 1864&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;: Christopher Lasch, Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism, W.W. Norton and Co, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; One legal scholar wrote that with the case of Margaret Douglass: "The modern era of Anglo-American Law had arrived early, and the principal actor had been, appropriately, a woman.   Her jury speech had, appropriately, employed the female metaphor of the family, in which all the children deserved equality of treatment. It was a metaphor, and an idea, that would come to dominate the legal discourse of America." &lt;ref&gt;The Life of the Law: The People and Cases that Have Shaped Our Society,  By Alfred H. Knight.  Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mean inter-particle distance''' (or mean inter-particle separation) is the mean distance between microscopic particles (usually [[atoms]] or [[molecules]]) in a macroscopic body.

==Ambiguity==

From the very general considerations, the mean inter-particle distance is proportional to the size of the per-particle volume &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., 
: &lt;math&gt;\langle r \rangle \sim 1/n^{1/3},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n = N/V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[particle density (particle count)|particle density]]. However, barring a few simple cases such as the [[ideal gas]] model, precise calculations of the proportionality factor are impossible analytically. Therefore, approximate expressions are often used. One such an estimation is the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]]
: &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{3}{4 \pi n} \right)^{1/3},&lt;/math&gt;
which corresponds to the radius of a sphere having per-particle volume &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;. Another popular definition is
: &lt;math&gt;1/n^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;,
corresponding to the length of the edge of the cube with the per-particle volume &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;. The two definitions differ by a factor of approximately &lt;math&gt;1.61&lt;/math&gt;, so one has to exercise care if an article fails to define the parameter exactly. On the other hand, it is often used in qualitative statements where such a numeric factor is either irrelevant or plays an insignificant role, e.g.,

* "a potential energy ... is proportional to some power n of the inter-particle distance r" ([[Virial theorem]])
* "the inter-particle distance is much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength" ([[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]])

==Ideal gas==
===Nearest neighbor distribution===
[[File:PDF NN in ideal gas.svg|thumb|300px|PDF of the NN distances in an ideal gas.]]
We want to calculate [[probability distribution function]] of distance to the nearest neighbor (NN) particle. (The problem was first considered by [[Paul Hertz]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Let us assume &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles inside a sphere having volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;n = N/V&lt;/math&gt;. Note that since the particles in the ideal gas are non-interacting, the probability to find a particle at a certain distance from another particle is the same as probability to find a particle at the same distance from any other point; we shall use the center of the sphere.

An NN particle at distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; means exactly one of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles resides at that distance while the rest 
&lt;math&gt;N - 1&lt;/math&gt; particles are at larger distances, i.e., they are somewhere outside the sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

The probability to find a particle at the distance from the origin between &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r + dr&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;(4 \pi r^2/V) dr&lt;/math&gt;, plus we have &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; kinds of way to choose which particle , while the probability to find a particle outside that sphere is &lt;math&gt;1 - 4\pi r^3/3V&lt;/math&gt;. The sought-for expression is then

:&lt;math&gt;P_N(r)dr = 4 \pi r^2 dr\frac{N}{V}\left(1 - \frac{4\pi}{3}r^3/V \right)^{N - 1} =
                \frac{3}{ a}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2 dr \left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^3 \frac{1}{N} \right)^{N - 1}\, &lt;/math&gt;
where we substituted
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V} = \frac{3}{4 \pi N a^{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the Wigner-Seitz radius. Finally, taking the &lt;math&gt;N \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; limit and using &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x = e&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;P(r) = \frac{3}{a}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2 e^{-(r/a)^3}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

One can immediately check that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty}P(r)dr = 1\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution peaks at 
:&lt;math&gt;r_{\text{peak}} = \left(2/3\right)^{1/3} a \approx 0.874 a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Mean distance and higher NN distribution moments===

:&lt;math&gt; \langle r^k \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty}P(r) r^k dr = 3 a^k\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{k+2}e^{-x^3}dx\,,&lt;/math&gt;
or, using the &lt;math&gt;t = x^3&lt;/math&gt; substitution,
:&lt;math&gt; \langle r^k \rangle = a^k \int_{0}^{\infty}t^{k/3}e^{-t}dt = a^k \Gamma(1 + \frac{k}{3})\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]]. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle r^k \rangle = a^k \Gamma(1 + \frac{k}{3})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular,
:&lt;math&gt; \langle r \rangle = a \Gamma(\frac{4}{3}) = \frac{a}{3} \Gamma(\frac{1}{3}) \approx 0.893 a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''multiple audience dilemma''', also known as the '''multiple audience problem''', is a situation that arises when a singular person or group creates multiple images for themselves to present to separate audiences, and then the audiences meet; creating a need to personify different images of the same self without having others figure out what is happening.&lt;ref&gt;http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/vanboven/Publications_files/vanboven_map.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; This might happen through choosing to act in a specific way to convey a personality that matches both images of the self that both audiences are familiar with, as a way of compromising for both audiences without one or both.

==Studies==

One study conducted in 2000&lt;ref&gt;''When Social Worlds Collide:Overconfidence in the Multiple Audience Problem'', L. Kruger, K. Savitsky, and T. Gilovich&lt;/ref&gt; provides information to support the idea that the multiple audience dilemma is flawed. The study suggests that the task of entertaining multiple audiences at once is difficult and also shows that most participants were more convinced that they had performed a better job then what was actually portrayed. 
*The first part of this study, a single person had to portray themselves as either a party animal or a nerd in an isolated interview with two separate individuals and later was asked to maintain both images at once while being interviewed once more by the same people, without revealing to either audience members that the participant was performing. Then, the audience member scored what they thought of the participant after both encounters and the scores were compared afterwards. The participant did the task of portraying themselves while individually being interviewed and in the situation, but they performed better when they only had to think of one audience and how they actually performed was worse than how they felt they handled the situation.
*The second study focused on letting a group of five or six individuals become familiar with each other by having them talk to the group while answering questions for five minutes. Once everyone was familiar, the participants had to read an essay assigned to them and choose a keyword out of the assigned five words hidden in the essay, that then must be read to ten or twelve individuals, half being the familiar and the unfamiliar make up the rest of the group.The key of this task is to tell the participant's group what the keyword is, without telling the other group. The familiarized group felt like they would perform better because they knew each other, the results however showed to obvious changes, making both the familiar and unfamiliar groups equal at guessing the keyword. This however is only after knowing a person for a few moments and does not conclude that long term relationships will have the same results, due to learning each other's individual personalities rather than a five-minute familiarization session with a group of strangers.

The '''Murder of June Anne Devaney''' was the murder of a girl aged 3 years 11 months which occurred on 15 May 1948 in which June Anne Devaney was abducted from her cot while an [[inpatient]] at [[Queen's Park Hospital]] in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]]. She was removed to the grounds of the hospital, where she was [[rape]]d, before suffering extensive [[blunt force trauma]] to her skull by enduring her head being repeatedly swung into a sandstone wall. This assault caused the child to suffer extensive internal injuries and multiple [[skull fracture]]s, causing June Anne to develop a fatal state of [[acute stress reaction|shock]]. Her murderer, 22-year-old Peter Griffiths, was arrested three months after the crime. He was subsequently tried and convicted of June Anne's murder and was [[hanging|hanged]] on 19 November 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve the crime, police obtained the [[fingerprints]] of every male aged 16 and over who had been in the vicinity of Blackburn on the night of the murder to obtain the fingerprints of the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/foi-june2006.pdf |title=Freedom of Information: Records released as a result of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests|work= The National Archives|publisher= HM Government of the United Kingdom |format=PDF |date= June 2005|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation into the murder of June Anne Devaney would prove to be a milestone in the history of [[forensic science]]; this being the first time a mass [[fingerprinting]] exercise had been implemented to solve a murder in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html|title=The Fingerprint Society commemorates 60 years since landmark fingerprint identification|publisher=The Fingerprint Society|work=Fpsociety.org.uk|year=2008|accessdate=27 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306164019/http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sixty years of fingerprints|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7573433.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 September 2012|format=Video|date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/70263/history-first-mass-fingerprinting-operation ''mentalfloss.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
June Anne Devaney had been admitted to the [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|Queen's Park Hospital]] in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]] on 5 May 1948, to recover from a mild bout of [[pneumonia]]. She was placed in ward CH3 of the premises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/avalanche-journal-may-16-1948-p-1/ ''Avalanche Journal May 16, 1948'' p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after midnight on 15 May, nurse Gwendolyn Humphreys (who was in the ward's kitchen) heard a child's cry coming from the ward. She checked the ward, soothed the child and returned him to his cot, noting as she did so the child in the adjacent cot——June Anne Devaney —was sound asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then returned to her duties. At 1:20&amp;nbsp;am, she felt a draught and noticed an open door at the end of the ward. She closed it, and saw both that June Anne's cot was empty, and adult footprints—made by stockinged feet—were visible upon the highly waxed floor. Ominously, the drop side of the cot was still in place, meaning the child had to have been lifted from her cot.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurse Humphreys made a quick search of the ward, desperately attempting to find June Anne. After 30 minutes of fruitless searching, she contacted the local police. They arrived at 1:55&amp;nbsp;am and fully searched the hospital and its grounds, finding the child's body at 3:17&amp;nbsp;am. Her body lay face down in the grass alongside an {{convert|8|ft}} tall sandstone boundary wall some {{convert|300|ft|m}} from the ward,{{refn|group=n|The site where Devaney's body was discovered is now covered by the patients' car park of the [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital]]}} and immediately apparent were extensive bloodstains and tearing to her nightdress, numerous [[skull fracture]]s, and blood exuding from her nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basd.k12.wi.us/faculty/teverson/CASESTUDY--PETERGRIFFITHS.pdf ''Case Study: Peter Griffiths'']&lt;/ref&gt; The area where her body was discovered was promptly cordoned off, and at 4:20 a.m., the [[Chief Constable]] of Blackburn Police contacted [[Scotland Yard]], seeking the assistance of an experienced investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child's body bore extensive injuries consistent with bludgeoning, the hospital became a crime scene, and the ward was secured and searched. A subsequent [[post mortem]] revealed that June Anne had died of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] due to both extensive internal injuries and multiple skull fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal injuries were consistent with the child having been raped,&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and the multiple, extensive fractures and [[blunt force trauma]] to her skull had been inflicted from the child being repeatedly swung into the boundary wall while her rapist and murderer had held her by her legs, ankles, or feet.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Numerous teeth marks were also notable on her left buttock, and puncture wounds were found on one ankle. Considering the area where the body was discovered, plus soon being contacted by a taxi driver who informed police that he had picked up a man with a [[Lancashire dialect and accent|local accent]] close to the hospital on the night of the crime, Blackburn Police came to believe early in the investigation that the crime would very likely have been committed by a local person, or an individual with extensive local geographical knowledge.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

Beside Devaney's cot, a glass 1946 [[Boston round (bottle)|Winchester bottle]], partially filled with [[Water for injection|sterile water]], was found alongside further soiled footprints which were clearly visible on the highly polished hospital floor;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/a-brutal-murder-begins-an-unusual-investigation |title=A brutal murder begins an unusual investigation |publisher=History.com |work=This Day in History — 5/14/1948 |date= |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=5144&amp;language=eng|title= The Murder of June Anne Devaney|publisher= |work= Cottontown.org|first= Lorna|last= Woodruff|date= |accessdate= 27 September 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120404071143/http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?language=eng&amp;pageID=5144|archivedate= 4 April 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the pattern of these stockinged feet impressions evident throughout the ward revealed that June Anne's abductor and murderer had evidently removed his shoes after entering the premises before prowling throughout the ward to view each cot and bed before selecting June Anne's cot as the one from which he chose to abduct his victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basd.k12.wi.us/faculty/teverson/CASESTUDY--PETERGRIFFITHS.pdf ''Case Study: Peter Griffiths'']&lt;/ref&gt; The bottle itself had inexplicably been removed from its customary place (a trolley at the end of the ward) and placed beside the child's cot. This bottle itself was examined for fingerprints, being found to contain several sets.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
After all hospital staff had their fingerprints compared against those upon the bottle,{{refn|group=n|Initial comparison had begun with all persons with general access to the hospital itself—2,017 persons in all. Of these persons, 642 had specific access to the children's ward. All were checked, and all were eliminated from the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;}} a team of detectives from the [[Lancashire Constabulary]] traced all individuals who could have had a legitimate reason to have been in the ward within two years prior to the murder for the purposes of both [[alibi]] tracing, and fingerprint comparison, before all were eliminated as suspects. Following the completion of this exhaustive task, one unidentified set of fingerprints remained. This set of fingerprints was declared by the head of the Lancashire Fingerprint Bureau to have belonged to the child's murderer.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

After first establishing that no match for this set of fingerprints could be found within the police fingerprint bureau—meaning the perpetrator had not previously been convicted of any crime—attention turned to every male at or over the age of 16 within the local community. In a joint effort between local police forces and senior detectives from Scotland Yard, the [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Chief Inspector]] in charge of the investigation, DCI John Capstick, then proposed that every male at or over the age of 16 who lived or was in the vicinity of Blackburn (then a town of 123,000 inhabitants) between 14 and 15 May be fingerprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public were asked to cooperate with police throughout this undertaking, with the promise that all records obtained would not be compared for usage in other cases, and that these records would be destroyed at the completion of this task.{{refn|group=n|All records obtained were destroyed just weeks prior to the execution of the perpetrator of the crime. They would be destroyed in a mass [[Pulp (paper)|pulping]] exercise at a local [[papermill]], with the local press present to record the destruction of the records.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;}}

The mass operation began, and a special card was developed so that the identifiable sections of the perpetrator's left hand found upon the bottle (the left [[forefinger]], [[middle finger]], [[ring finger]] and a section of the left palm) could be recorded swiftly. The card also recorded the individual's name, address, and [[National Identity Registration Number]]. Also on the card was a section pertaining to the individual's movements between 11 p.m. on 14 May and 2 a.m. 15 May.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/1939-register-service |title=1939 Register Service |publisher=NHS Information Centre |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109164823/http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/1939-register-service |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task-force to carry out this endeavour was led by Inspector W. Barton and comprised a team of 20 officers who, armed with details from the [[Electoral Register]], set about the districts collecting fingerprints and comparing them against those upon the Winchester bottle. Over the course of two months, over 40,000 sets of prints were taken from more than 35,000 homes without a match being found.{{refn|group=n|Such was the level of public outrage generated by the murder of June Anne Devaney, that throughout the duration of this mammoth task, only very seldom did officers encounter a refusal by a member of the public to submit his fingerprints for comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle. On the rare instance a member of the public did refuse to give his fingerprints, this individual was visited by a senior police officer, who in each instance, succeeded in obtaining the individual's fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Upon completion of this exercise in late July, police then concentrated on people who had not been listed upon the Electoral Register. By way of checking the issue of [[Rationing|ration books]] and the Registration Number of the individual by which they and their owners were identified, officers began tracing all male individuals whose fingerprints had not yet been collected.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
One of the Blackburn addresses to be checked on 11 August was that of Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman who lived in Briley Street, and who worked as a packer on the night shift at a local flour mill. When asked to provide his fingerprints for comparison, Griffiths—whose niece had been in Queen's Park Hospital at the time June Anne had been abducted&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;—supplied them without hesitation.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; At 3:00 p.m. on 12 August, a comparison for the fingerprints upon the Winchester bottle was made with the fingerprints obtained from Peter Griffiths.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

By the time this comparison had been made, officers had taken 46,253 sets of fingerprints, and had less than 200 sets of prints left to check before the completion of their task.

==Arrest==
Peter Griffiths was arrested by DCI Capstick as he left his Blackburn home to attend work on the evening of 12 August.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to Blackburn Police Headquarters, where he was formally [[Police caution|cautioned]] as to his right to silence. During the ride to police headquarters, and throughout his first interview, Griffiths attempted to deny any involvement,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; although when confronted with the fact his fingerprints had been a perfect match for those upon the bottle, he turned towards DCI Capstick and stated: "Well, if they are my fingerprints on the bottle, I'll tell you all about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
In the statement he subsequently gave to detectives, Griffiths claimed that on the night of the 14th, he had chosen to go for a night's "drinking alone" in Blackburn, and that as a result of his heavy drinking, by [[Last call (bar term)|closing time]], he had become severely [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]].{{refn|group=n|Griffiths claimed to have drank at least 11 pints of [[Bitter (beer)|bitter]], two double [[Shot glass|shots]] of rum,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and one pint of [[Guinness]] on the night he killed June Anne Devaney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had then chosen to walk around in an attempt to "[[Sobriety|sober up]]" before returning home. Griffiths then claimed to have spoken with a man in a parked car, whom he had asked to light his (Griffiths') cigarette. According to Griffiths, this man, noting his state of intoxication, had said to him: "Get in, open the window and I'll give you a spin."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; This man had soon parked his car in close proximity to Queen's Park Hospital, and it had been at this stage at which Griffiths had chosen to break into the premises to commit his crime.{{refn|group=n|This claim to have been offered a lift by an unknown stranger in a car was called into question by a taxi driver who informed investigators that on the night of the murder, he had given a lift to a man matching Griffith's description, who had specifically requested to be driven to a quarry located adjacent to the Queen's Park Hospital. This taxi driver's account, if correct, suggests the murder of June Anne was [[premeditation|premeditated]] from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;''Real-Life Crimes'' (1993) ISSN 9-771354-950013&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had, he stated, picked up the Winchester bottle to use as a weapon in the event any member of staff had attempted to challenge him after he had entered the premises, before he had chosen June Anne as his victim.

Griffiths refused to talk in much detail as to the atrocities he inflicted upon the child, beyond claiming that he had killed June Anne in a fit of rage when she had begun crying after he had carried her from the premises. Nonetheless, in one section of his statement, Griffiths stated that as he had carried the child across the field to where he assaulted and murdered her, June Anne had trustingly placed her arms around his neck. Although he showed no remorse for his actions (which he blamed upon his state of intoxication) throughout the course of his confession, he did end his formal statement with a sentence indicating he wished to be [[hanging|hanged]] for his crime: "I hope I get what I deserve."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 13 August, Peter Griffiths was formally charged with the murder of June Anne Devaney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond providing investigators with a further set of his fingerprints and foot impressions for additional comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle and upon the floor of the ward of the Queen's Park Hospital, he would refuse to cooperate with all subsequent requests either to discuss aspects of his crime, or to provide blood or pubic hair samples for additional comparison with samples obtained at the crime scene prior to his upcoming trial; simply making statements to the effect of, "I don't wish to say anything" when these requests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Griffiths' confession, he was immediately [[remand (court procedure)|remanded into custody]] at [[HM Prison Liverpool|Walton Gaol]] to await trial.

To both substantiate Griffiths' confession, and to garner further evidence, investigators went to his house to conduct a thorough search. During this search, a ticket was found from a local [[pawnbroker]], dated 31 May 1948, for a suit belonging to Griffiths. Police collected this suit, only for the police forensics laboratory to discover that it bore bloodstains in several locations on both the jacket and trousers. These bloodstains were found to be the same blood type of June Anne Devaney—[[ABO blood group system|type A]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, fibres from this suit proved to be a perfect match to fibres found upon the child's body, clothing, and the window ledge where her murderer had entered the hospital,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; thus proving this to have been the suit Griffiths had been wearing on the night of the crime.

==Trial==
The trial of Peter Griffiths began on 15 October 1948. He was tried before Mr. Justice Oliver at the [[assizes|assize court]] of [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster]],&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt; and chose to enter a formal plea of [[plea|not guilty]] to the charge of murder on this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those to testify on behalf of the prosecution was Inspector Colin Campbell, who testified as to the prints on the Winchester bottle being a precise match for the samples Griffiths had twice provided for investigators, and which he readily acknowledged were his own. To demonstrate this, enlarged copies of both sets of fingerprints were displayed to the jury, with Inspector Campbell indicating 16 ridge characteristics which were in agreement on both sets of impressions. Inspector Campbell also testified as to the stockinged feet impressions Griffiths had provided for investigators also being remarkably similar in characteristics with those found upon the ward from which June Anne had been abducted. Also to testify on behalf of the prosecution were individuals who described how the suit Griffiths had pawned shortly after the murder was found to be heavily bloodstained in several locations on both the jacket and trousers, and that these bloodstains were of the same blood type of June Anne Devaney. The jurors were told how fibres from this suit were of a perfect match to fibres found on the child's clothing, body, and on the window ledge where her murderer had evidently entered the hospital. None of these experts were [[cross-examination|cross-examined]] by Griffiths' defence counsel.

During the trial, Griffiths' defence counsel openly stated they were not fighting for his freedom, but for his life (murder being a [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital offence]] in the United Kingdom at the time). As Griffiths had already pleaded guilty to the offence,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; all that remained was a question of his sanity, and as such, the defence had entered a plea of [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. This opinion was voiced by Dr. Alaistair Robertson Grant, who stated for the defence that Griffiths was displaying the early signs of [[schizophrenia]] (a condition for which he had treated Griffiths' father some thirty years previously when he had been hospitalised with the condition). Dr. Grant stated to the jury that although Griffiths knew what he was doing, he did not realise the criminality of his actions. To refute this testimony, the prosecution produced the medical officer from Walton Gaol, a Dr. F.H. Brisby. Dr. Brisby testified on 18 October as to his observations of Griffiths while he had been held on [[remand (detention)|remand]] since 14 August. He stated that, based on his observations of Griffiths throughout his incarceration, Griffiths was sane when he had committed the crime.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

During the trial, Griffiths described how he had entered the hospital while intoxicated, and had then picked up the Winchester sterile water bottle, which he stated to the Court he had intended to use as a weapon if he was challenged. He also described how he had lifted June Anne Devaney from her cot and then carried her, in his right arm, out of the hospital, down the field to where he had proceeded to beat and rape her, adding that the child had trustingly placed her arms around his neck as he had carried her to this destination. Although he confessed to having swung the child's head into the boundary wall approximately four times, Griffiths made no response when he was specifically asked about the sexual aspect of the assault. (After hearing Griffiths' recollection of the events, Dr. Alaistair Grant privately conceded that Griffiths was of [[Sanity|sound mind]].&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;)

The trial lasted for two days. Following [[closing argument]]s delivered by both counsels, the jury retired to consider their verdict, although they would deliberate for just 23 minutes&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; before announcing they had reached their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Griffiths was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of June Anne Devaney's murder. In response to this verdict, Mr. Justice Oliver donned his formal [[black cap]] and made the following speech:

{{cquote|Peter Griffiths, this jury has found you guilty of a crime of the most brutal ferocity. I entirely agree with their verdict. The sentence of the Court is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence to a place of execution, and that you there suffer death by hanging [...] and may the Lord have mercy on your soul.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;}}

Peter Griffiths did not lodge an appeal against his conviction. He was hanged at [[HM Prison Liverpool|Liverpool Prison]] on 19 November 1948. His body was later buried within the confines of the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishexecutions.co.uk/execution-content.php?key=751 |title=Peter Griffiths - 1948 |publisher=BritishExecutions.co.uk |date=19 November 1948 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Musical saw 2.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|A busker playing a musical saw in Prague]]

A '''musical saw''', also called a '''singing saw''', is a [[hand saw]] used as a [[musical instrument]]. Capable of continuous [[glissando]] ([[portamento]]), the sound creates an ethereal tone, very similar to the [[theremin]]. The musical saw is classified as a plaque friction [[idiophone]] with direct friction (132.22) under the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] system of [[musical instrument classification]].

==Playing==
{{Quote|[The musical saw is] a flexible handsaw played by holding the handle between the knees and bending the blade while bowing along the flat edge. The musical saw is found in the folk music of Russia and rural America, and is a popular vaudeville instrument.&lt;ref name="Nardolillo"&gt;Nardolillo, Jo (2014). ''All Things Strings'', pg. 90. Scarecrow; {{ISBN|9780810884441}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The saw is generally played seated with the handle squeezed between the legs, and the far end held with one hand. Some sawists play standing, either with the handle between the knees and the blade sticking out in front of them. The saw is usually played with the serrated edge, or "teeth", facing the body, though some players face them away. Some saw players file down the teeth which makes no discernable difference to the sound. Many—especially professional—saw players use a handle, called a Cheat, at the tip of the saw for easier bending and higher virtuosity.

To sound a note, a sawist first bends the blade into an S-curve. The parts of the blade that are curved are damped from vibration, and do not sound. At the center of the S-curve a section of the blade remains relatively flat. This section, the "sweet spot", can vibrate across the width of the blade, producing a distinct [[pitch (music)|pitch]]: the wider the section of blade, the lower the sound. Sound is usually created by drawing a [[Bow (music)|bow]] across the back edge of the saw at the sweet spot, or sometimes by striking the sweet spot with a mallet. 

The sawist controls the pitch by adjusting the S-curve, making the sweet spot travel up the blade (toward a thinner width) for a higher pitch, or toward the handle for a lower pitch. [[Harmonic]]s can be created by playing at varying distances on either side of the sweet spot. Sawists can add [[vibrato]] by shaking one of their legs or by wobbling the hand that holds the tip of the blade. Once a sound is produced, it will [[sustain]] for quite a while, and can be carried through several [[Musical note|note]]s of a [[phrase (music)|phrase]].

On occasion the musical saw is called for in orchestral music, but orchestral percussionists are seldom also sawists.  If a note outside of the saw's range is called for, an electric guitar with a slide can be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Peinkofer and Fritz Tannigel, Handbook of Percussion Instruments, (Mainz, Germany: Schott, 1976), pg. 75.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Sawists often use standard wood-cutting saws, although special musical saws are also made. As compared with wood-cutting saws, the blades of musical saws are generally wider, for [[range (music)|range]], and longer, for finer control. They do not have set or sharpened teeth, and may have grain running parallel to the back edge of the saw, rather than parallel to the teeth. Some musical saws are made with thinner metal, to increase flexibility, while others are made thicker, for a richer [[timbre|tone]], longer sustain, and stronger harmonics. 

A typical musical saw is {{Convert|5|in|cm}} wide at the handle end and {{Convert|1|in|cm}} wide at the tip. Such a saw will generally produce about two [[octave]]s, regardless of length. A bass saw may be over {{Convert|6|in|cm}} at the handle and produce about two-and-a-half octaves. There are also musical saws with 3–4 octaves range, and new improvements have resulted in as much as 5 octaves note range. Two-person saws, also called "misery whips", can also be played, though with less virtuosity, and they produce an octave or less of range.

Most sawists use cello or violin bows, using violin [[rosin]], but some may use improvised home-made bows, such as a wooden dowel.

==Producers==
Musical saws have been produced for over a century, primarily in the United States, but also in Scandinavia, Germany, France (Lame sonore) and Asia.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== United States ===
In the early 1900s, there were at least ten companies in the United States manufacturing musical saws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawlady.com/DifferentSaws.htm|title=Musical Saw manufacturers|website=Sawlady.com|last = Paruz|first = Natalia|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These saws ranged from the familiar steel variety to gold-plated masterpieces worth hundreds of dollars. However, with the start of World War II the demand for metals made the manufacture of saws too expensive and many of these companies went out of business. By the year 2000, only three companies in the United States—Mussehl &amp; Westphal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalsaws.com/|title=The World's Finest Musical Saws - Anyone Can Play - Mussehl &amp; Westphal|website=Musical Saws|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie Blacklock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blacklocksaws.com|title=Home - Charlie Blacklock Musical Saws|website=Home - Charlie Blacklock Musical Saws|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wentworth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalsaw.com/|title=Singing Saw - Musical Saws For Sale - Easiest Instrument To Learn|website=Musical Saw - Singing Saw|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—were making saws.  In 2012, a company called Index Drums started producing a saw that had a built-in [[transducer]] in the handle, called the "JackSaw".&lt;ref&gt;[http://indexdrums.com/jacksaw "The JackSaw" amplified musical saw] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804054223/http://indexdrums.com/jacksaw|date=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marlene Dietrich===
German actress and singer [[Marlene Dietrich]], who lived and worked in the United States for a long time, is probably the most well known musical saw player. When she studied the violin for one year in Weimar in her early twenties, her musical skills were already evident. Some years later she learned to play the musical saw while she was shooting the film "Café Electric" in Vienna in 1927. Her colleague, the Bavarian actor and musician Igo Sym told her how to play. In the shooting breaks and at weekends both performed romantic duets, he at the piano and she at the musical saw.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Spoto: ''Marlene Dietrich.'' Heyne Verlag, München 1992, pg. 61.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sym gave his saw to her as a farewell gift. The following words are engraved on the saw: "Now Suidy is gone / the sun d’ont [sic!] / shine… / Igo / Vienna 1927"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/EN/Objects/dietrich-singende-saege-en.html?single=1|title=Objects - Marlene Dietrich’s Musical Saw|first=|last=|website=kuenste-im-exil.de|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She took the saw with her, when she left for Hollywood in 1929 and played there in the following years at film sets and Hollywood parties.
When she participated at the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) shows for the US troops in 1944, she also played on the saw. Some of these shows were broadcast on radio, so there exist two rare recordings of her saw playing, embedded in entertaining interviews. 1. Aloha Oe&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMLG5iqh5c0 Marlene Dietrich performing "Aloha oe" on the musical saw]"&lt;/ref&gt;  2. other song&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo97E2H2Ec8|title=Marlene Dietrich Plays Her Musical Saw! 1948|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=31 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composers and compositions==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2018}}
Beginning from the early 1920s composers of both contemporary and popular music wrote for the musical saw.
Probably the first was [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].  He included the musical saw, e.g., in the film music for ''[[The New Babylon]]'' (1929), in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' (1928),&lt;ref name="Nardolillo"/&gt; and in ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'' (1934).
Shostakovich and other composers of his time used the term "Flexaton" to mark the musical saw. "Flexaton" just means "to flex a tone"—the saw is flexed to change the pitch. Unfortunately, there exists another instrument called [[Flexatone]], so there has been confusion for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singende-saege.com/shostakovich-the-nose.html|title=Flexaton / Musical saw in Shostakovich's opera "The nose" - Katharina Micada - Singende Säge|first=Katharina|last=Micada|website=Singende-saege.com|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aram Khachaturian]], who knew Shostakovich's music included the musical saw in his [[Piano Concerto (Khachaturian)|Piano Concerto]] (1936)&lt;ref name="Nardolillo"/&gt; in the second movement. Another composer was the Swiss [[Arthur Honegger]], who included the saw in his opera ''[[Antigone (Honegger)|Antigone]]'' in 1924 . 
The Romanian composer [[George Enescu]] used the musical saw at the end of the second act of his opera ''[[Œdipe (opera)| Œdipe]]'' (1931) to show in an extensive glissando—which begins with the mezzo-soprano and is continued by the saw—the death and ascension of the sphinx killed by Oedipus.
The Italian composer [[Giacinto Scelsi]] wrote a part for the saw in his quarter-tone piece ''Quattro pezzi per orchestra'' (1959). German composer [[Hans Werner Henze]] took the saw to characterize the mean hero of his tragical opera ''[[Elegy for young lovers]]'' (1961).&lt;br/&gt;
Other composers were [[Krysztof Penderecki]] with ''Fluorescences'' (1961), ''De natura sonoris Nr. 2'' (1971) and the opera ''[[Ubu Rex]]'' (1990), [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] with ''Stille und Umkehr'' (1970), [[George Crumb]] with ''[[Ancient voices of children]]'' (1970), [[John Corigliano]] with ''[[The Mannheim Rocket]]'' (2001).&lt;br/&gt;
[[Chaya Czernowin]] used the saw in her opera "PNIMA...Ins Innere" (2000) to represent the character of the grandfather, who is traumatized by the Holocaust.&lt;br/&gt; 
There are Further [[Leif Segerstam]], [[Hans Zender]] (orchestration of "5 préludes" by Claude Debussy), [[Franz Schreker]] (opera ''Christophorus'') and [[Oscar Strasnoy]] (opera ''Le bal'').&lt;br/&gt;
Russian composer [[Lera Auerbach]] wrote for the saw in her ballet ''The Little Mermaid'' (2005), in her symphonic poem ''Dreams and Whispers of Poseidon'' (2005), in her oratorio "Requiem Dresden – Ode to Peace" (2012), in her Piano Concerto No.1 (2015), in her comic oratorio ''The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie'' (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikorski.de/10619/en/new_work_the_infant_minstrel_and_his_peculiar_menagerie_by_lera_auerbach_in_bergen.html|title=The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie|author=Lera Auerbach|website=Sikorski.de|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her violin concerto Nr.4 "NyX – Fractured dreams" (2017).

In [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], a '''mutant''' is a human being that possesses a [[genetics|genetic trait]] called the X-gene. It causes the mutant to  develop [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman powers]] that manifest at [[puberty]]. Human mutants are sometimes referred to as a human subspecies '''''Homo sapiens superior,''''' or simply '''''Homo superior.''''' Mutants are the [[evolution]]ary progeny of ''Homo sapiens'', and are generally assumed to be the next stage in [[human evolution]].  The accuracy of this is the subject of much debate in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Unlike Marvel's [[Mutate (comics)|mutates]], which are characters who develop their powers only after exposure to outside stimuli or energies (such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Spider-Man]], [[The Fantastic Four]], and [[Absorbing Man]]), mutants have actual [[Mutation|genetic mutations]].

==Background==
A March 1952 story in ''Amazing Detective Cases'' #11 called "The Weird Woman" tells of a woman describing herself as a mutant who seeks a similarly superhuman mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/weirdwomanadc.htm |title="Weird Woman" (1950s, Amazing Detective Case) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Carstairs, a mutant who can create illusions, is shown in ''Man Comics'' #28, dated September 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/carstairsrogermm.htm |title=Roger Carstairs (Bob Brant &amp; the Trouble-Shooters foe) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character with superhuman powers, born from a radiation-exposed parent, was seen in "The Man with the Atomic Brain!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/lestrontedjim.htm |title=Ted Lestron (pre-FF mutant) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #52 in May 1959; although not specifically called a "mutant", his origin is consistent with one.

A little-known story in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #6 (November 1959) titled "The Mutants and Me!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/farnsworthvincenttos.htm |title=Vincent Farnsworth (Pre-FF mutant, Tales of Suspense) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first Marvel (then known as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas]]) stories to feature a named "mutant".

Tad Carter,  a mutant with [[telekinetic]] powers, is shown in Amazing Adult Fantasy #14, dated July 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/carter-tad.htm|title=Tad Carter (Promise member)|publisher=Marvunapp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of mutants as an independent subspecies was created and utilized by Marvel editor/writer [[Stan Lee]] in the early 1960s, as a means to create a large number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s without having to think of a separate origin for each one. As part of the concept, Lee decided that these mutant teenagers should, like ordinary ones, attend school in order to better cope with the world, in this case [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. These mutants first appeared in the superhero series ''X-Men'', which debuted in 1963. Marvel later introduced several additional mutant superhero teams, including [[New Mutants|The New Mutants]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], [[X-Force]], and [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]].

Officially, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] is considered the first mutant superhero whom Marvel Comics ever published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/ |title=Namor |publisher=comicvine.com |date=1922-02-22 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; debuting in [[1939 in comics|1939]]. However, Namor was not actually described as a mutant until decades after his first appearance. The same is true of [[Toro (comics)|Toro]], partner of the [[Human Torch (android)|android Human Torch]] introduced in 1940.

===Omega-level mutants===
&lt;!-- The list that is currently present is sufficient for the purposes of this article. Please do NOT add characters, even if a reference is supplied. --&gt;
An '''Omega-level mutant''' is one with the most powerful genetic potential of their mutant abilities. The term was first seen in the 1986 issue ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #208, but was completely unexplained beyond the obvious implication of it referring to an exceptional level of power. The term was not seen again until the 2001 limited series ''[[X-Men Forever]]''. Some abilities depicted by mutants described as Omega-level include [[immortality]], reality warping, highly destructive energy projection, extreme manipulation of [[matter]], [[energy]], [[time]] and [[space]], high [[psionic]] ability with strong [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]], and the potential to exist beyond the boundaries of the known physical universe. No firm definition has been offered in comics. Examples of mutants that have been confirmed as Omega-level include [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Men: The 198]]'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Forever'' by [[Professor X]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperstorm]], [[Nate Grey]], [[Stryfe]], [[Mister M (comics)|Mister M]], [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Quentin Quire]],&lt;ref name="New X-Men #137"&gt;''New X-Men'' #137 (April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]],&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' by [[Emma Frost]], ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #477&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Summers]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #207 by [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceman (character)|Iceman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=17883 |title=Carey on "Manifest Destiny" and "X-Men Origins: Beast" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Mutants]]'' v2. by Christina Weir&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Psylocke]].&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=35905 |title=COMMENTARY TRACK: "Uncanny X-Force" #18 with Rick Remender |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''"Homo superior superior"''===
Introduced in [[Chris Claremont]]'s ''X-Treme X-Men'', a character known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] claims to be humanity's natural response to mutants.  Vargas was born at the epitome of peak physical skill, having superhuman levels of strength, speed, reflexes, agility, stamina, and durability.  Vargas also seems to be immune to various mutant abilities (such as Rogue's absorption and Psylocke's telekinetic blast).&lt;ref&gt;X-Treme X-Men #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Externals===
Created by [[Rob Liefeld]], [[Externals]] are immortal mutants whose powers have allowed them to exist for centuries. Eventually, most of the Externals are killed by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]], Selene, and [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] are examples of Externals.

===Cheyarafim and Neyaphem===
Cheyarafim and Neyaphem first appear in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #429. According to the character [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], the Cheyarafim are a group of [[angel]]-like mutants who were the traditional enemies of the Neyaphem, a demonic-looking group of mutants who lived in [[Biblical]] times. The Cheyarafim were [[Fanaticism|fanatic]]s who had a strict, absolutist view of morality which led them into conflict with the Neyaphem. This escalated into a [[religious war|holy war]], causing the Neyaphem to be exiled into an alternate dimension. What happened to the Cheyarafim after this has not been revealed.

The X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is said to be descended from Cheyarafim,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} while [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] is supposedly the son of a Neyaphem, Azazel. It is unknown if Joshua Guthrie, known as [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]], is a descendant of the Cheyarafim.

===Dominant Species/lupine===
[[Maximus Lobo]] claims to be a part of a mutant sub-species of feral, wolf-like mutants, whom he calls the Dominant Species. He later tries to recruit [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]] into his ranks, to no avail.  A few years later, another mutant, [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]], claims that some human mutants evolved from canines instead of primates. Mutants who are a part of this group include Romulus, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Daken]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Thornn (comics)|Thornn]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], and [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], with [[X-23]] and the [[Native (comics)|Native]] as other likely candidates. These groups appear to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=1125 |title=Uncanny X-Men Vol. 2: Dominant Species | work = Marvel Comics Catalog |publisher=Marvel.com |date= 21 May 2003 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changelings===
Introduced in the second series of ''X-Factor'', a '''changeling''' is a mutant whose powers manifest at birth.  Jamie Madrox ([[Multiple Man]]) and [[Damian Tryp]] are examples of this sub-class.

===Extraterrestrial mutants===
Humans are not the only species to have mutant subspecies.  [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]], [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], [[Cerise (comics)|Cerise]], [[Ultra Girl]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] are examples of mutant aliens.

==Mutants as metaphor==
{{Main|X-Men#Reflecting social issues}}
As a fictional [[oppression|oppressed]] [[minority group|minority]], mutants are often used as extended [[metaphor]]s for real-world people and situations. In 1982, ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] said, "[mutants] are hated, feared and despised collectively by humanity for no other reason than that they are mutants. So what we have here, intended or not, is a book that is about racism, bigotry and prejudice."{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Danny Fingeroth]] writes extensively in his book ''Superman on the Couch'' about the appeal of mutants and their meaning to society:

{{quote|The most popular pop culture franchises are those that make the viewer/reader feel special and unique, while simultaneously making him or her feel he or she is part of a mass of people experiencing and enjoying the same phenomenon. The plight of the mutants is universally compelling. Many people feel a need for a surrogate family, one composed of those the world has abused and persecuted in the same way they have been their whole life. This is especially true in adolescents, which may in part explain some of the draw of mutants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Danny Fingeroth|Fingeroth, Danny]]. ''Superman On The Couch: What Superheroes Really Tell Us About Ourselves and Society'', Continuum, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8264-1540-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An obvious parallel between homosexuality and mutation is drawn in the feature film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', where [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]'s mother asks, "Have you tried ''not'' being a mutant?"  This question (or various forms thereof) is common among parents who find out their children are [[gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M/C Journal: Have You Tried Not Being a Mutant?  |url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0710/10-mantle.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The X-Men "Come out:" Being a "Mutant" in films can be seen as a metaphor for homosexuality  |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12956661/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', Hank McCoy (later known as [[Beast (X-Men)|Beast]]), upon being outed to a colleague as a mutant, responds, "[[Don't Ask Don't Tell|You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.]]"


In his article ''Super Heroes, a Modern Mythology'', Richard Reynolds writes:

{{quote|Much of the appeal and draw of the mutants that comprise the [[X-Men]] has to do with feeling like an outcast while simultaneously feeling like part of a family. Mutants are ostracized because they are different but they bound together because of their differences. They may be forced together to a certain extent like 'real' families but they are also a team. They differ from other teams such as the [[Justice League]], which is like a meritocracy; only the best of the best join that team. In contrast, the X-Men is composed of outcasts. They train and nurture one another and are united by common goals and beliefs. ...the whole theme of the X-Men — the isolation of mutants and their alienation from 'normal' society — may be read as a parable of the alienation of any minority... of a minority grouping determined to force its own place within society.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}}}

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
Within the ''[[Earth X]]'' universe, the powers of the vast majority of Marvel's human superheroes were revealed to have been the result of genetic manipulation by the [[Celestials]] millions of years in the past.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe within the pages of the ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'' #1, it is revealed that super-powered "mutants" were artificially created via [[genetic modification]] by the [[Weapon X]] program in a laboratory in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] in October 1943. The project was an attempt to produce a [[supersoldier]], inspired by the existence of [[Captain America]]. [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|James Howlett]] was the first individual to be so modified. At some later point, possibly during a confrontation between Magneto and his parents, the mutant trigger was released into the environment worldwide, leading to the appearance of mutants in the general population. Following the events of the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline, information concerning the origins of mutancy was made public and steps were taken in the US to make being a mutant illegal. While the move apparently has majority support among the non-mutant population, a vocal minority has voiced concern that it will lead to witch-hunts and genocide.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Origins'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34349">The '''Nazareth-Conferences''' were the beginning of a project of [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] from England, Israel and Germany, whose founding fathers and mothers&lt;ref name="r-01" /&gt; intended to contribute to a process of solving [[Conflict theories|conflicts]] that developed between national groups. The causes of these conflicts were supposed in collective prejudices and [[resentment]]s. The aim of the conferences was – and still is for the follow-up projects&lt;ref name="r-02" /&gt; –, to become aware of these [[prejudice]]s and resentments and – at best – to give them up. [[Desmond Tutu]] compared the conferences in his foreword&lt;ref name="r-03" /&gt; for the English and German edition of the book about the Nazareth-Conferences&lt;ref name="r-04" /&gt; with the [[Truth and reconciliation commission]] set up after the end of [[Apartheid]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name="r-05" /&gt;

== History ==
There are long paths that individual psychoanalysts and their representative organizations – joined in the [[International Psychoanalytical Association|International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA)]] – had to go until the first of the three conferences under the name ''Nazareth-Conferences'' could be held in 1994. The roots go back to the year 1934 when [[Max Eitingon]] after his flight from Germany founded the Palestinian, today ''Israel Psychoanalytic Society''.&lt;ref name="r-06" /&gt; From their ranks came some of the founders of these conferences.&lt;ref name="r-07" /&gt;

A second line of the story of the project began 1957 in England. There the [[Tavistock Institute]]&lt;ref name="r-08" /&gt; started to develop the later so-called Leicesterconferences,&lt;ref name="r-09" /&gt; an “empirical experiment on group relations” – partly with psychoanalytic concepts, partly with those of the “theory of open systems”.&lt;ref name="r-10" /&gt;

1977 the congress of the IPA&lt;ref name="r-11" /&gt; for the first time after the war and the period of [[Nazism]] was held in Jerusalem. The occurrences at the congress activated in Germany and Israel processes of reflection and discussion that in 1985 should have visible consequences in both countries. In Jerusalem 1977 the German group suffered a grievous experienced rejection of their desire, to hold a next congress in Berlin – also for the first time after the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] –, but made use of this offense for an intensive process of [[Introspection|self-reflection]]. At its beginning there was the insight in the “illusion of an innocent tradition and [[Psychoanalysis#History|history]]”.&lt;ref name="r-12" /&gt; The result was presented at the 34th congress of the IPA 1985 in Hamburg in an accompanying exhibition that traced the self-reflective process.&lt;ref name="r-13" /&gt;

In the same year in Israel ''OFEK''&lt;ref name="r-14" /&gt; was  founded as a result of striving for self-knowledge after the Jerusalem congress: an organization dedicated to the study of group processes using the [[Socio-analysis#Group relations theory and Tavistock conferences|Leicesterconferences]].&lt;ref name="r-09" /&gt; With support and under the direction of Eric Miller from the ''Tavistock Institute'' in London own group relation conferences were established with the ''OFEK'' in Israel.

Soon after the IPA-Congress 1985 in Hamburg and stimulated by it, Rafael Moses&lt;ref name="r-15" /&gt; and his wife Rina Moses Hrushevski in Israel suggested a research group that should initiate reflexive processes of both groups in the presence of each other. The decision to enter into this venture and to start the project fell in the apartment of the couple Moses as [[Shmuel Erlich]], who was there at the time, mentioned.&lt;ref name="r-01" /&gt; But a further 9 years – and the failure of a first attempt – went by before the first conference in 1994 finally was held in [[Nazareth]].

As some participants painfully were missing the German Jews on the first and second conference, Shmuel Erlich as a native Frankfurter turned to them in an open letter 1999, shortly before the third conference,  encouraging them to participate.&lt;ref name="r-16" /&gt;

The long way of the German psychoanalysts in these conferences were according to Hermann Beland&lt;ref name="r-17" /&gt; on one hand caused by the “still collectively effective” defence of the Germans against a visualization of the Holocaust and on the other hand the lack of “convincing insight into the insanity, into why the Germans wanted this” (the Holocaust, author's note).&lt;ref name="r-18" /&gt; In detail he described the delusions and confusions – his own and of part of the German group –, which finally led to an involvement in this project. Since 1922 it took a long time until 2007 that a congress of the IPA in Berlin was possible again.&lt;ref name="r-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r-20" /&gt;

[[File:Platres village (Cyprus).JPG|right|thumb|Conference site since 2004 in Platres/Cyprus]] 
Director of ''staff'' called supervisors group&lt;ref name="r-21" /&gt; for the first three conferences 1994 and 1996 in Nazareth and 2000 in Bad Segeberg/Germany was [[Eric Miller (social scientist)|Eric Miller]]. His unexpected death in 2002&lt;ref name="r-22" /&gt; led to a turning point, as well as in the same year the death of Rafael Moses, who was staff-member from the beginning. At [[Cyprus]] they went on in 2004 with the fourth and in 2006 with the fifth conference: under a new name, a new design and with Anton Obholzer&lt;ref name="r-23" /&gt; as a new director. 2007 ''PCCA''&lt;ref name="r-02" /&gt; was founded – ''Partners in Confronting Collective Atrocities'' –, a non-profit organization with which the founders of ''Nazareth-Conferences'' have given themselves an outward visible structure.&lt;ref name="r-24" /&gt; Since 2008 ''PCCA'' took over the leadership for the conferences.&lt;ref name="r-25" /&gt; In the same year for the first time [[Palestinians]] participated and in the subsequent 2010 Conference they were represented in staff with Nimer Said.

== Task and Design ==
The title of the three ''Nazareth-Conferences'' – “Germans and Israelis: The Past in the Present”&lt;ref name="r-26" /&gt; –, was its program. It spoke of two national groups and suggested to recognize the past of the relationship between the two target groups in the present. Thus, the conferences were able to become a place where individual and group identities could meet and where was given the opportunity to explore the chances and risks of such an encounter. The task was to find out how the current relationship to the other group was influenced by belonging to the own and how the presence of this ratio was influenced by the past. Although it was intended, thereby also to detect the underlying, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious fantasies]], the target was not therapeutic, but learning at the moment of encounter. To address this difficult task undisturbed by the everyday life of the participants, the design of conferences&lt;ref name="r-27" /&gt; presented a secure framework. Members and staff lived together in a house and worked for six days in the topic. Conference language was English. The use of one's own national language was permissible, but only if all those present dominated this language. Through all this, it gradually should be possible to perceive one's own role, which was taken at the conference in the presence of others, and explore how this role was affected by past and current psychological and social processes.

As the conferences were assessed from the outset as a bold and risky venture and planned by psychoanalysts,&lt;ref name="r-28" /&gt; the invitation first was directed to a kind of closed society: over various psychoanalytic associations and societies to their members.&lt;ref name="r-29" /&gt; This changed later. Participants were members of the “groups in conflict” and members of staff. The staff's purpose was the management of the conference, he took over the responsibility for the frame, thus securing the boundaries of space, time and task; he presented consultants systematic or if necessary and was called for, and offered working hypotheses about what just happened. In the same time the staff was not an external observer, but as participating individuals and as a group involved in the entire process.

The participants came, as it turned out, not only from Germany and Israel, so that the division of the world in the title appeared as a “fantasy on the part of the planners”.&lt;ref name="r-30" /&gt; The largest age group was built by the so-called second-generation members. But some members of the preliminary and some of the subsequent generation were represented.

Although Germans and Israelis were invited for participation, they often felt poorly perceived in their identity by these attributes.&lt;ref name="r-31" /&gt; The question of identity was central,&lt;ref name="r-32" /&gt; particularly for Israelis, because this question was the one that in the past had decided who was allowed to live. Everyone involved knew what finally found words: “Our parents would sit here together”.&lt;ref name="r-33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r-34" /&gt;

== Structure and Technique ==
The individual participants with their history stood only apparently in the focus of attention. They tentatively could be seen as representatives of their group and gave thereby an opportunity to understand the individual as a significant part of the group conflicts. In an attempt to find solutions for these group conflicts, various group processes were initiated and studied. Pathbreaking work hypothesis was that the unsolvable appearing group conflicts were based on conscious and unconscious attitudes, feelings, response readiness and fantasies, which were often establishing identity and therefore difficult to give up. Just the perception of that was accompanied by violent emotions and assumed a high willingness to affect-tolerance in the participants.

According to the purpose of the conference to obtain a deeper understanding of the causes of individual and collective group conflicts and thereby create the conditions for their solution, the method provided a system of various group constellations with either experimental or reflective character. In the one experiences should have been collected in the here and now and evaluated in the other. As far as the experience of a previous conference suggested changes in design, it has been adjusted accordingly. By the third conference, the system of the various groups had initially consolidated. ''Plenary'', ''Review-'' and ''Application-Group'' should help to bring reflexive processes on the way, ''Small-Study-Group'' and in particular the ''System Event'' provided space for feeling, shaping and experience, therefore encounter with oneself and others. A total of 33 ½ hours were distributed over six days – even on the [[Sabbath]]. The ''Application-Group'' was later abandoned.&lt;ref name="r-35" /&gt;

While the challenge in the five ''Plena'' was, to gather again and understand the events and experiences from the other groups and consider single events as part of the whole, ''Review-'' and ''Application-Group'' had other tasks. Both had the same composition of five to seven participants of the same nation and a constant consultant. In the ''Review-Group'' members had to find out what role they had taken in the entire system of the conference and whether or how they changed. The ''Application-Group'' gave the opportunity to consider how the conference experience could be effectively at home in professional or in other roles. In the ''Small-Study-Group'' both nationalities sat with a consultant six times in order to experience the behavior of the group as a group and to look at. The ''System Event'' finally stood with its seven meetings not only in time in the center of the conference. It started in two large groups of separate nationality without consultants; the staff worked throughout public in a third room. That meant he could have been visited and his work could have been observed. In an ongoing process the participants in ''System Event'' had to come to an agreement about the question who wanted to work with whom, in which room, with or without consultant, on which topic and then to do so. In this way, current conflicts appeared, which often were similar to those which were brought along. The ''System Event'' made them because currently (re)enacted, available for experience and allowed to observe and understand them in their origin and meaning. If the process threatened to derail, the staff helped with a targeted interpretation. The goal of all this, so the declared intention of the initiators, is an educational: learning through experience.&lt;ref name="r-36" /&gt;

== Process ==
Each of the three conferences took a unique course, depending on the participants and their histories and stories. In the first&lt;ref name="r-37" /&gt; and second&lt;ref name="r-38" /&gt; conference particularly the fathers and their influence on the development of prejudices and resentments were in the foreground, while in the third conference the mothers came in the focus.&lt;ref name="r-39" /&gt;

Strictly speaking, the conferences for many began even before its beginning with the almost always anxious question: Go there or not?&lt;ref name="r-40" /&gt; In the ongoing process “meaningful moments” by all participants were experienced from “different events”.&lt;ref name="r-41" /&gt; Stories of “perpetrators” and “victims” and the consequences of the Holocaust for future generations – already intellectually worked through by political scientists and historians – were noticeable during the conferences by individual fates and showed the big gap in the individual and personal workup. “Fantasies, Dreams, Unknowns, Unthought-knowns, Unspoken and Unspeakable”&lt;ref name="r-42" /&gt; were alive. This cleared the way for change in the individual. This might be prerequisite to stop on both sides an until today continuing dumb transfer of suffered damages to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="r-43" /&gt;

Although the three conferences were not the same in composition and structure, a process became noticeable, not only during each individual conference, but also during the development of all three conferences. This process intensified during the third conference when the only interpretation that the staff made available to the participants in this conference was as follows:

“Participants have put themselves into a painful situation by coming to this conference, which can be experienced as cruel. This leads to greater dependency on staff for containment, along with fears and disappointment of fantasies about the insufficiency of staff resources. The fearful fantasies may have to do with unexpected, powerful changes in one's sense of identity and the giving up of precious parts of identity, such as the role of the victim (for the Israelis) or the guilt of perpetrators (for the Germans).”&lt;ref name="r-137" /&gt;

One participant had perceived this interpretation as very disturbing but at the same time as leading forward as it had raised questions that required an answer:

“For me, the staff had expressed something unbelievable: the role of victims for the Israelis and the guilt of perpetrators for the Germans should be ‘worthy’ parts of the own identity! This is difficult to accept. The hypothesis suggested the idea that parts of this identity could be given up. But if so then what then? Wouldn't that mean for the Jewish group to dis-identify from the role of victim and for the non-Jewish group to dis-identify from the guilt of perpetrator? Wouldn't that mean to separate in a more deep way from parents who, not only in the world of inner objects but often also in real life have to be the space for our own anxiety or wishes for destruction? Where to put these feelings when the space for it would be lost? What could be the consequences for oneself as well as for the meeting with the others? Isn't one that is touching a toboo in danger of becoming a taboo? Fearful questions might follow from this hypothesis, and many more became possible.”&lt;ref name="r-137" /&gt;

One participant in the Israeli group, a so-called “child survivor” had participated in all three conferences and had widely published about the subject. He was concerned about the question of whether Jews have a face for Germans. During the third conference he had apparently taken on the role of [[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]: he was carrying a plastic bag with him at all times which contained, among other things, one of his publications which he offered for sale. In it he had written:
{{Quote|text=Also, we, the professionals, like the rest, are unable to look into the eyes of those who return from death. |author=Haim Dasberg |source=Echoes of the Holocaust&lt;ref name="dasberg_2000" /&gt;}}
To be able to look into each other's eyes was one of the objectives of these conferences.

== Result ==
The results of the conferences were different from each other and thereby individual nature. One participant put it to words: “To look at this helps in recognizing the difference between ‘the other’ and my fantasies about him/her. This releases me from the imprisonment of fantasies and releases ‘the other’ from the world of my inner objects – I become empty and I don't need to project my inner objects on ‘the other’ any longer – it is a purifying process and I am not stuck. Then, and only then, are both (the other and myself) free to choose relationship with one another, or not.”&lt;ref name="r-44" /&gt;

In addition to these and other individual insights, there was on the other hand also a collective result: two books,&lt;ref name="r-04" /&gt; one in German, one in English, both appeared almost simultaneously and a really common work of all those who wanted to participate. While on the one hand the authors of the two books collected some important chapters for the understanding of the project, its history, design and structure of the conference, on the other hand the conference experience of the participants was presented as a collage: thematically ordered individual contributions of named co-authors. Mira Erlich-Ginor which was authorized by the participants to compile a collage from their contributions, wrote in her introduction: “There are conference-narratives as numerous as the number of participants in them.”&lt;ref name="r-45" /&gt;

The collage was, though all were contacted and asked for participation, mainly borne by participants, who faced the conferences positive. Critical positions hardly can be found. But the two books have helped to make the project accessible for a wider public and the readers of the personal and often painful experiences of the participants were able to learn firsthand.

The reception of the conferences looked quite different in Germany and Israel: “... in contrast to the importance given to this work in Germany and elsewhere, it was not accorded the same place in Israel.” Nevertheless, the assessment “of those Israelis who attended the conferences was decidedly very positive, deeply involved and grateful.”&lt;ref name="r-46" /&gt;

Through lectures, presentations and publications, the work of the conferences received international attention – initially in the psychoanalytic community. 2009 was foreseeable that they “will, and must, have a future.”&lt;ref name="r-47" /&gt; A website was set up and with the ''PCCA'' the conferences opened to all interested parties, so that the project could now turn to other national ''groups in conflict''.

'''Neverland''' is a fictional island featured in the works of [[J. M. Barrie]] and those based on them. It is an imaginary faraway place, where [[Peter Pan]], [[Tinker Bell]], the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] and other mythical creatures and beings live. Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up. The term is often used as a metaphor for eternal [[childhood]] (and childishness), [[immortality]], and [[escapism]]. The concept was first introduced as "the Never Never Land" in the [[theatre play]] ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' by Scottish writer [[J. M. Barrie]], first staged in 1904.

In his 1911 novelisation ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'', Barrie referred to "the Neverland", and its many variations "the Neverlands", although the caption to one of Bedford's illustrations calls it "The Never Never Land".&lt;ref Name="PeterandWendy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Barrie | first = James Matthew | authorlink = J. M. Barrie | title = Peter and Wendy | publisher = Hodder &amp; Stoughton | year = 1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest drafts of Barrie's play, the island was called "Peter's Never Never Never Land", a name possibly influenced by "[[Never Never (Australian outback)|the Never Never]]", a contemporary term for [[outback]] Australia. In the 1928 published version of the script, the name was shortened to "the Never Land". Neverland has been featured prominently in subsequent works that either adapted Barrie's works or expanded upon them. These Neverlands sometimes vary in nature from the original.

==Nature of Neverland==
Barrie explains that the Neverlands are found in the minds of children, and that although each is "always more or less an island", and they have a family resemblance, they are not the same from one child to the next. For example, [[John Darling (Peter Pan)|John Darling]]'s had "a lagoon with flamingos flying over it", while his little brother [[Michael Darling (Peter Pan)|Michael]]'s had "a flamingo with lagoons flying over it". The novel says the Neverlands are compact enough that adventures are never far between. It says that a map of a child's mind would resemble a map of Neverland, with no boundaries at all.&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, James Matthew (1911). ''Peter and Wendy.'' Hodder &amp; Stoughton&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact situation of Neverland is ambiguous and vague. In Barrie's original tale, the name for the real world is the Mainland, which suggests Neverland is a small island, reached by flight. Peter tells Wendy the way to Neverland is "second  to the right, and straight on till morning", but he is described as saying "anything that came into his head". In the novel, the children are said to have found the island only because it was "out looking for them". Barrie also writes that Neverland is near the "stars of the milky way" and it is reached "always at the time of sunrise".

Walt Disney's 1953 ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' suggests Neverland is located in space, adding a "star" to Peter's directions: "second star to the right, and straight on till morning". From afar, these stars depict Neverland in the distance. The 2003 film version repeats this representation, as the Darling children are flown through the solar system to reach Neverland.

In Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' (1906), a proto-version of Neverland called the "birds' island" is located in the [[The Serpentine|Serpentine]] in [[Kensington Gardens]]. The baby Peter reaches it by flight or by sailing in a paper boat or a thrush's nest.

The passage of time in Neverland is similarly ambiguous. The novel ''Peter and Wendy'' mentions that in Neverland there are many more suns and moons than on the Mainland, making time difficult to track.&lt;ref&gt; Barrie, J.M. (1911) ''Peter &amp; Wendy'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; One way to tell the time is to find the crocodile, and wait until the clock inside it strikes the hour.&lt;ref&gt; Barrie, J.M. (1911) ''Peter &amp; Wendy'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; Although Neverland is widely thought of as a place where children don't grow up, Barrie wrote that the Lost Boys eventually grew up and have to leave, and fairies there lived typically short lifespans. 

In ''[[Peter Pan in Scarlet]]'', the children get to Neverland by flying on a road called the High Way. The island is located in a sea known as the Sea of One Thousand Islands. Time freezes as soon as the children arrived in Neverland.

In the miniseries ''[[Neverland (miniseries)|Neverland]]'', inspired by Barrie's works, Neverland is said to be another planet existing at the centre of the universe. It is accessible only via a magic portal generated by a strange sphere, where time has frozen due to external cosmic forces converging on the planet, preventing anyone living there from ageing.

===Canon===
In J.M. Barrie's play and novel, most of the adventures in the stories take place in the Neverwood, where the Lost Boys hunt and fight the pirates and redskins.

Peter and the Lost Boys live in the Home Under The Ground, which is accessed by sliding down hollowed tree trunks, one for each boy. "It consisted of one large room, ... with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor."&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J.M. (1911) ''Peter &amp; Wendy'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Home Under the Ground also contains Tinker Bell's "private apartment".

The Little House is built from branches by the Lost Boys for Wendy after she is hit by Tootles' arrow. At the end of the play, one year after the main events in the story, the house appears in different spots every night, but always on some tree-tops. The Little House is the original "[[Wendy house]]", now the name of a children's playhouse.

The "Jolly Roger" is the pirates' [[brig]], described by Barrie as "a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull".&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J.M. (1911) ''Peter &amp; Wendy'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The mermaids live in the Mermaids' Lagoon, which is also the location of Marooners' Rock, the most dangerous place in Neverland. Trapped on Marooners' Rock in the lagoon just offshore, Peter faced impending death by drowning, as he could not swim or fly from it to safety. The mermaids made no attempt to rescue him, but he was saved by the Never bird.

===Non-canon===
In the many film, television and video game adaptations of Peter Pan, adventures which originally take place in either the Mermaids' Lagoon, the Neverwood forest or on the pirates' ship are played out in a greater number of more elaborate locations.

In the Disney franchise version of Neverland, many non-canon locales are added, which make appearances variously throughout film, TV and video game instalments. These include

* '''Cannibal Cove/Tiki Forest''' - A jungle environment filled with [[monkey]]s, [[parrot]]s, [[Wild boar|boars]], [[cobra]]s, bees and a "host of evil traps." It is occupied by a tribe reminiscent of both African and indigenous Pacific-Islander cultures. This location appears regularly in the Disney Channel's animated series ''[[Jake and the Neverland Pirates]]''.

It also adds or gives names to implied locations within Barrie's original Neverland, such as:

* '''Never Land Plains''' - A location where the Indians reside
* '''Skull Rock''' - A location where the "pirates are said to hide their booty."
* '''Crocodile Creek''' - A swamp environment where the Crocodile lives.

The '''Black Castle''' referred to in the 2003 film is an old ruined and abandoned castle, decorated with stone [[dragon]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. It is one of the places where Tiger Lily is taken by Captain James Hook. This sequence is based on the Marooner's Rock sequence in the original play and book and, like Disney's non-canon "Skull Rock", Black Castle replaces Marooners's Rock in this film.

'''Neverpeak Mountain''' is the huge mountain that is right in the middle of Neverland. According to ''Peter Pan in Scarlet'', when a child is on top of Neverpeak Mountain, he or she can see over anyone and anything and can see beyond belief.

'''The Maze of Regrets''' is a maze in ''Peter Pan in Scarlet'' where all the mothers of the Lost Boys go to find their boys.

'''Pixie Hollow''' is where Tinker Bell and her tiny fairy friends live and dwell in Disney's ''Tinker Bell'' movies and related books.

The '''Neverseas'''  are the seas around Neverland in Disney's ''Tinker Bell'' films. Some small islands can be found in it, and it seems that it can communicate with the real seas, as a normal ship comes across the path of a young James Hook in ''The Pirate Fairy''.

In Steven Spielberg's 1991 film ''Hook'', the pirates occupy a small port town peppered with merchant shopfronts, warehouses, hotels, pubs and an improvised baseball field, and many ships and boats of varying sizes and kinds fill the harbour, as the pirates, since Peter's disappearance, have been able to expand their territory. The Home Underground has also been replaced by an intricate tree house structure which is prominent on the landscape rather than concealed, as the Lost Boys have successfully taken over their part of Neverland. This structure is possibly a continued development of Peter's "house atop the trees" which he occupies following Hook's defeat and the Lost Boys' return to the Mainland, presumably because he no longer has to hide nor house a large community. The number of lost boys have also increased and they navigate their home via hybrid wind-surfer/skateboard tracks, as the power of flight was lost with Peter. The Mermaids' Lagoon is directly connected to the Lost Boys' tree house structure by a giant clam-shell pulley system, possibly because they have become allies to the Lost Boys in Peter's absence. The Home Underground is discovered buried and forgotten by an adult Peter in the film, underneath the new home of the Lost Boys. Thus, while more elaborate, the locations of the Home Underground and the Pirates are unchanged. Neither the redskins nor their territory appear in the film.

==Inhabitants==

===Fairies===
'''[[Fairy|Fairies]]''' are arguably the most important magical inhabitants of the Neverland, and its primary [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] users. A property of their nature is the production and possession of fairy dust, the magic material which enables flying for all characters except Peter, who was taught to fly by the birds (as described by Barrie in ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]''), and later by the fairies in Kensington Gardens. They are allied to the Lost Boys and against the pirates. The only-named fairy is [[Tinker Bell]], [[Peter Pan]]'s companion, whose name alludes to her profession as a "tinker" or fixer of pots and pans. Tinker Bell is essentially a household fairy, but far from benign. Her exotic, fiery nature, and capacity for evil and mischief, due to fairies being too small to feel more than one type of emotion at any one time, is reminiscent of the more hostile fairies encountered by Peter in Kensington Gardens.

In Barrie's play and novel, the roles of fairies are brief: they are allies to the Lost Boys, the source of fairy dust and where they act as "guides" for parties travelling to and from Neverland. They are also responsible for the collection of abandoned or lost babies from the Mainland to the Neverland. The roles and activities of the fairies are more elaborate in ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]''. They occupy kingdoms in the Gardens and at night, "mischief children who are locked in after dark" to their deaths or entertain them before they return to their parents the following day, and they guard the paths to a "Proto-Neverland" called the birds' island. These fairies are more regal and engage in a variety of human activities in a magical fashion. They have courts, can grant wishes to children and have a practical relationship with the birds, which is however "strained by differences". They are portrayed as dangerous, whimsical and extremely clever but quite hedonistic. After forgetting how to fly, unable to be taught by the birds, (see birds, below), Peter is given the power to fly again by the fairies.

Barrie writes that "when the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, ... and that was the beginning of fairies".&lt;ref&gt;'''Peter Pan'' Play and novel, JM Barrie'&lt;/ref&gt; and Neverland's fairies can be killed whenever someone says they don't believe in fairies, suggesting that the race of fairies is finite and exhaustible. When dying from Hook's poison, Tinker Bell is saved when Peter and other children and adults across the Neverlands and Mainland call out "I do believe in fairies, I do, I do", so their deaths are not necessarily permanent. At the end of Barrie's novel Wendy asks Peter about Tinker Bell, whom he has forgotten and he answers, "I expect she is no more".

The [[Disney Fairies]] Peter Pan franchise has elaborated on aspects of Barrie's fairy mythology. The "Never Fairies" (and associated sparrow men) live in Pixie Hollow, located in the heart of Neverland.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Peterson, ''In the Realm of the Never Fairies: The Secret World of Pixie Hollow'', Disney Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the [[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell film]], after the baby's first laugh enters a flower, it breaks the flower into numerous pieces (the seeds), any piece that can blow with the wind and survive the trip to Pixie Hollow becomes a fairy, who then learns his/her specific talent.

===Birds===
In the novel and the play, between the flight from the mainland (reality) and the Neverland, they are relatively simple animals which provide entertainment, instruction and some limited guidance to flyers. These birds are described as unable to sight its shores, "even, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners".

The Never Bird saves Peter from drowning when he is stranded on Marooners' Rock, by giving him her nest which he uses as a sailing vessel.

In Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', birds have a far more prominent role on a proto-Neverland called the Birds' Island. On the island, the various birds speak bird-language, described as being related to fairy language which can be understood by young humans, who used to be birds. The birds are responsible for bringing human babies into the Mainland, whose human parents send folded paper boats along the serpentine "with 'boy' or 'girl' and 'thin' or 'fat' (and so on) written", indicating to the official birds which species to send back to transform into human children, who are described as having an "itch on their backs where their wings used to be" and that their warbles are fairy/bird talk.

===Lost Boys===
The '''[[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]]''' are a tribe of "children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not looking",&lt;ref&gt;Peter and Wendy, JM Barrie (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; and who, having not been claimed by humans in seven days, were collected by the fairies and flown to the Neverland. There are no "lost girls" because, as Peter explains, girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams and be lost in this manner. There are six Lost Boys: Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly and the Twins. They are not permitted to fly by Peter, as it is a sign of his authority and uniqueness. They live in [[tree house]]s and [[cave]]s, wear animal skins, have spears and bows and arrows, and live for adventure. They are a formidable fighting force despite their youth and they make war with the pirates, although they seem to enjoy a harmonious existence with the other inhabitants of Neverland.

===Pirates===
The crew of the '''[[Piracy|Pirate]]''' ship ''Jolly Roger'' have taken up residence off-shore, and are widely feared throughout Neverland. How they came to be in Neverland is unclear. Their captain is the ruthless [[Captain Hook|James Hook]], named after the hook in place of his right hand.

==="Redskins"===
There is a tribe of [[wigwam]]-dwelling '''[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s''' who live on the island, referred to by Barrie as "[[Native American naming controversy|Redskins]]" or the [[Pickaninny|Piccaninny]] tribe. Their [[Tribal chief|chief]] is Great Big Little Panther, whose daughter Tiger Lily has a crush on Peter Pan. The Piccaninny tribe are known to make ferocious and deadly war against Captain Hook and his pirates, but their connection with the Lost Boys is more lighthearted. For "many moons" the two groups have captured each other, only to promptly release the captives, as though it were a game.

===Mermaids===
'''[[Mermaid]]s''' live in the [[lagoon]]. They enjoy the company of [[Peter Pan]] but keep their distance from everyone else on the island, including the fairies. They are not sociable creatures and do not speak nor interact with outsiders. They are malevolent, hedonistic and frivolous; yet they sing and play "mermaid games" in which they "rise to the surface in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles",  "made in [[rainbow]] water". They also "love to bask out on Marooners' Rock, combing their hair in a lazy way". At first glance, Wendy is enchanted by their beauty, but finds them vain and irritating, as they would "splash her with their tails, not accidentally, but intentionally" when she attempted to steal a closer look.  Their homes are "coral caves underneath the waves" to which they retire at sunset and rising tide, as well as in anticipation of storms. When one mermaid tries to pull Wendy into the water and drown her, Peter intervenes and hisses{{spaced ndash}}rather than crows{{spaced ndash}}at them and they quickly dive into the water and disappear.  Barrie describes the mermaids' "haunting" transformation at the "turn of the moon" while "uttering strange wailing cries" at night as the lagoon becomes a very "dangerous place for mortals". The Mermaids' Lagoon is a favourite "adventure" for the children, and where they take their "midday meal". Peter gives Wendy one of the mermaid's combs as a gift.

The 2003 film ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]]'' briefly describes mermaids as different from those in traditional story books, but as "dark creatures in touch with all things mysterious", and who will drown humans who get too close, but do not harm Peter who seems to be the only one who can speak the mermaid's language. They always seem to know Hook's whereabouts on the island at any given time and tell Peter.

===Animal kingdom===
'''Animals''' (referred to as "beasts") live throughout Neverland, such as [[Bear]]s, [[Tiger]]s, [[Lion]]s, [[Gray wolf|Wolves]], [[Flamingo]]es and [[Crocodile]]s. In Barrie's original novel, these "beasts" hunt the Piccaninny tribe, who hunt the Pirates, who are themselves hunting the Lost Boys, who in turn hunt the beasts, creating a chain of prey and murder in the Neverland that only ends when one party stops or slows down, or when Peter redirects the Lost Boys to other tasks and activities. Like all the agencies of the Neverland, the animals do not need to eat, nor are they eaten when killed, nor do they reproduce (as they enjoy the same immortality as all other inhabitants), so their presence is a paradox. There are also a variety of birds, whose societies are present in the proto-Neverland described in Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]''.

===Other residents===
Other inhabitants of Neverland are suggested by Barrie in his original novel, such as a "small old lady with a hooked nose", "[[gnome]]s who are mostly tailors", and [[prince]]s "with six elder brothers"{{spaced ndash}}reminiscent of European [[fairy tales]]. There are also some briefly described locations without inhabitants, but the narrator hints at their former presence, such as a "hut fast going to decay".

==Popular culture==

'''Noah Walter Parden''' (c. 1868{{spaced ndash}}February 23, 1944) was an American attorney and politician who was active in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], and [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] between 1891 and 1940.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Noah Waldo [sic] Parden, Negro Lawyer, Dies|last = |first = |date = March 3, 1944|work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906 he became one of the first African-American attorneys to serve as lead counsel in a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], and he was among the first to make an [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|oral argument]] before the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching that Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism|last = Curriden|first = Mark, and Leroy Phillips, Jr.|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0571199525|location = New York|pages = 348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he became the first African American to be appointed to the position of Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, a public office, in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = N.W.

== Education and personal life ==
Noah Parden was born near [[Rome, Georgia]], probably in 1868.  His mother was a former slave who worked as a housekeeper and cook.  His father was a white man.  When he was about seven years old he was sent to an orphanage after the death of his mother, who had raised him as a single parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/roman-changed-face-of-u-s-justice/article_70c2d025-f9f7-575b-83a4-5e973bcdef7.html|title = Roman Changed Face of U.S. Justice|last = Ragland|first = Mike|date = August 21, 2010|work = Rome News-Tribune|access-date = February 21, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 he left Rome for Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he supported himself by working as a barber and at other odd jobs while he spent five years attending [[Howard High School (Tennessee)|Howard High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Black America Series: Chattanooga|last = Chattanooga African American Museum|first = |publisher = Arcadia Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0738518435|location = Charleston, SC|pages = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1889|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1889|isbn = |location = Chattanooga, TN|pages = 261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1890|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1890|isbn = |location = Chattanooga, TN|pages = 293, 521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated in May 1890, presenting the class oration on "The Duty of a Citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tennessee School Report 1890: Annual Report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Scholastic Year ending June 30, 1890.

In 1892 he married Mattie S. Broyles (March 29, 1870 – July 15, 1934), a native of [[Dalton, Georgia]] whom he had met in Nashville, and they settled in Chattanooga where they remained until 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two children, Frank B. Parden, who died August 22, 1925, and Lillian Parden Bracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Body Washes Ashore|last = |first = |date = August 25, 1920|work = Asbury Park (NJ) Press|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Chattanooga, Parden and his family moved briefly to [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and then settled in East St. Louis, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Illinois Honors Unsung Lawyer from the '20s|last = Parish|first = Norm|date = March 7, 2003|work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date = |via = Infotrak Newsstand}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 the Pardens moved to neighboring St. Louis, Missouri, although Noah Parden continued to maintain a law office in East St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Israel|first=Benjamin|date=2008|title=How an African American Killed a White Cop and was Acquitted: A Startling Tale of Law Enforcement in Black St. Louis|url=https://cenhum.artsci.wustl.edu/file/jan-may-2008|journal=Belles Lettres: A Literary Review|issue=vol. 8, no. 2|page=34|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mattie Parden's death in 1934, Noah Parden married Elizabeth Polk, a divorcee from East St. Louis.  Her former husband Tranne Polk, an East St. Louis detective and politician, had been acquitted on charges of assaulting Parden in 1933.  During the trial, Polk testified that Parden had interfered in his personal affairs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Honors Sought for Pioneering Black Lawyer; Noah Parden Broke Barriers, Overcame Obstacles; Wharton Wants Legislative Action|last = Parish|first = Norm|date = January 2, 2003|work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date = |via = Infotrak Newsstand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parden was able to speak several languages, played the violin, and was knowledgeable about art, music and literature.  He also remained connected to his rural roots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/effort-under-way-to-honor-pioneering-black-lawyer/article_08ccaaad-a6c2-544b-bca9-20e0f5a2ebe3.html|title=Effort under way to honor pioneering black lawyer|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2003|work=Northwest Indiana Times|access-date=May 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 1920s he had acquired a 400-acre cotton plantation near [[Hickory, Mississippi]], where he vacationed and to which he would briefly retire before returning to live in St. Louis until the end of his life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Jury Deadlocked in Murder Trial|last=|first=|date=December 11, 1929|work=Edwardsville (IL) Intelligencer|access-date=|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the farm, he did agricultural work to relax; he also knew how to sew, knit and make his own clothing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Parden died on February 23, 1944, and was buried at Booker Washington Cemetery in Centreville Station, Illinois.  He was survived by his wife Elizabeth, his daughter, and a stepdaughter, Gertrude Polk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legal and political career ==
Noah Parden practiced law from 1891 to 1940, a career which spanned 49 years.  At the end of 1929 he claimed to have defended 236 people accused of murder, of whom one had been legally executed and another lynched.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In addition to his private legal practice he also worked as a prosecutor, serving for nine years (1908-1917) as an assistant state's attorney in [[St. Clair County, Illinois]], and for five years (1935-1940) as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He intermittently engaged in writing, editing and public speaking, and was involved in local politics in East St. Louis and St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court|last=Curriden and Phillips|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=(no title)|last=|first=|date=October 29, 1928|work=Centralia (IL) Evening Sentinel|access-date=|via=newspaperarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities in Chattanooga, 1891-1906 ===
After receiving his law degree in 1891 Noah Parden began his career as an attorney in Chattanooga.  in 1892, he briefly established a partnership with another black attorney, James P. Easley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1892|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1892|isbn = |location = Chattanooga, TN|pages = 557}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1895 Parden and Easley also published a newspaper, the ''Chattanooga'' ''Herald'', although Parden soon sold his share in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = The Fourth Estate|last = |first = |date = August 22, 1895|work = |access-date = |via = |page = 11|edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = City Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1895|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1895|isbn = |location = |pages = 477}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He gained a reputation as an effective defense attorney who was able to obtain victories for his African-American clients in jury trials despite the [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] employed in local courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The [[Lynching of Ed Johnson|Ed Johnson case]] and [[United States v. Shipp|United States v. Shipp (203 U.S. 563 [1906])]] ====
In 1906 Parden was asked to represent Ed Johnson, a black Chattanooga man who had been convicted of the rape of Nevada Taylor, a white woman, and sentenced to death.  Together with [[Styles L. Hutchins, Jr]]., an African-American attorney and former Tennessee state legislator, and [[Lewis Shepherd]], a white attorney and former judge, Parden began working to overturn Johnson's conviction.  No concrete evidence linked Johnson to the crime, and, as Parden argued, the trial had been replete with errors including open demonstrations of bias against Johnson by a member of the jury, exclusion of blacks from the jury pool, and a so-called mob mentality in the courtroom during the trial.  Nevertheless, the Chattanooga court refused to reopen the case and the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] refused to authorize a stay of execution that would have allowed for a new trial, on the grounds that there had been no specific error in the trial to warrant it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 141–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parden then filed a petition for a [[Habeas corpus|writ of habeas corpus]] with the U.S. Federal Court in Knoxville, citing the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1867|Habeas Corpus Act]] of 1867, which allowed defendants in state court cases to seek relief from federal courts if they believed their Constitutional rights had been violated.  He argued that the state courts had violated Johnson's rights by excluding blacks from juries, a form of discrimination which the United States Supreme Court had determined to be illegal.  Although the court rejected this argument, Judge C.D. Clark did stay Johnson's execution to allow Parden and his colleagues to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, which had the power to rule in favor of federal intervention in a state court case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 150–155, 167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 1906, Parden presented his petition before [[John Marshall Harlan II|Justice John Marshall Harlan]], arguing that the Johnson trial had included flagrant violations of the defendant's Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day the Court accepted the case, staying Johnson's sentence and ordering both sides to prepare for oral arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the night of March 18, however, a mob in Chattanooga broke into the jail, kidnapped Johnson, and [[Lynching|lynched]] him, hanging him from the [[Walnut Street Bridge (Tennessee)|Walnut Street bridge]] over the Tennessee River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2015/jan/18/cook-what-justice-ed-johnson/283290/|title = Why some Chattanoogans won't walk across Walnut Street Bridge|last = Cook|first = David|date = January 18, 2015|work = Chattanooga Times-Free Press|access-date = February 21, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government responded to the lynching as a violation of federal law, as Johnson had been under the protection of a Supreme Court order when it occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Federal Power After Slayers of Ed. Johnson|last = Ohl|first = Jos.|date = March 23, 1906|work = The Atlanta Constitution|via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, seven of his deputies, and a group of men thought to have belonged to the lynch mob were charged with [[Contempt of court|criminal contempt]] of the United States Supreme Court, the mob members for their role in Johnson's murder and the law enforcement officers for willfully neglecting to protect him despite the likelihood of mob violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Attachments in Shipp Case|last = |first = |date = May 25, 1909|work = Nashville American|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909 Shipp and five others were found guilty of contempt after the only criminal trial ever conducted by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Sheriff Shipp in Contempt|last = |first = |date = May 25, 1909|work = New York Sun|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noah Parden and Styles Hutchins worked with the Justice Department in gathering information and identifying witnesses for the case; however, both attorneys ended their involvement before the case went to trial, and neither returned to Chattanooga, where supporters of Shipp and the lynch mob had threatened and intimidated those they considered their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 259, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities in East St. Louis and St. Louis, 1907-1940 ===
Noah Parden spent the remainder of his professional life in the [[twin cities]] of East St. Louis, Illinois, where he settled in late 1906 or early 1907,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and St. Louis, Missouri, where he relocated with his family in 1922.  His practice included white as well as black clients,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom: The East St. Louis Race Riot and Black Politics|last=Lumpkins|first=Charles L.|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0821418031|location=Athens, OH|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he held elective office by serving on the St. Clair County Board of Supervisors, to which he was elected in 1907 and where he chaired the judiciary committee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this phase of his career also reflected the segregated character of the two cities' legal and political institutions.

==== Work as a prosecutor ====
Parden served as a prosecutor in both cities.  He was appointed to multiple two-year terms as an Assistant State's Attorney in East St. Louis, serving from 1908 to 1917, and became the first black attorney to be appointed an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in St. Louis, a position he held from 1935 until his retirement in 1940.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In both jurisdictions he was assigned the task of trying African Americans brought before the court.  In East St. Louis his work included prosecution of black suspects accused of carrying concealed weapons, an arrangement which, according to historian Charles Lumpkins, provided black people with "access to legal redress" that would not otherwise have been available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In St. Louis, his job was to prosecute black men accused of abandoning their families.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Career of Negro Lawyer Chosen Prosecutor's Assistant|last=|first=|date=January 8, 1935|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date=|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Involvement with East St. Louis reform and machine politics ====
Parden quickly became politically active in East St. Louis.  In 1910 he ran for the position of Assistant State's Attorney on the ticket of the Progressive Citizens' Party, a reform group which had coalesced in opposition to the Administration (Democratic regular) party allied with the [[political machine]] led by [[Political boss|boss]] [[Locke Tarleton]].  His Administration opponent, dentist and activist Dr. [[Leroy bundy|Leroy Bundy]], was also an African American, and black East St. Louisians anticipated that this support by white political leaders for black candidates would lead to greater black access to local government.  However, the Progressive Citizens Party ran on an anti-corruption platform and did not extend patronage or access to African Americans, while the machine was perceived as stingy with its money and patronage.  Both Parden and Bundy became part of a group of black professional men who responded by forming an all-black Republican organization, the St. Clair County Republican League, in 1916.  This independent group sought to navigate between East St. Louis's white political factions and gain more benefits for black residents; sociologist Elliot Rudwick has argued that "Bundy and his followers were demanding political equality" via access to the same pool of money and city jobs that was available to white voters.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/paper/7005/2302%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%BD|title=Black East St. Louis: Politics and Economy in a Border City, 1860-1945|last=Lumpkins|first=Charles L.|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2006|isbn=|location=Ph.D. dissertation|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot at East St. Louis, July 2, 1917|last=Rudwick|first=Elliot M.|publisher=Meridian Books|year=1966|isbn=978-0252009518|location=Cleveland, OH|pages=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so they became involved in political corruption themselves.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Malcolm|date=2008|title=Ghetto Formation and Armed Resistance in East St. Louis, Illinois|url=|journal=Journal of American Studies|issue=vol. 41, no. 2|page=448|doi=10.1017/Soo2187580703544|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 Parden worked for the Republican Party with the expectation of reappointment as Assistant State's Attorney after the election.  In the lead-up to the 1917 mayoral election, incumbent Fred Mollman and his allies exerted pressure on black voters.  Mollman promised to hire more black policemen and build a firehouse in a black neighborhood as incentives for their support, while Parden's boss, State's Attorney Hubert Schaumleffel, threatened them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot|last=Rudwick|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parden was enlisted to convey to African-American saloon owners and participants in the gambling and prostitution businesses that if Mollman won the election, a crackdown on their establishments which had taken effect early in 1917 would be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Never Been a Time: The 1917 Race Riot that Sparked the Civil Rights Movement|last=Barnes|first=Harper|publisher=Walker Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0802715753|location=New York|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Mollman's victory Parden, along with hundreds of other politically-involved African Americans, participated in a post-election banquet attended by the mayor and his allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black East St. Louis|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The [[1917 race riot|1917 Race Riot]] and its aftermath ====
On July 2, 1917, East St. Louis was engulfed by a bloody race riot, characterized by violent attacks by white mobs on blacks to whom little protection was provided by law enforcement.  Hundreds of black residents were killed and thousands left homeless by the riots.  Although Noah Parden encouraged his client and one-time political rival Leroy Bundy to leave the city during the tense days before the riot, he himself remained at his home in East St. Louis, later testifying that on the night of July 1 he had responded to the arrival of a carload of white men cruising past his house in a [[Ford Model T|Model T Ford]] and shooting from the car, by running to his own front door with a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ghetto Formation and Armed Resistance|last=McLaughlin|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parden family survived the riot unharmed, but its aftermath was professionally damaging to Parden.  He had lost his post as Assistant State's Attorney after an initial outbreak of white-on-black violence in May 1917, when the Board of Supervisors abolished the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black East St. Louis|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the July riots he was arrested along with other black leaders, based on the assumption that they must have been promoting discontent among the black populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot|last=Rudwick|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parden was among those charged with organizing a black militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black East St. Louis|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not convicted (and there was no evidence that a black militia had in fact been organized), and he was able to testify on Bundy's behalf when Bundy was tried for participating in a conspiracy to provoke the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot|last=Rudwick|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other black East St. Louisians were convicted on riot-related charges and sent to prison.  In 1924 Parden and other black Republicans supported the re-election campaign of Illinois governor [[Len Small]], who not only appointed African Americans to public positions but had granted clemency to some of those convicted for their alleged roles in the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal practice in St. Louis ====
After relocating to St. Louis, Parden practiced law in both Illinois and Missouri.  His successes as a defense attorney included the 1923 St. Louis case of Joseph Kyle, a black man who was found not guilty of murdering a white police officer by reason of self-defense, the officer and his partner having shot first at Kyle in the dark and without identifying themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How an African American Killed a White Cop|last=Israel|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also remained involved in local politics, becoming active as a Democrat in St. Louis's Twenty-third Ward.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  He spent the final five years of his career working as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney and was recognized as the first black attorney to be appointed to the position.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Appearance before the United States Supreme Court ==
Noah Parden was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] of the United States Supreme Court in 1906 on the recommendation of [[Emanuel D. Molyneaux Hewlett]], an African American attorney and member of the Supreme Court bar who acted as a co-counsel in many cases involving black southerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defying Disenfranchisement: Black Voting Rights Activism in the Jim Crow South, 1890-1908|last=Riser|first=R.

=== Argument before the Supreme Court ===
Parden's argument before Justice Harlan marked the first time that the Supreme Court involved itself in a lynching case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trial and Triumph: Essays in Tennessee's African American History|last=Webb|first=Michael|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572332041|editor-last=West|editor-first=Carroll Van|location=Knoxville, TN|pages=282|chapter=God Bless You All--I Am Innocent: Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, Chattanooga, and the Lynching of Ed Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his presentation, Parden argued that Johnson's trial had violated his Constitutional rights under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]].  Legal analyst Mark Curriden and attorney Leroy Phillips note that all of the issues of Constitutional interpretation raised by Parden were later accepted by the Supreme Court.  In terms of the Johnson case, Parden's most important argument was that the right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment applied to state as well as federal courts.  Prior to Parden's appearance before Harlan, the Court had been reluctant to claim federal jurisdiction over state courts, but the evidence of flagrant denial of Johnson's rights that Parden presented led them to do so, in what Curriden and Phillips describe as a "precedent-setting" intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court|last=Curriden and Phillips|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=13–15, 193–94, 343–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status as an African-American pioneer ===
Parden was among a small number of African-American attorneys to present cases before the Supreme Court during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  In their 1999 study ''Contempt of Court'', Curriden and Phillips asserted that he was the first black attorney to reach two milestones: presentation of an oral argument before a member of the Court (rather than being part of a team of attorneys in which another, white lawyer made the oral arguments), and recognition as lead attorney on a case accepted by the full Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court|last=Curriden and Phillips|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other black attorneys preceded Parden in one or both of these categories.  In 1890 [[Everett J. Waring]], a black lawyer and educator from Columbus, Ohio, argued the case of [[Navassa Island|Jones v. United States (137 U.S. 202 [1890])]] before the Court; law professor J.

== Recognition and honors ==
Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, Parden's career and accomplishments have begun to receive public recognition.  In 2003, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] adopted a resolution honoring Parden "for his dedication and commitment to the causes of justice and equality," and recognizing "his contributions to the citizens of Illinois and the country."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Nobel Prize effect''' is an observation about the adverse effects of winning the [[Nobel Prize]] on laureates and their careers. These effects include reduced productivity, constraints in areas of work, and public perception of expertise in areas unrelated to the laureate's work. The term '''Nobel effect''' is also used in those contexts, as well as in the context of the winner's longevity, and influence on international law in the case of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==Productivity==
The definition of the "Nobel Prize effect" most attributed to [[Richard Hamming]] describes the effect as a reduction in productivity, making it hard for a scientist to work on small problems after winning the prize. During a speech at a seminar, Hamming described a scene at the Nobel awards ceremony as follows:{{quote|... all three winners got up and made speeches. The third one, [[Walter Houser Brattain|Brattain]], practically with tears in his eyes, said, "I know about this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter Brattain." Well I said to myself, "That is nice." But in a few weeks I saw it was affecting him. Now he could only work on great problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Hamming |title=You and Your Research |publisher=Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar |url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html |date=7 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public perception==
The Nobel Prize effect is also described as a consequence of public perception of the [[Nobel laureate]], magnified by the worldwide exposure the winner experiences. One example is for the Nobel laureate to be treated with reverence due to perception that the laureate has authoritative knowledge about any subject outside the field in which he or she won the prize. Nobel Laureate [[Klaus von Klitzing]] describes the effect as a personal burden, because other people have a tendency to believe that a Nobel Prize winner's knowledge extends to all areas. At the same time, he acknowledges that this is also a benefit, because people in positions of authority will pay attention to the views of Nobel laureates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mike Donachie |title=Metro's guide to quantum physics: Nobel Prize winner explains all during London visit |newspaper=Metro London |date=22 September 2013 |url=http://metronews.ca/news/london/802741/metros-guide-to-quantum-physics-nobel-prize-winner-explains-all-during-london-visit/ |quote=The Nobel Prize effect: Dr. Klaus von Klitzing is treated like a rock star as he meets staff and students at Western University.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As physicist [[Hubert Curien]] described the phenomenon in a [[Natural Environment Research Council]] lecture:
{{quote|If someone wins the Nobel prize, he is immediately pounced upon by all kinds of people who ask him all kinds of questions on all kinds of subjects which he knows nothing about. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to reply&amp;nbsp;– to give any old answer on subjects which he knows nothing about. We have seen colleagues who have won a Nobel prize talking nonsense on such and such a political question, on which they really have no knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Curien, Hubert |title=The contribution of space research to knowledge and control of the environment: 1991 NERC annual lecture |journal=NERC News |volume=20 |pages=16–17 |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6z9MAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22If+someone+wins+the+nobel+prize%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another example of the effect of new public perception is when the works of the Nobel Laureate suddenly become popular and in demand due to the fame that the Nobel Prize confers on the winner. Canadian author [[Alice Munro]], winner of the 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], suddenly found herself with a Chinese audience with such strong demands for her works that they quickly sold out, and two publishers in China became embroiled in a dispute over publication rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bai Shi |title=The Nobel Prize Effect |url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/culture/txt/2013-11/11/content_577153.htm |newspaper=Beijing Review |date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perception among colleagues in the same discipline was thought to have a measurable effect on how often the Nobel laureate's works are cited before and after winning the prize. While a simple comparison of citation counts before and after the prize does suggest an impact, a study using matched synthetic control group in the analysis suggest that there is no such effect on either citation impact or related chain reactions of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudolf Farys, Tobias Wolbring |date=26 May 2017 |title=Matched control groups for modeling events in citation data: An illustration of nobel prize effects in citation networks |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |volume=68 |issue=9 |pages=2201–2210 |doi=10.1002/asi.23802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nobel Peace Prize==
In addition to the life-changing effects of winning a Nobel prize, an alternative meaning exists for the Nobel effect in the context of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In this context, legal scholars have argued whether Nobel Peace Prize laureates have, as a result of winning the Prize, influenced the shaping of new norms in international law and international relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roger P Alford |title=The Nobel Effect: Nobel Peace Prize Laureates as International Norm Entrepreneurs |year=2008 |journal=Notre Dame Law School Scholarly Works |number=406 |url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Gregory Gordon, Anne Kjelling |title=Response to Roger Alford's The Nobel Effect: Nobel Peace Prize Laureates as International Norm Entrepreneurs |date=15 October 2008 |publisher=Opinio Juris |url=http://opiniojuris.org/2008/10/15/response-to-roger-alfords-the-nobel-effect-nobel-peace-prize-laureates-as-international-norm-entrepreneurs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggesting that the Peace Prize can be a significant factor in encouraging peacemaking among individuals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author= Lukasz Swiatek |title=Lights, Camera, Accolade: Towards and Understanding of the Nature and Impacts of the Nobel Peace Prize |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2123/7201 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity==
An analysis of birth data on 19th century science Nobel Prize winners estimated that winning the Nobel Prize correlated with one or two years of additional longevity for the recipient, compared to being merely nominated for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mortality and immortality: The Nobel Prize as an experiment into the effect of status upon longevity |authors=Matthew D.Rablen, Andrew J.

[[File:Benjamin west Death wolfe noble savage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A detail from [[Benjamin West]]'s heroic, [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[history painting]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771), depicting an idealized [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryd|first=Vivien Green|title=Rereading the Indian in Benjamin West's "Death of General Wolfe"|year=1995|work=American Art|volume=9|number=1|page=75|jstor=3109196}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''noble savage''' is a literary [[stock character]] who embodies the concept of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigene]], outsider, wild human, an "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" who has not been "corrupted" by [[civilization]], and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness.

In English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in [[John Dryden]]'s heroic play ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1672),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27Av0zEmlqkC&amp;pg=PA106 |first=Earl |last=Miner |contribution=The Wild Man Through the Looking Glass |editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Dudley |editor2-first=Maximillian E |editor2-last=Novak |title=The Wild Man Within: An Image in Western Thought from the Renaissance to Romanticism |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1972 |page=106|isbn=9780822975991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was used in reference to newly created man. "Savage" at that time could mean "wild beast" as well as "wild man".&lt;ref&gt;OED s.v. "savage" B.3.a.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase later became identified with the idealized picture of "nature's gentleman", which was an aspect of 18th-century [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]]. The noble savage achieved prominence as an [[oxymoron]]ic rhetorical device after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by English novelist [[Charles Dickens]], who some believe may have wished to disassociate himself from what he viewed as the "feminine" [[sentimentality]] of 18th and early 19th-century romantic [[primitivism]].{{efn|Grace Moore speculates that Dickens, although himself an abolitionist, was motivated by a wish to differentiate himself from what he believed was the feminine sentimentality and bad writing of female philanthropists and writers such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], with whom he, as a reformist writer, was often associated.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Moore, "Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'", ''The Dickensian'' 98:458 (2002): 236–243.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The idea that humans are essentially good is often attributed to the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]],{{Citation needed|reason=debate about the goodness of man goes back much earlier, in Christian philosophy, original sin is the concept of people being born with inherent sinfulness|date=February 2018}} a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] supporter of [[constitutional monarchy]]. In his ''Inquiry Concerning Virtue'' (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the [[Moral sense theory|moral sense]] in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings, rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular [[religion]]. Shaftesbury was reacting to [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s justification of an absolutist [[Centralized government|central state]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', "Chapter XIII", in which Hobbes famously holds that the [[state of nature]] is a "war of all against all" in which men's lives are "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". Hobbes further calls the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] an example of a contemporary people living in such a state. Although writers since antiquity had described people living in pre-civilized conditions, Hobbes is credited with inventing the term "State of Nature". [[Ross Harrison (academic)|Ross Harrison]] writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term."&lt;ref&gt;''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'', Ross Harrison, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is sometimes believed, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] never used the phrase ''noble savage'' (French ''[[:fr:bon sauvage|bon sauvage]]''). However, the character of the ''noble savage'' appeared in French literature at least as early as [[Jacques Cartier]] (coloniser of [[Québec]], speaking of the [[Iroquois]]) and [[Michel de Montaigne]] (philosopher, speaking of the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]]) in the 16th century.

==Pre-history of the noble savage==
[[File:Southerne Oroonoko 1776 performance.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Illustration of a 1776 performance of Oroonoko.|right|200px|Oroonoko kills Imoinda in a 1776 performance of [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[Oroonoko]].'']]

[[Tacitus]]' [[Germania (book)|''De origine et situ Germanorum'']] (''Germania''), written {{circa}} 98 AD, has been described as a predecessor of the modern noble savage concept, which started in the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Western literature|western European]] [[travel literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradies auf Erden?: Mythenbildung als Form von Fremdwahrnehmung : der Südsee-Mythos in Schlüsselphasen der deutschen Literatur Anja Hall Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 16th and 17th centuries, the figure of the indigene or "savage"—and later, increasingly, the "good savage"—was held up as a reproach to European civilization, then in the throes of the [[French Wars of Religion]] and [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (1572), some ten to twenty thousand men, women, and children were massacred by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mobs, chiefly in [[Paris]], but also throughout France. This horrifying breakdown of civil control was deeply disturbing to thoughtful people on both sides of the religious divide.

{{quotation|Foremost among the atrocities connected with the religious conflict was the St. Batholomew's massacre (August 224, 1572) ... The Parisian populace [was] inflamed by anti-Protestant preaching, and a general massacre ensued, devastating the Huguenot community of Paris. Bodies were stripped naked, mutilated, and thrown into the Seine. The massacres spread throughout France into the fall of 1572, spreading as far as Bordeaux [home of Montaigne]. ... Estimates of the total number of deaths vary widely; modern historians tend to accept the approximate number of ten thousand. ... Huguenots were not entirely innocent of massacres themselves|Ullrich Langer, "Montaigne's political and religious context", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Montaigne''&lt;ref&gt;"Montaigne's political and religious context" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Montaigne'' (Cambridge, 2005), p. 14 (cf. also Tom Conley, "The ''Essays'' and the New World" p. 80 in the same volume.)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In his famous essay "Of Cannibals" (1580),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/montaigne.html Essay "Of Cannibals"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel de Montaigne]]—himself a Catholic—reported that the [[Tupinambá people]] of Brazil ceremoniously eat the bodies of their dead enemies as a matter of honour. However, he reminded his readers that Europeans behave even more barbarously when they burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion (he implies): "One calls 'barbarism' whatever he is not accustomed to."

{{quotation|The cannibal practices are admitted [by Montaigne] but presented as part of a complex and balanced set of customs and beliefs which "make sense" in their own right. They are attached to a powerfully positive morality of valor and pride, one that would have been likely to appeal to early modern codes of honor, and they are contrasted with modes of behavior in the France of the wars of religion which appear as distinctly less attractive, such as torture and barbarous methods of execution (...)&lt;ref&gt;Terence Cave, ''How to Read Montaigne'' (London: Granta Books, 2007), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "Of Cannibals", Montaigne uses [[cultural relativism|cultural]] (but not [[moral relativism|moral]]) [[relativism]] for the purpose of satire. His cannibals are neither noble nor especially good, but not worse than 16th-century Europeans. In this [[Classical liberalism|classical]] [[Humanism|humanist]] view, [[Convention (norm)|customs]] differ but people everywhere are prone to cruelty, a quality that Montaigne detested.

{{quotation|In his ''Essais'' ... Montaigne discussed the first three wars of religion (1562–63; 1567–68; 1568–70) quite specifically; he had personally participated in them, on the side of the royal army, in southwestern France. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre led him to retire to his lands in the Périgord region, and remain silent on all public affairs until the 1580s. Thus, it seems that he was traumatized by the massacre. To him, cruelty was a criterion that differentiated the Wars of Religion from previous conflicts, which he idealized. Montaigne considered that three factors accounted for the shift from regular war to the carnage of civil war: popular intervention, religious demagogy and the never-ending aspect of the conflict..... He chose to depict cruelty through the image of hunting, which fitted with the tradition of condemning hunting for its association with blood and death, but it was still quite surprising, to the extent that this practice was part of the aristocratic way of life. Montaigne reviled hunting by describing it as an urban massacre scene. In addition, the man-animal relationship allowed him to define virtue, which he presented as the opposite of cruelty. … [as] a sort of natural benevolence based on ... personal feelings. … Montaigne associated the propensity to cruelty toward animals, with that exercised toward men. After all, following the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, the invented image of Charles IX shooting Huguenots from the Louvre palace window did combine the established reputation of the king as a hunter, with a stigmatization of hunting, a cruel and perverted custom, did it not?|David El Kenz|Massacres During the Wars of Religion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/Massacres-during-the-Wars-of-Religion?cs=print David El Kenz,"Massacres During the Wars of Religion", 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, ''The Fall of the Natural Man: the American Indian and the origins of comparative ethnology. Cambridge Iberian and Latin American Studies.''(Cambridge University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who witnessed it, may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans. He and other observers praised their simple manners and reported that they were incapable of lying.

European angst over [[colonialism]] inspired fictional treatments such as [[Aphra Behn]]'s novel ''[[Oroonoko]], or the Royal Slave'' (1688), about a [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in [[Suriname|Surinam]] in the [[West Indies]]. Behn's story was not primarily a protest against [[slavery]]; rather, it was written for money, and it met readers' expectations by following the conventions of the European [[romance novel]]la. The leader of the revolt, Oroonoko, is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince, and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a classical [[Golden Age]]. He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Behn's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright [[Thomas Southerne]], who stressed its sentimental aspects, and as time went on, it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism, remaining very popular throughout the 18th century.

==Origin of term==
In English, the phrase ''Noble Savage'' first appeared in poet [[John Dryden]]'s heroic play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1672):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I am as free as nature first made man,
Ere the base laws of servitude began,
When wild in woods the noble savage ran.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hero who speaks these words in Dryden's play is here denying the right of a prince to put him to death, on the grounds that he is not that prince's subject. These lines were quoted by Scott as the heading to Chapter 22 of his "A Legend of Montrose" (1819). "Savage" is better taken here in the sense of "wild beast", so that the phrase "noble savage" is to be read as a witty conceit meaning simply the beast that is above the other beasts, or man.

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologist]] Ter Ellingson believes that Dryden had picked up the expression "noble savage" from a 1609 travelogue about Canada by the French explorer [[Marc Lescarbot]], in which there was a chapter with the ironic heading: "The Savages are Truly Noble", meaning simply  that they enjoyed the right to hunt game, a privilege in France granted only to hereditary aristocrats. It is not known if Lescarbot was aware of Montaigne's stigmatization of the aristocratic pastime of hunting, though some authors believe he was familiar with Montaigne. Lescarbot's familiarity with Montaigne, is discussed by Ter Ellingson in ''The Myth of the Noble Savage''.&lt;ref&gt;The Myth of the Noble Savage, Ter Ellingson, (University of California, 2001), note p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dryden's day the word "savage" did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty now associated with it. Instead, as an adjective, it could as easily mean "wild", as in a wild flower, for example. Thus he wrote in 1697, 'the savage cherry grows. ...';.&lt;ref&gt;(OED 'Savage', A, I, 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar, Audrey Smedley, believes that: "English conceptions of 'the savage' were grounded in expansionist conflicts with Irish pastoralists and more broadly, in isolation from, and denigration of neighboring European peoples." and Ellingson agrees that "The ethnographic literature lends considerable support for such arguments"&lt;ref&gt;(Ellingson [2001], p. 389).&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the [[Stock character|stock figure]] that in English is called the "noble savage" has always been simply "le bon sauvage", "the good wild man", a term without any of the paradoxical frisson of the English one. [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] is generally credited for being at the origin of this myth in his [[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]] (1580), especially "Of Coaches" and "Of Cannibals". This character, an idealized portrayal of "Nature's Gentleman", was an aspect of 18th-century [[sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]], along with other stock characters such as, the Virtuous Milkmaid, the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master (such as [[Sancho Panza]] and [[Figaro (character in operas and plays)|Figaro]], among countless others), and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born. The use of stock characters (especially in theater) to express moral truths derives from classical antiquity and goes back to [[Theophrastus]]'s ''Characters'', a work that enjoyed a great vogue in the 17th and 18th centuries and was translated by [[Jean de La Bruyère]]. The practice largely died out with advent of 19th-century [[Literary realism|realism]] but lasted much longer in genre literature, such as adventure stories, Westerns, and, arguably, science fiction. Nature's Gentleman, whether European-born or exotic, takes his place in this cast of characters, along with the Wise Egyptian, Persian, and Chinaman. "But now, alongside the Good Savage, the Wise Egyptian claims his place." Some of these types are discussed by Paul Hazard in ''The European Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;''The European Mind'', Paul Hazard (1680–1715) (Cleveland, Ohio: Meridian Books [1937], 1969), pp. 14–24 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;

He had always existed, from the time of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', where he appears as [[Enkiddu]], the wild-but-good man who lives with animals. Another instance is the untutored-but-noble medieval knight, [[Parsifal]]. The [[Bible|Biblical]] shepherd boy [[David]] falls into this category. The association of virtue with withdrawal from society—and specifically from cities—was a familiar theme in religious literature.

''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' an Islamic philosophical tale (or thought experiment) by [[Ibn Tufail]] from 12th-century [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]], straddles the divide between the religious and the secular. The tale is of interest because it was known to the [[New England Puritan culture and recreation|New England Puritan]] divine, [[Cotton Mather]]. Translated into English (from Latin) in 1686 and 1708, it tells the story of Hayy, a [[Feral child|wild child]], raised by a gazelle, without human contact, on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean. Purely through the use of his reason, Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society, where he revealed to be a believer of [[Natural Theology|natural religion]], which Cotton Mather, as a Christian Divine, identified with [[Primitive Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle R. Quiggle, “Ibn Tufayl's Hayy Ibn Yaqdan in New England: A Spanish-Islamic Tale in Cotton Mather's ''Christian Philosopher''?” ''Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory'', 64: 2 (Summer 2008): 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian, but not a Noble Savage.

The ''locus classicus'' of the 18th-century portrayal of the American Indian are the famous lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s "[[Essay on Man]]" (1734):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
His soul proud Science never taught to stray
Far as the solar walk or milky way;
Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,
Behind the cloud-topp'd hill, a humbler heav'n;
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,
Some happier island in the wat'ry waste,
Where slaves once more their native land behold,
No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold!
To be, contents his natural desire;
He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire:
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
His faithful dog shall bear him company.''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Pope, writing in 1734, the Indian was a purely abstract figure— "poor" either meant ironically, or applied because he was uneducated and a heathen, but also happy because he was living close to Nature. This view reflects the typical [[Age of Reason]] belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same as well as a Deistic conception of natural religion (although Pope, like Dryden, was Catholic). Pope's phrase, "Lo the Poor Indian", became almost as famous as Dryden's "noble savage" and, in the 19th century, when more people began to have first hand knowledge of and conflict with the Indians, would be used derisively for similar sarcastic effect.{{efn|In 1859, journalist Horace Greeley, famous for his advice to "Go west, young man", used "Lo, The Poor Indian" as the title for a letter written from Colorado:
{{quotation|I have learned to appreciate better than hitherto, and to make more allowance for, the dislike, aversion, contempt wherewith Indians are usually regarded by their white neighbors, and have been since the days of the Puritans. It needs but little familiarity with the actual, palpable aborigines to convince anyone that the poetic Indian—the Indian of Cooper and Longfellow—is only visible to the poet's eye. To the prosaic observer, the average Indian of the woods and prairies is a being who does little credit to human nature—a slave of appetite and sloth, never emancipated from the tyranny of one animal passion save by the more ravenous demands of another. As I passed over those magnificent bottoms of the Kansas, which form the reservations of the Delawares, Potawatamies, etc., constituting the very best corn-lands on earth, and saw their owners sitting around the doors of their lodges at the height of the planting season and in as good, bright planting weather as sun and soil ever made, I could not help saying, "These people must die out—there is no help for them. God has given this earth to those who will subdue and cultivate it, and it is vain to struggle against His righteous decree."|"Lo!

The term was also “a sarcastic reference to those eastern humanitarians whose idea of the Indian was so at variance with the frontiersman's bloodthirsty savage. "The ''Leavenworth, Kansas, Times and Conservative'', for example, commented indignantly on the story of Thomas Alderdice, whose wife was captured and killed by Cheyennes: 'We wish some philanthropists who talk about civilizing the Indians, could have heard this unfortunate and almost broken-hearted man tell his story. We think they would at least have wavered a little in their opinion of the Lo family'"&lt;ref&gt;Louise Barnett, in ''Touched by Fire: the Life, Death, and Mythic Afterlife of George Armstrong Custer'' (University of Nebraska Press [1986], 2006), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Attributes of romantic primitivism==
{{quotation|On our arrival upon this coast we found there a savage race who ... lived by hunting and by the fruits which the trees spontaneously produced. These people ... were greatly surprised and alarmed by the sight of our ships and arms and retired to the mountains. But since our soldiers were curious to see the country and hunt deer, they were met by some of these savage fugitives. The leaders of the savages accosted them thus: "We abandoned for you, the pleasant sea-coast, so that we have nothing left but these almost inaccessible mountains: at least it is just that you leave us in peace and liberty. Go, and never forget that you owe your lives to our feeling of humanity. Never forget that it was from a people whom you call rude and savage that you receive this lesson in gentleness and generosity. ... We abhor that brutality which, under the gaudy names of ambition and glory, ... sheds the blood of men who are all brothers.  ...  We value health, frugality, liberty, and vigor of body and mind: the love of virtue, the fear of the gods, a natural goodness toward our neighbors, attachment to our friends, fidelity to all the world, moderation in prosperity, fortitude in adversity, courage always bold to speak the truth, and abhorrence of flattery. ...  If the offended gods so far blind you as to make you reject peace, you will find, when it is too late, that the people who are moderate and lovers of peace are the most formidable in war.|[[Fénelon]]|[[Les Aventures de Télémaque|The Adventures of Telemachus]] (1699)&lt;ref&gt;François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, Encounter with the Mandurians, in Chapter IX of ''Telemachus, son of Ulysses'', translated by Patrick Riley (Cambridge University Press, [1699] 1994), pp. 130–131. This didactic novel (arguably the first "boys' book") by the Archbishop of Cambrai, tutor to the seven-year-old grandson of Louis XIV, was perhaps the most internationally popular book of the 18th and early 19th centuries, a favorite of [[Montesquieu]], [[Rousseau]], [[Herder]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], and countless others. Patrick Riley's translation is based on that of Tobias Smollett, 1776 (op cit p. xvii).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1st century AD, sterling qualities such as those enumerated above by Fénelon (excepting perhaps belief in the brotherhood of man) had been attributed by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' to the German barbarians, in pointed contrast to the softened, Romanized [[Gauls]]. By inference Tacitus was criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots—which was the perennial function of such comparisons. Tacitus's Germans did not inhabit a "[[Golden Age]]" of ease but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which he saw as preferable to the decadent softness of civilized life. In antiquity this form of "hard primitivism", whether admired or deplored (both attitudes were common), co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the "soft primitivism" of visions of a lost [[Golden Age]] of ease and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;For the distinction between "hard" and "soft" primitivism see [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'', Baltimore, I, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

As art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains:{{quotation|There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas,  conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.|[[Erwin Panofsky]], art historian&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Et in Arcadia Ego", in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 18th century the debates about primitivism centered around the examples of the people of Scotland as often as the American Indians. The rude ways of the Highlanders were often scorned, but their toughness also called forth a degree of admiration among "hard" primitivists, just as that of the [[Sparta]]ns and the Germans had done in antiquity. One Scottish writer described his Highland countrymen this way:{{quotation|They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are incredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather, that in traveling, even when the ground is covered with snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their plaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible ...|[[Tobias Smollett]]|[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Smollett]], ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' ([1771] London: Penguin Books, 1967), p. 292. One of the characters in Smollett's ''Humphry Clinker'', Lieutenant Lismahago, is a kind of ludicrous noble savage. A proud and irascible Scotsman of good family and advancing years, Lismahago has been so poorly requited by the government for his services in the Canadian wars that he is planning to return to Canada to live out his days with his Native American common-law wife, in squalor but with more honor and decency than would be possible as a pauper at home.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reaction to Hobbes==
Debates about "soft" and "hard" primitivism intensified with the publication in 1651 of [[Hobbes]]'s ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (or ''Commonwealth''), a justification of absolute monarchy. Hobbes, a "hard Primitivist", flatly asserted that life in a [[state of nature]] was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"—a "war of all against all":

{{quotation|Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of Warre, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short|Hobbes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3207 ''Leviathan'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Reacting to the wars of religion of his own time and the previous century, he maintained that the absolute rule of a king was the only possible alternative to the otherwise inevitable violence and disorder of civil war. Hobbes' hard primitivism may have been as venerable as the tradition of soft primitivism, but his use of it was new. He used it to argue that the state was founded on a [[social contract]] in which men voluntarily gave up their liberty in return for the peace and security provided by total surrender to an absolute ruler, whose legitimacy stemmed from the Social Contract and not from God.

Hobbes' vision of the natural depravity of man inspired fervent disagreement among those who opposed absolute government. His most influential and effective opponent in the last decade of the 17th century was [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]. Shaftesbury countered that, contrary to Hobbes, humans in a state of nature were neither good nor bad, but that they possessed a moral sense based on the emotion of sympathy, and that this emotion was the source and foundation of human goodness and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. Like his contemporaries (all of whom who were educated by reading classical authors such as [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Horace]]), Shaftesbury admired the simplicity of life of classical antiquity. He urged a would-be author “to search for that simplicity of manners, and innocence of behavior, which has been often known among mere savages; ere they were corrupted by our commerce” (''Advice to an Author'', Part III.iii). Shaftesbury's denial of the innate depravity of man was taken up by contemporaries such as the popular Irish essayist [[Richard Steele]] (1672–1729), who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education. Influenced by Shaftesbury and his followers, 18th-century readers, particularly in England, were swept up by the cult of [[Sensibility]] that grew up around Shaftesbury's  concepts of [[sympathy]] and benevolence.

Meanwhile, in France, where those who criticized government or Church authority could be imprisoned without trial or hope of appeal, primitivism was used primarily as a way to protest the repressive rule of Louis XIV and XV, while avoiding censorship. Thus, in the beginning of the 18th century, a French travel writer, the [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Baron de Lahontan]], who had actually lived among the [[Wyandot people|Huron Indians]], put potentially dangerously radical [[Deist]] and egalitarian arguments in the mouth of a Canadian Indian, Adario, who was perhaps the most striking and significant figure of the "good" (or "noble") savage, as we understand it now, to make his appearance on the historical stage:

{{quotation|Adario sings the praises of Natural Religion. ... As against society he puts forward a sort of primitive Communism, of which the certain fruits are Justice and a happy life. ... He looks with compassion on poor civilized man—no courage, no strength, incapable of providing himself with food and shelter: a degenerate, a moral ''cretin'', a figure of fun in his blue coat, his red hose, his black hat, his white plume and his green ribands. He never really lives because he is always torturing the life out of himself to clutch at wealth and honors which, even if he wins them, will prove to be but glittering illusions. ... For science and the arts are but the parents of corruption. The Savage obeys the will of Nature, his kindly mother, therefore he is happy. It is civilized folk who are the real barbarians.|Paul Hazard|The European Mind&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Hazard, ''The European Mind (1680–1715)'' ([1937], 1969), pp. 13–14, and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Published in Holland, Lahontan's writings, with their controversial attacks on established religion and social customs, were immensely popular. Over twenty editions were issued between 1703 and 1741, including editions in French, English, Dutch and German.

{{quotation|Interest in the remote peoples of the earth, in the unfamiliar civilizations of the East, in the untutored races of America and Africa, was vivid in France in the 18th century. Everyone knows how Voltaire and Montesquieu used Hurons or Persians to hold up the glass to Western manners and morals, as Tacitus used the Germans to criticize the society of Rome. But very few ever look into the seven volumes of the Abbé Raynal’s ''History of the Two Indies'', which appeared in 1772. It is however one of the most remarkable books of the century. Its immediate practical importance lay in the array of facts which it furnished to the friends of humanity in the movement against negro slavery. But it was also an effective attack on the Church and the sacerdotal system. ... Raynal brought home to the conscience of Europeans the miseries which had befallen the natives of the New World through the Christian conquerors and their priests. He was not indeed an enthusiastic preacher of Progress. He was unable to decide between the comparative advantages of the savage state of nature and the most highly cultivated society. But he observes that “the human race is what we wish to make it", that the felicity of man depends entirely on the improvement of legislation, and ... his view is generally optimistic.|J.B.

Many of the most incendiary passages in Raynal's book, one of the bestsellers of the eighteenth century, especially in the Western Hemisphere, are now known to have been in fact written by [[Diderot]]. Reviewing Jonathan Israel's ''Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights'', Jeremy Jennings, notes that ''The History of the Two Indies'', in the opinion of Jonathan Israel, was the text that "made a world revolution" by delivering "the most devastating single blow to the existing order":

{{quotation|Usually (and incorrectly) attributed to the pen of the Abbé Raynal, its ostensible theme of Europe's colonial expansion allowed Diderot not only to depict the atrocities and greed of colonialism but also to develop an argument in defense of universal human rights, equality, and a life free from tyranny and fanaticism.

In the later 18th century, the published voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] seemed to open a glimpse into an unspoiled [[Garden of Eden|Edenic culture]] that still existed in the [[Christianization|un-Christianized]] [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]]. Their popularity inspired [[Diderot]]'s ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville|Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville]]'' (1772), a scathing critique of European sexual hypocrisy and colonial exploitation.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had negotiated with the Indians during the French and Indian War, protested vehemently against the Paxton massacre that took place at Conestoga, in western Pennsylvania, of December 1763, in which white vigilantes massacred Indian women and children, many of whom had converted to Christianity. Franklin himself personally organized a Quaker militia to control the white population and "strengthen the government". In his pamphlet ''[[Bagatelles and satires (Benjamin Franklin)#Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America|Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America]]'' (1784), Franklin deplored the use of the term "savages" for Native Americans:

{{quote|Savages we call them, because their manners differ from ours, which we think the perfection of civility; they think the same of theirs.|author=[[Benjamin Franklin]]&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt;}}

Franklin used the massacres to illustrate his point that no race had a monopoly on virtue, likening the Paxton vigilantes to  "Christian White Savages'". Franklin cried out to a just God to punish those who carried the Bible in one hand and the hatchet in the other: 'O ye unhappy Perpetrators of this Horrid Wickedness!'"&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt; Franklin praised the Indian way of life, their customs of hospitality, their councils, which reached agreement by discussion and consensus, and noted that many white men had voluntarily given up the purported advantages of civilization to live among them, but that the opposite was rare.

{{quotation|Franklin's writings on American Indians were remarkably free of ethnocentricism, although he often used words such as "savages," which carry more prejudicial connotations in the twentieth century than in his time. Franklin's cultural relativism was perhaps one of the purest expressions of Enlightenment assumptions that stressed racial equality and the universality of moral sense among peoples. Systematic racism was not called into service until a rapidly expanding frontier demanded that enemies be dehumanized during the rapid, historically inevitable westward movement of the nineteenth century. Franklin's respect for cultural diversity did not reappear widely as an assumption in Euro-American thought until Franz Boas and others revived it around the end of the nineteenth century. Franklin's writings on Indians express the fascination of the Enlightenment with nature, the natural origins of man and society, and natural (or human) rights. They are likewise imbued with a search (which amounted at times almost to a ransacking of the past) for alternatives to monarchy as a form of government, and to orthodox state-recognized churches as a form of worship.|[[Bruce E. Johansen]]|Forgotten Founders: Benjamin Franklin, the Iroquois, and the Rationale for the American Revolution&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt;
}}

Though retrospectively it may seem to us that Franklin may have idealized the Indians to make a rhetorical point, the phrase "noble savage" never appears in his writings.

==Erroneous identification of Rousseau with the noble savage==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], like Shaftesbury, also insisted that man was born with the potential for goodness; and he, too, argued that civilization, with its envy and self-consciousness, has made men bad. In his ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men'' (1754), Rousseau maintained that man in a State of Nature had been a solitary, ape-like creature, who was not ''méchant'' (bad), as Hobbes had maintained, but (like some other animals) had an "innate repugnance to see others of his kind suffer" (and this natural sympathy constituted the Natural Man's one-and-only natural virtue).&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy (1923, 1948) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Rousseau's fellow ''[[philosophe]]'', Voltaire, objecting to Rousseau's egalitarianism, who charged him with primitivism and accused him of wanting to make people go back and walk on all fours.{{efn|Voltaire was no believer in human equality: "It is notorious that Voltaire objected to the education of laborers' children"&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gay]], ''The Enlightenment: The Science of Freedom'' (New York: W.W. Norton, [1969] 1977), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Because Rousseau was the preferred philosopher of the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] of the [[French Revolution]], he, above all, became tarred with the accusation of promoting the notion of the "noble savage", especially during the polemics about [[Imperialism]] and [[scientific racism]] in the last half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Ter Ellingson (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the phrase "noble savage" does not occur in any of Rousseau's writings.{{efn|In a review of a book discussing [[Steven Pinker]], Peter Gay writes "As far as the noble savage is concerned, that phrase is from Dryden and does not appear in Rousseau's writings. In the years I taught the history of political theory at Columbia to a sizable class of undergraduates, I would offer students a hundred dollars if they could find "Noble Savage" anywhere in Rousseau. I never had to pay up"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/016_01/3519 Peter Gay, "Breeding Is Fundamental: Jenny Davidson reflects on Enlightenment ideas about human perfectibility", ''Book Forum'' &amp;#91;April/May 2009&amp;#93;].&lt;/ref&gt;}} In fact, Rousseau arguably shared Hobbes' pessimistic view of humankind, except that as Rousseau saw it, Hobbes had made the error of assigning it to too early a stage in human evolution. According to the historian of ideas, Arthur O. Lovejoy:

{{quotation|The notion that Rousseau’s ''Discourse on Inequality'' was essentially a glorification of the State of Nature, and that its influence tended to wholly or chiefly to promote "Primitivism" is one of the most persistent historical errors.|[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A.

}}

In his ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'', Rousseau, anticipating the language of Darwin, states that as the animal-like human species increased there arose a "formidable struggle for existence" between it and other species for food.&lt;ref&gt;(Lovejoy (1960), p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; It was then, under the pressure of necessity, that ''le caractère spécifique de l'espèce humaine''—the specific quality that distinguished man from the beasts—emerged—intelligence, a power, meager at first but yet capable of an "almost unlimited development". Rousseau calls this power the ''faculté de se perfectionner''—perfectibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy attributes the invention of the term to [[Michel-Étienne Turgot|Turgot]] in 1750, but, according to him, it was Rousseau who gave it wide currency. See Lovejoy (1960), p. 24,&lt;/ref&gt; Man invented tools, discovered fire, and in short, began to emerge from the state of nature. Yet at this stage, men also began to compare himself to others: "It is easy to see. ... that all our labors are directed upon two objects only, namely, for oneself, the commodities of life, and consideration on the part of others." ''Amour propre''—the desire for consideration (self regard), Rousseau calls a "factitious feeling arising, only in society, which leads a man to think more highly of himself than of any other." This passion began to show itself with the first moment of human self-consciousness, which was also that of the first step of human progress: "It is this desire for reputation, honors, and preferment which devours us all ... this rage to be distinguished, that we own what is best and worst in men—our virtues and our vices, our sciences and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers—in short, a vast number of evil things and a small number of good." It is this "which inspires men to all the evils which they inflict upon one another.".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'', as quoted in Lovejoy (1960), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, Rousseau praises the newly discovered "savage" tribes (whom Rousseau does ''not'' consider in a "state of nature"), as living a life that is simpler and more egalitarian than that of the Europeans;  and he sometimes praises this "third stage" it in terms that could be confused with the romantic primitivism fashionable in his times. He also identifies ancient primitive communism under a patriarchy, such as he believes characterized the "youth" of mankind, as perhaps the happiest state and perhaps also illustrative of  how man was intended by God to live. But these stages are not all good, but rather are mixtures of good and bad. According to Lovejoy, Rousseau's basic view of human nature after the emergence of social living is basically identical to that of Hobbes.&lt;ref&gt;"Rousseau's theory of human nature here, in short, is identical with that of Hobbes", Lovejoy (1960), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rousseau does not believe that it is possible or desirable to go back to a primitive state. It is only by acting together in civil society and binding themselves to its laws that men become men; and only a properly constituted society and reformed system of education could make men good.  According to Lovejoy:

{{quotation|For Rousseau, man's good lay in departing from his "natural" state—but not too much; "perfectability" up to a certain point was desirable, though beyond that point an evil. Not its infancy but its ''jeunesse'' [youth] was the best age of the human race. The distinction may seem to us slight enough; but in the mid-eighteenth century it amounted to an abandonment of the stronghold of the primitivistic position. Nor was this the whole of the difference. As compared with the then-conventional pictures of the savage state, Rousseau's account even of this third stage is far less idyllic; and it is so because of his fundamentally unfavorable view of human nature ''quâ'' human. ... His savages are quite unlike Dryden's Indians: "Guiltless men, that danced away their time, / Fresh as the groves and happy as their clime—" or Mrs. Aphra Behn's natives of Surinam, who represented an absolute idea of the first state of innocence, "before men knew how to sin." The men in Rousseau's "nascent society" already had 'bien des querelles et des combats [many quarrels and fights]'; ''l'amour propre'' was already manifest in them ... and slights or affronts were consequently visited with ''vengeances terribles.''&lt;ref&gt;See Lovejoy (1960), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For Rousseau the remedy was not in going back to the primitive but in reorganizing society on the basis of a properly drawn up social compact, so as to "draw from the very evil from which we suffer [i.e., civilization and progress] the remedy which shall cure it." Lovejoy concludes that Rousseau's doctrine, as expressed in his ''Discourse on Inequality'':

{{quotation|declares that there is a dual process going on through history; on the one hand, an indefinite progress in all those powers and achievements which express merely the potency of man's intellect; on the other hand, an increasing estrangement of men from one another, an intensification of ill-will and mutual fear, culminating in a monstrous epoch of universal conflict and mutual destruction [i.e., the ''fourth'' stage in which we now find ourselves]. And the chief cause of the latter process Rousseau, following Hobbes and Mandeville, found, as we have seen, in that unique passion of the self-conscious animal – pride, self esteem, ''le besoin de se mettre au dessus des autres'' ["the need to put oneself above others"]. A large survey of history does not belie these generalizations, and the history of the period since Rousseau wrote lends them a melancholy verisimilitude. Precisely the two processes, which he described have ... been going on upon a scale beyond all precedent: immense progress in man's knowledge and in his powers over nature, and at the same time a steady increase of rivalries, distrust, hatred and at last "the most horrible state of war" ... [Moreover Rousseau] failed to realize fully how strongly ''amour propre'' tended to assume a collective form ... in pride of race, of nationality, of class.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy (1960), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==19th century belief in progress and the fall of the natural man==
During the 19th century the idea that men were everywhere and always the same that had characterized both classical antiquity and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was exchanged for a more organic and dynamic evolutionary concept of human history. Advances in technology now made the indigenous man and his simpler way of life appear, not only inferior, but also, even his defenders agreed, foredoomed by the inexorable advance of [[social progress|progress]] to inevitable extinction. The sentimentalized "primitive" ceased to figure as a moral reproach to the decadence of the effete European, as in previous centuries. Instead, the argument shifted to a discussion of whether his demise should be considered a desirable or regrettable eventuality. As the century progressed, native peoples and their traditions increasingly became a foil serving to highlight the accomplishments of Europe and the expansion of the European Imperial powers, who justified their policies on the basis of a presumed racial and cultural superiority.&lt;ref&gt;See reference to Frederick E. Hoxie's review of Ter Ellingson's ''Myth of the Noble Savage'' in note 32 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles Dickens 1853 article on "The Noble Savage" in ''Household Words''==
In 1853 [[Charles Dickens]] wrote a scathingly sarcastic review in his weekly magazine ''[[Household Words]]'' of painter [[George Catlin]]'s show of American Indians when it visited England. In his essay, entitled [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/2529/ "The Noble Savage"], Dickens expressed repugnance for Indians and their way of life in no uncertain terms, recommending that they ought to be “civilised off the face of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/2529/ "The Noble Savage"&lt;/ref&gt; (Dickens's essay refers back to Dryden's well-known use of the term, not to Rousseau.) Dickens's scorn for those unnamed individuals, who, like Catlin, he alleged, misguidedly exalted the so-called "noble savage", was limitless. In reality, Dickens maintained, Indians were dirty, cruel, and constantly fighting among themselves. Dickens's satire on Catlin and others like him who might find something to admire in the American Indians or African bushmen is a notable turning point in the history of the use of the phrase.&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"&gt;For an account of Dickens's article see Moore, "Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'" (2002): 236–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like others who would henceforth write about the topic, Dickens begins by disclaiming a belief in the "noble savage":
{{quotation|To come to the point at once, I beg to say that I have not the least belief in the Noble Savage. I consider him a prodigious nuisance and an enormous superstition. ... I don't care what he calls me. I call him a savage, and I call a savage a something highly desirable to be civilized off the face of the earth.... The noble savage sets a king to reign over him, to whom he submits his life and limbs without a murmur or question and whose whole life is passed chin deep in a lake of blood; but who, after killing incessantly, is in his turn killed by his relations and friends the moment a grey hair appears on his head. All the noble savage's wars with his fellow-savages (and he takes no pleasure in anything else) are wars of extermination—which is the best thing I know of him, and the most comfortable to my mind when I look at him. He has no moral feelings of any kind, sort, or description; and his "mission" may be summed up as simply diabolical.|Charles Dickens&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"/&gt;
}}
Dickens' essay was arguably a pose of manly, no-nonsense realism and a defense of Christianity. At the end of it his tone becomes more recognizably humanitarian, as he maintains that, although the virtues of the savage are mythical and his way of life inferior and doomed, he still deserves to be treated no differently than if he were an Englishman of genius, such as Newton or Shakespeare:

{{quotation|To conclude as I began. My position is, that if we have anything to learn from the Noble Savage, it is what to avoid. His virtues are a fable; his happiness is a delusion; his nobility, nonsense. We have no greater justification for being cruel to the miserable object, than for being cruel to a WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE or an ISAAC NEWTON; but he passes away before an immeasurably better and higher power [i.e., that of Christianity] than ever ran wild in any earthly woods, and the world will be all the better when this place knows him no more.|Charles Dickens&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"/&gt;
}}

==Scapegoating the Inuit: cannibalism and Sir John Franklin's lost expedition==
Although Charles Dickens had ridiculed positive depictions of Native Americans as portrayals of so-called "noble" savages, he made an exception (at least initially) in the case of the Inuit, whom he called  “loving children of the north”,  “forever happy with their lot,” “whether they are hungry or full”, and “gentle loving savages”, who, despite a tendency to steal, have a “quiet, amiable character” ("Our Phantom Ship on an Antediluvian Cruise", ''Household Words'', April 16, 1851). However he soon reversed this rosy assessment, when on October 23, 1854, ''The Times'' of London published a report by explorer-physician [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] of the discovery by Eskimos of the remains of the [[Franklin's lost expedition|lost Franklin expedition]] along with unmistakable evidence of cannibalism among members of the party:

{{quotation|From the mutilated state of many of the corpses and the contents of the kettles, it is evident that our wretched countrymen had been driven to the last resource—cannibalism—as a means of prolonging existence.
}}

Franklin's widow and other surviving relatives and indeed the nation as a whole were shocked to the core and refused to accept these reports, which appeared to undermine the whole assumption of the cultural superiority of the heroic white explorer-scientist and the imperial project generally. Instead, they attacked the reliability of the Eskimos who had made the gruesome discovery and called them liars. An editorial in ''The Times'' called for further investigation:

{{quotation|to arrive at a more satisfactory conclusion with regard to the fate of poor Franklin and his friends . ... Is the story told by the Esquimaux the true one? Like all savages they are liars, and certainly would not scruple at the utterance of any falsehood which might, in their opinion, shield them from the vengeance of the white man."&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Nayder, “The Cannibal, the Nurse, and the Cook in Dickens’s ‘The Frozen Deep'”, ''Victorian Literature and Culture'' 19 (1991):1.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

This line was energetically taken up by Dickens, who wrote in his weekly magazine:

{{quotation|It is impossible to form an estimate of the character of any race of savages from their deferential behavior to the white man while he is strong. The mistake has been made again and again; and the moment the white man has appeared in the new aspect of being weaker than the savage, the savage has changed and sprung upon him. There are pious persons who, in their practice, with a strange inconsistency, claim for every child born to civilization all innate depravity, and for every child born to the woods and wilds all innate virtue. We believe every savage to be in his heart covetous, treacherous, and cruel; and we have yet to learn what knowledge the white man—lost, houseless, shipless, apparently forgotten by his race, plainly famine-stricken, weak frozen, helpless, and dying—has of the gentleness of the Esquimaux nature.|Charles Dickens|The Lost Arctic Voyagers, Household Words, December 2, 1854.
}}

Dr. John Rae rebutted Dickens in two articles in ''Household Words'': “The Lost Arctic Voyagers”, ''Household Words'', No. 248 (December 23, 1854), and "Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty", ''Household Words'', No. 249 (December 30, 1854). Though he did not call them noble, Dr. Rae, who had lived among the Inuit, defended them as  “dutiful” and “a bright example to the most civilized people”, comparing them favorably with the undisciplined crew of the Franklin expedition, whom he suggested were ill-treated and "would have mutinied under privation", and moreover with the lower classes in England or Scotland generally.&lt;ref&gt;See Lillian Nayder (1991), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Nadyer notes: In their order of appearance, Dickens’s articles are: 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers,' (December 2, 1854); 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers' (December 9, 1854); 'The Lost English Sailors' (February 14, 1857); and 'Official Patriotism' (April 25, 1857). Dr. Rae’s articles are 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers' (December 23, 1854); 'Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty' (December 30, 1854); and 'Sir John Franklin and His Crews' (February 3, 1855)".}}

Dickens and Wilkie Collins subsequently collaborated on a melodramatic play, "[[The Frozen Deep]]", about the menace of cannibalism in the far north, in which "the villainous role assigned to the Eskimos in ''Household Words'' is assumed by a working class Scotswoman.&lt;ref&gt;(Nayder [1991], p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Frozen Deep'' was performed as a benefit organized by Dickens and attended by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and Emperor Leopold II of Belgium, among others, to fund a memorial to the Franklin Expedition. (Dr. Rae himself was Scots).

Rae's respect for the Inuit and his refusal to scapegoat them in the Franklin affair arguably harmed his career. Lady Franklin's campaign to glorify the dead of her husband's expedition, aided and abetted by Dickens, resulted in his being more or less shunned by the British establishment. Although it was not Franklin but Rae who in 1848 discovered the last link in the much-sought-after Northwest Passage, Rae was never awarded a knighthood and died in obscurity in London. (In comparison fellow Scot and contemporary explorer David Livingstone was knighted and buried with full imperial honors in Westminster Abbey). However, modern historians have confirmed Rae's discovery of the Northwest Passage and the accuracy of his report on cannibalism among Franklin's crew.&lt;ref&gt;On cannibalism, see, for example: [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article6912227.ece.  Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, "The Arctic heart of darkness: How heroic lies replaced hideous reality after the grim death of John Franklin", ''Times Literary Supplement'', Nov. 11, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian author [[Ken McGoogan]], a specialist on Arctic exploration, states that Rae's willingness to learn and adopt the ways of indigenous Arctic peoples made him stand out as the foremost specialist of his time in cold-climate survival and travel. Rae's respect for Inuit customs, traditions, and skills was contrary to the prejudiced belief of many 19th-century Europeans that native peoples had no valuable technical knowledge or information to impart.&lt;ref&gt;See Ken McGoogan, ''Fatal Passage: The True Story of John Rae, the Arctic Hero Time Forgot'' (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael introduced into the UK Parliament a motion proposing that the House "regrets that Dr Rae was never awarded the public recognition that was his due". In March 2009 Carmichael introduced a further motion urging Parliament to formally state it "regrets that memorials to Sir John Franklin outside the Admiralty headquarters and inside Westminster Abbey still inaccurately describe Franklin as the first to discover the [North West] passage, and calls on the Ministry of Defence and the Abbey authorities to take the necessary steps to clarify the true position."

Dickens's racism, like that of many Englishmen, became markedly worse after the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] of 1857 in India.

{{quotation|The cruelties of the Sepoy natives [toward the whites] have inflamed the nation to a degree unprecedented within my memory. Peace Societies, Aborigines Protection Societies, and societies for the reformation of criminals are silent. There is one cry for revenge.|Thomas Babington Macaulay|Diary&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ellingson (2001), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

It was said that Dickens's racism, “grew progressively more illiberal over the course of his career".&lt;ref&gt;William Oddie ''Dickens and Carlyle: the Question of Influence'' (London: Centenary) pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Dickens and the Indian Mutiny”, ''Dickensian'' 68 (January 1972), 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myron Magnet, ''Dickens and the Social Order'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Moore, on the other hand, argues that Dickens, a staunch  abolitionist and opponent of imperialism, had views on racial matters that were a good deal more complex than previous critics have suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Moore, ''Dickens And Empire: Discourses Of Class, Race And Colonialism In The Works Of Charles Dickens (Nineteenth Century Series)'' (Ashgate: 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This event, and the virtually contemporaneous occurrence of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1864), which threatened to, and then did, put an end to slavery, coincided with a polarization of attitudes exemplified by the phenomenon of [[scientific racism]].

==Scientific racism==
In 1860, [[John Crawfurd]] and [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] mounted a defense of British [[imperialism]] based on "[[scientific racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Ellingson (2001), pp. 249–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfurd, in alliance with Hunt, took over the presidency of the [[Ethnological Society of London]], which was an offshoot of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]], founded with the mission to defend indigenous peoples against slavery and colonial exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1843raigbi.html History page: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]. The Ethnological Society later merged with the [[Anthropological Society of London]] to form the Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Invoking "science" and "realism", the two men derided their "philanthropic" predecessors for believing in human equality and for not recognizing that mankind was divided into superior and inferior races. Crawfurd, who opposed [[Darwinian evolution]], "denied any unity to mankind, insisting on immutable, hereditary, and timeless differences in racial character, principal amongst which was the 'very great' difference in 'intellectual capacity.'" For Crawfurd, the races had been created separately and were different species. Crawfurd was Scots, and thought the Scots "race" superior to all others; whilst Hunt, on the other hand, believed in the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon "race". Crawfurd and Hunt routinely accused those who disagreed with them of believing in "Rousseau's Noble Savage". The pair ultimately quarreled because Hunt believed in slavery and Crawfurd did not.{{efn|Hunt went on to found the rival Anthropological Society of London, with a mission of "promoting the study of Anthropology in a strictly scientific manner" and focused on the issue of race. Like the Ethnological Society, Hunt's Anthropological Society later merged into the Royal Anthropological Institute.}} "As Ter Ellingson demonstrates, Crawfurd was responsible for re-introducing the Pre-Rousseauian concept of 'the Noble Savage' to modern anthropology, attributing it wrongly and quite deliberately to Rousseau.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/foreign_bodies/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html |title=John Crawfurd – 'two separate races' | publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an otherwise rather lukewarm review of Ellingson's book in ''[[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]]'' 4:1 (Spring 2003), Frederick E. Hoxie writes:

{{quotation|For early modern scholars from [St. Thomas] More to Rousseau, descriptions of Indian cultures could provide opportunities to criticize “civilization.” After Hunt and Crawfurd—or at least at about the middle of the 19th century, when both imperial ambition and racial ideology was hardening into national policy in Europe and the U.S.—Indians became foils of a different kind: people whose traditions underscored the accomplishments of Europe. The imperial powers were now the models of human achievement. Ellingson sees this shift and shows us how profoundly it affected popular conceptions of Native people.|Frederick E. Hoxie
}}

"If Rousseau was not the inventor of the Noble Savage, who was?" writes Ellingson,

{{quotation|One who turns for help to [Hoxie Neale] Fairchild's 1928 study,&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie Neale Fairchild, ''The Noble Savage: A Study in Romantic Naturalism'' (New York, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium of citations from romantic writings on the "savage" may be surprised to find [his book] ''The Noble Savage'' almost completely lacking in references to its nominal subject. That is, although Fairchild assembles hundreds of quotations from ethnographers, philosophers, novelists, poets, and playwrights from the 17th century to the 19th century, showing a rich variety of ways in which writers romanticized and idealized those who Europeans considered "savages", almost none of them explicitly refer to something called the "Noble Savage". Although the words, always duly capitalized, appear on nearly every page, it turns out that in every instance, with four possible exceptions, they are Fairchild's words and not those of the authors cited.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingson (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Ellingson finds that any remotely positive portrayal of an indigenous (or working class) person is apt to be characterized (out of context) as a supposedly "unrealistic" or "romanticized" "Noble Savage". He points out that Fairchild even includes as an example of a supposed "Noble Savage", a picture of a Negro slave on his knees, lamenting lost his freedom. According to Ellingson, Fairchild ends his book with a denunciation of the (always unnamed) believers in primitivism or "The Noble Savage"—who, he feels, are threatening to unleash the dark forces of irrationality on civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingson (2001), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellingson argues that the term "noble savage", an oxymoron, is a derogatory one, which those who oppose "soft" or romantic primitivism use to discredit (and intimidate) their supposed opponents, whose romantic beliefs they feel are somehow threatening to civilization. Ellingson maintains that virtually none of those accused of believing in the "noble savage" ever actually did so. He likens the practice of accusing anthropologists (and other writers and artists) of belief in the noble savage to a secularized version of the [[inquisition]], and he maintains that modern anthropologists have internalized these accusations to the point where they feel they have to begin by ritualistically disavowing any belief in "noble savage" if they wish to attain credibility in their fields. He notes that text books with a painting of a handsome Native American (such as the one by Benjamin West on this page) are even given to school children with the cautionary caption, "A painting of a Noble Savage". West's depiction is characterized as a typical "noble savage" by art historian Vivien Green Fryd, but her interpretation has been contested.&lt;ref&gt;"British and Indian Identities in a Picture by Benjamin West", Leslie Kaye Reinhardt, ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 31: 3 (Spring 1998): 283–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opponents of primitivism==
The most famous modern example of "hard" (or anti-) primitivism in books and movies was [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', published in 1954. The title is said to be a reference to the Biblical devil, Beelzebub. This book, in which a group of school boys stranded on a desert island "revert" to savage behavior, was a staple of high school and college required reading lists during the Cold War.

In the 1970s, film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] professed his opposition to primitivism. Like Dickens, he began with a disclaimer:

{{quote|Man isn't a noble savage, he's an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved—that about sums it up. I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/013072kubrick-profile.html|last=McGregor|first=Craig|title=Nice Boy From the Bronx?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 30, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The opening scene of Kubrick's movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) depicted prehistoric ape-like men wielding weapons of war, as the tools that supposedly lifted them out of their animal state and made them human.

Another opponent of primitivism is the Australian anthropologist [[Roger Sandall]], who has accused other anthropologists of exalting the "noble savage".&lt;ref&gt;For an appraisal of Roger Sandall, see Patrick Wolfe in'' The Anthropological Book Review'', Sept., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A third is archeologist Lawrence H. Keeley, who has criticised a "widespread myth" that "civilized humans have fallen from grace from a simple primeval happiness, a peaceful golden age" by uncovering archeological evidence that he claims demonstrates that violence prevailed in the earliest human societies. Keeley argues that the "noble savage" paradigm has warped anthropological literature to political ends.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Keeley, ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage'' (Oxford, University Press, 1996), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The noble savage is described as having a natural existence. The term ignoble savage has an obvious negative connotation. The ignoble savage is detested—described as having a cruel and primitive existence. Often, the phrase “ignoble savage” was used and abused to justify colonialism. The concept of the ignoble savage gave Europeans the "right" to establish colonies without considering the possibility of preexisting, functional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ad Borsboom, The Savage In European Social Thought: A Prelude To The Conceptualization Of The Divergent Peoples and Cultures Of Australia and Oceania, KILTV, 1988, 419.&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example would be the use of the [[Discovery Doctrine]] which is still used in the courts of the United States of America.

== In fantasy and science fiction ==
The "noble savage" often maps to uncorrupted races in science fiction and fantasy genres, often deliberately as a contrast to "fallen" more advanced cultures, in films such as ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2009/12/avatar_movie_post.html&lt;/ref&gt; and literature including [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRiViwMylSUC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=%22Ghân-buri-Ghân%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;lr=&amp;ei=B_ygS8S6MoyaMrTdtdQH&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Rutledge, Fleming, ''The Battle for Middle-earth: Tolkien's Divine Design in the Lord of the Rings,''] p. 286, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Two very famous noble savage characters in fantasy and science fiction that are very well known are [[Tarzan]] created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and [[Conan The Barbarian]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]]. [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], [[Thongor]] and such are lesser known. Tarzan and Conan are not only known through their literature, but by movie adaptations and other licensed material.

== Noble savage idea today ==
According to critics like the ''[[Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'''s Tim Robey, romantically idealized portrayals of non-industrialized or exotic people persist in popular films, as for example in ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''&lt;ref name=Robey&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10481755/Tim-Robey-recommends...The-Lone-Ranger.html | title=Tim Robey recommends...The Lone Ranger | publisher=The Telegraph | date=30 November 2013 | accessdate=11 January 2014 | author=Robey, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-jn9p6uuEAC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22 | title=Media Images and Representations | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year=2009 | accessdate=11 January 2014 | author=King, C.

'''Online hate speech''' is a type of speech that takes place online (e.g. the [[Internet]], [[Social media|social media platforms]]) with the purpose to attack a person or a group on the basis of attributes such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[ethnic origin]], [[sexual orientation]], [[disability]], or [[gender]].

Hate speech online is situated at the intersection of multiple tensions: it is the expression of conflicts between different groups within and across societies; it is a vivid example of how technologies with a transformative potential such as the Internet bring with them both opportunities and challenges; and it implies complex balancing between fundamental rights and principles, including [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and the defense of [[Dignity|human dignity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Countering Online Hate Speech|last=Gagliardone|first=Iginio|last2=Gal|first2=Danit|last3=Alves|first3=Thiago|last4=Martinez|first4=Gabriela|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233231e.pdf|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech is a broad and contested term. [[Multilateral treaty|Multilateral treaties]] such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) have sought to define its contours. [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Multi-stakeholders processes]] (e.g. the Rabat Plan of Action) have been initiated to bring greater clarity and suggest mechanisms to identify hateful messages. And yet, hate speech continues largely to be used in everyday discourse as a generic term, mixing concrete threats to individuals' and groups' security with cases in which people may be simply venting their anger against authority. Internet intermediaries—organizations that mediate online communication such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Google]]—have advanced their own definitions of hate speech that bind users to a set of rules and allow companies to limit certain forms of expression. National and regional bodies have sought to promote understandings of the term that are more rooted in local traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Internet]]'s speed and reach makes it difficult for governments to enforce national legislation in the [[virtual world]]. Issues around hate speech online bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function (e.g. Facebook, Twitter), and the challenges that these spaces pose for regulators. Some of the companies owning these spaces have become more responsive towards tackling the problem of hate speech online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The character of hate speech online and its relation to offline speech and action are widely talked about—by [[Politician|politicians]], [[Activism|activists]] and academics—but the debates tend to be removed from systematic empirical evidence. The character of perceived hate speech and its possible consequences has led to placing much emphasis on the solutions to the problem and on how they should be grounded in international human rights norms. Yet this very focus has also limited deeper attempts to understand the causes underlying the phenomenon and the dynamics through which certain types of content emerge, diffuse and lead—or not—to actual [[discrimination]], [[hostility]] or [[violence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

=== Hate speech ===
Hate speech lies in a complex nexus with [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], individual, group and [[minority rights]], as well as concepts of dignity, liberty and equality. Its definition is often contested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In national and international legislation, hate speech refers to expressions that advocate incitement to harm (particularly, discrimination, hostility or [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]) based upon the target's being identified with a certain social or demographic group. It may include, but is not limited to, speech that advocates, threatens, or encourages violent acts. The concept may extend also to expressions that foster a climate of prejudice and intolerance on the assumption that this may fuel targeted [[discrimination]], hostility and violent attacks. At critical times, such as during elections, the concept of hate speech may be prone to [[wikt:manipulation|manipulation]]: accusations of fomenting hate speech may be traded among political opponents or used by those in power to curb [[dissent]] and [[criticism]]. Hate speech (be it conveyed through text, images or sound) can be identified by approximation through the degrading or [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] functions that it serves. There may be two types of messages. The first is to the targeted group and functions to dehumanize and diminish members assigned to this group. It often sounds more or less like:

"Don't be fooled into thinking you are welcome here. [...] You are not wanted, and you and your families will be shunned, excluded, beaten, and driven out, whenever we can get away with it. We may have to keep a low profile right now. But don't get too comfortable. [...] Be afraid."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another function of hate speech is to let others with similar views know they are not alone, to reinforce a sense of an in-group that is (purportedly) under threat. A typical message sent this time to like-minded individuals can read like:

"We know some of you agree that these people are not wanted here. We know that some of you feel that they are dirty (or dangerous or criminal or [[Terrorism|terrorist]]). Know now that you are not alone. [...] There are enough of us around to make sure these people are not welcome. There are enough of us around to draw attention to what these people are really like".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech relies on tensions, which it seeks to re-produce and amplify. Such speech unites and divides at the same time. It creates "us" and "them".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
The proliferation of hate speech online, observed by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues (HRC, 2015), poses a new set of challenges. Both [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and organizations created to combat hate speech have recognized that hateful messages [[Dissemination|disseminated]] online are increasingly common and have elicited unprecedented attention to develop adequate responses.&lt;ref&gt;See Council of Europe, "Mapping study on projects against hate speech online", 15 April 2012. See also interviews: Christine Chen, Senior Manager for Public Policy, Google, 2 March 2015; Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management, Facebook, 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hatebase|HateBase]], a web-based application that collects instances of hate speech online worldwide, the majority of cases of hate speech target individuals based on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] and [[nationality]], but incitements to hatred focusing on [[religion]] and class have also been on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;See HateBase, Hate speech statistics, http://www.hatebase.org/popular&lt;/ref&gt;

While hate speech online is not intrinsically different from similar expressions found offline, there are peculiar challenges unique to online content and its regulation. Those challenges related to its permanence, itinerancy, [[Human rights and encryption|anonymity]] and cross-jurisdictional character are among the most complex to address.

Hate speech can stay online for a long time in different formats across multiple platforms, which can be linked repeatedly. As Andre Oboler, the CEO of the Online Hate Prevention Institute, has noted, "The longer the content stays available, the more damage it can inflict on the victims and empower the perpetrators. If you remove the content at an early stage you can limit the exposure. This is just like cleaning litter, it doesn't stop people from littering but if you do not take care of the problem it just piles up and further exacerbates."&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Andre Oboler, CEO, Online Hate Prevention Institute, 31 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]]'s conversations organized around trending topics may facilitate the quick and wide spreading of hateful messages, but they also offer the opportunity for influential speakers to shun messages and possibly end popular threads [[Online youth radicalization|inciting violence]]. [[Facebook]], on the contrary, may allow multiple threads to continue in parallel and go unnoticed; creating longer lasting spaces where certain individuals and groups are offended, ridiculed and discriminated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hate speech online can be itinerant. Even when content is removed, it may find expression elsewhere, possibly on the same platform under a different name or on different online spaces. If a [[website]] is shut down, it can quickly reopen using a [[Web hosting service|web-hosting service]] with less stringent [[Regulation|regulations]] or via the reallocation to a country with laws imposing higher threshold for hate speech. The itinerant nature of hate speech also means that poorly formulated thoughts that would have not found public expression and support in the past may now land on spaces where they can be visible to large audiences.&lt;ref&gt;There are cases of individuals who had to serve jail sentences for tweets written when drunk or for having jokingly tweeted they were planning to blowing up an airport (Rowbottom 2012).{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anonymity]] can also present a challenge to dealing with hate speech online. "(T)he internet facilitates anonymous and pseudonymous discourse, which can just as easily accelerate destructive behavior as it can fuel public discourse"&lt;ref&gt;Citron &amp; Norton 2011{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As Drew Boyd, Director of Operations at The [[Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention|Sentinel Project]], has stated, "the Internet grants individuals the ability to say horrific things because they think they will not be discovered. This is what makes online hate speech so unique, because people feel much more comfortable speaking hate as opposed to real life when they have to deal with the consequences of what they say".&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Drew Boyd, Director of Operations, The Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention, 24 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments and [[social media]] platforms have sought to enforce real name [[Policy|policies]]. Such measures have been deeply contested as they hit at the [[right to privacy]] and its intersection with free expression. The majority of [[Internet troll|online trolling]] and hate speech attacks come from [[Pseudonym|pseudonymous]] accounts, which are not necessarily anonymous to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Ian Brown, University of Oxford, 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Genuinely anonymous online communications are rare, as they require the user to employ highly technical measures to ensure that he or she cannot be easily identifiable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A further complication is the [[Transnationalism|transnational]] reach of the Internet, raising issues of cross jurisdictional co-operation in regard to legal mechanisms for combating hate speech. While there are [[Mutual legal assistance treaty|Mutual Legal Assistance treaties]] in place amongst many countries, these are characteristically slow to work. The transnational reach of many [[Private sector|private-sector]] [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Internet intermediaries]] may provide a more effective channel for resolving issues in some cases, although these bodies are also often impacted upon by cross-jurisdictional appeals for data (such as revealing the identity of the author of a particular content).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the dissemination of hate speech through conventional channels, hate speech dissemination online often involves multiple actors, whether knowingly or not. When perpetrators makes use of an online social platform to disseminate their hateful message they do not only hurt their victims, but may also violate terms of service in that platform and at times even state law, depending on their location. The victims, on their part, may feel helpless in the face of online harassment, not knowing to whom they should turn to for help. In the types of responses mapped throughout the study, it appears that collective action, usually undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] and [[Advocacy group|lobby groups]], has been an effective [[modus operandi]] to raise awareness and encourage different stakeholders to take action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Stormfront'' precedent ===
In the aftermath of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|2014]]'s [[Islamic terrorism|dramatic incidents]], calls for more restrictive or intrusive measures to contain the Internet's potential to spread hate and violence are common, as if the links between [[Online youth radicalization|online and offline violence]] were well known. On the contrary, as the following example indicates, appearances may often be deceiving. [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] is considered the first "hate website"&lt;ref&gt;Meddaugh and Kay, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Launched in March 1995 by a former [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan leader]], it quickly became a popular space for discussing ideas related to [[Neo-Nazism]], [[White nationalism]] and [[White separatism]], first in the [[United States|United States of America]] and then globally&lt;ref&gt;Bowman-Grieve, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The forum hosts calls for a racial holy war and incitement to use violence to resist [[immigration]]&lt;ref&gt;Bowman-Grieve, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a space for recruiting [[Activism|activists]] and possibly coordinating violent acts&lt;ref&gt;Chang et al. 2014{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The few studies that have explored who the users of Stormfront actually are depict a more complex picture. Rather than seeing it as a space for coordinating actions, well-known extreme right activists have accused the forum to be just a gathering for "[[Keyboard man|keyboard warriors]]". One of them for example, as reported by De Koster and Houtman, stated, "I have read quite a few pieces around the forum, and it strikes me that a great fuss is made, whereas little happens. The section activism/politics itself is plainly ridiculous. [...] Not to mention the assemblies where just four people turn up"&lt;ref&gt;De Koster and Houtman, 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even more revealing are some of the responses to these accusations provided by regular members of the website. As one of them argued, "Surely, I am entitled to have an opinion without actively carrying it out. [...] I do not attend demonstrations and I neither join a political party. If this makes me a keyboard warrior, that is all right. I feel good this way. [...] I am not ashamed of it"&lt;ref&gt;De Koster and Houtman, 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. De Koster and Houtman surveyed only one national chapter of Stormfront and a non-representative sample of users, but answers like those above should at least invite to caution towards hypotheses connecting expressions and actions, even in spaces whose main function is to host extremist views.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Frameworks ==

=== International principles ===
Hate speech is not explicitly mentioned in many [[International human rights law|international human rights]] documents and [[Treaty|treaties]], but it is indirectly called upon by some of the principles related to human dignity and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]. For example, the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which was drafted as a response to the atrocities of the [[World War II]], contains the right to equal protection under the law in Article 7, which proclaims that: "All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Art 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The UDHR also states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes "freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Art 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDHR was decisive in setting a framework and agenda for human rights protection, but the Declaration is [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]]. A series of binding documents have been subsequently created to offer a more robust protection for freedom of expression and protection against discrimination. Out of those documents, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) is the most important and comprehensive when addressing hate speech and contains the right to freedom of expression in Article 19 and the prohibition of advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence in Article 20. Other more tailored international legal instruments contain provisions that have repercussions for the definition of hate speech and identification of responses to it, such as: the [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (1951), the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], ICERD (1969), and, to a lesser extent, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], CEDAW (1981).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hate speech and the ICCPR ===
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] is the legal instrument most commonly referred to in debates on hate speech and its regulation, although it does not explicitly use the term "hate speech". Article 19, which is often referred to as part of the "core of the Covenant"&lt;ref&gt;Nowak 1993{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, provides for the right to freedom of expression. This sets out the right, and it also includes general strictures to which any limitation of the right must conform in order to be legitimate. Article 19 is followed by Article 20 that expressly limits freedom of expression in cases of "advocacy of national, [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious hatred]] that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence"&lt;ref&gt;Leo et al. 2011{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The decision to include this provision, which can be characterised as embodying a particular conceptualisation of hate speech, has been deeply contested. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]], the [[United Nations]] body created by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] to oversee its implementation, cognizant of the tension, has sought to stress that Article 20 is fully compatible with the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 11, Article 20: Prohibition of Propaganda for War and Inciting National, Racial or Religious Hatred, 29 July 1983, para. 2. In 2011, The Committee elucidated its views on the relationship of Article 19 and 20 when it reaffirmed that the provisions complement each other and that Article 20 "may be considered as lex specialis with regard to Article 19". Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 34, Article 19: Freedoms of opinion and expression, CCPR/C/GC/34, 12 September 2011, paras. 48-52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It can legitimately be limited by states under restricted circumstances:

"3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order ([[Public policy doctrine|ordre public]]), or of [[public health]] or [[Morality|morals]]."&lt;ref&gt;Article 19 (3) if the ICCPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Article 19 (3) and Article 20, there is a distinction between optional and obligatory limitations to the right to freedom of expression. Article 19 (3) states that limitations on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] "may therefore be subject to certain restrictions", as long as they are provided by law and necessary to certain legitimate purposes. Article 20 states that any advocacy of (certain kinds of) hatred that constitutes incitement to [[discrimination]], [[hostility]] or violence "shall be prohibited by law". Despite indications on the gravity of speech offenses that should be prohibited by law under Article 20, there remains complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Even the Human Rights Committee, which has decided on cases concerning Article 20, has avoided providing a definition of incitement to hatred. Human Rights Council. Incitement to Racial and Religious Hatred and the Promotion of Tolerance: Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, 20 September 2006, para. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular there is a grey area in conceptualising clear distinctions between (i) expressions of hatred, (ii) expression that advocate hatred, and (iii) hateful speech that specifically constitutes incitement to the practical harms of discrimination, hostility or violence. While states have an obligation to prohibit speech conceived as "advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence", as consistent with Article 20 (2),&lt;ref&gt;Faurisson v. France , C. Individual opinion by Elizabeth Evatt and David Kretzmer, co-signed by Eckart Klein (concurring), para. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; how to interpret such is not clearly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Council. Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Addendum, Expert seminar on the links between articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, A/HRC/10/31/Add.3, 16 January 2009, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other international legal instruments ===

==== ICERD ====
The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD), which came into force in 1969, has also implications for conceptualising forms of hate speech. The ICERD differs from the ICCPR in three respects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its conceptualisation of hate speech is specifically limited to speech that refers to race and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. It asserts in Article 4, paragraph (a), that state parties:

"Shall declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another color or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; This obligation imposed by the ICERD on state parties is also stricter than the case of Article 20 of the ICCPR covering the criminalisation of racist ideas that are not necessarily inciting discrimination, hostility or violence."

An important difference is in the issue of [[Intention|intent]]. The concept of "advocacy of hatred" introduced in the ICCPR is more specific than discriminatory speech described in the ICERD, since it is taken to require consideration of the intent of author and not the expression in [[Isolationism|isolation]]—this is because "advocacy" is interpreted in the ICCPR as requiring the intent to sow hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, para. 39;&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has actively addressed hate speech in its General Recommendation 29, in which the Committee recommends state parties to:

"(r) Take measures against any dissemination of ideas of caste superiority and inferiority or which attempt to justify violence, hatred or discrimination against descent-based communities; (s) Take strict measures against any incitement to discrimination or violence against the communities, including through the Internet; (t) Take measures to raise awareness among media professionals of the nature and incidence of descent-based discrimination;"&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, General Recommendation 29, Discrimination Based on Descent (Sixty-first session, 2002), U.N. Doc. A/57/18 at 111 (2002), reprinted in Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, U.N.Doc. HRI\GEN\1\Rev.6 at 223 (2003), paras. r, s and t&lt;/ref&gt;

These points, which reflect the ICERD's reference to the dissemination of expression, have significance for the [[Internet]]. The expression of ideas in some online contexts may immediately amount to spreading them. This is especially relevant for private spaces that have begun to play a public role, as in the case of many [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Genocide Convention ====
Similarly to the ICERD, the [[Genocide Convention]] aims to protect groups defined by race, nationality or ethnicity, although it also extends its provisions to religious groups. When it comes to hate speech the Genocide Convention is limited only to acts that publicly incite to [[genocide]], recognized as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group", regardless of whether such acts are undertaken in peacetime or in wartime&lt;ref&gt;Defeis 1992{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically [[Gender violence|gender-based]] hate speech (as distinct from discriminatory actions) is not covered in depth in [[international law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== CEDAW ====
The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which entered into force in 1981, imposes obligations on states to condemn discrimination against women&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the CEDAW.&lt;/ref&gt; and "prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish" acts of gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;General recommendation No. 28 on the core obligations of States parties under article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional responses ===
Most [[Regional organization|regional instruments]] do not have specific articles prescribing [[prohibition]] of hate speech, but they more generally allow states to limit freedom of expression—which provisions can be applied to specific cases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== American Convention on Human Rights ====
The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] describes limitations on freedom of expression in a manner similar to the ICCPR in Article 19 (3). The [[Organization of American States]] has also adopted another declaration on the principles of freedom of expression, which includes a specific clause stating that "prior conditioning of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or [[impartiality]] is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression recognized in international instruments".&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression, 20 October 2000, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-American Court has advised that "(a)buse of freedom of information thus cannot be controlled by [[Risk|preventive measures]] but only through the subsequent imposition of sanctions on those who are guilty of the abuses".&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also imposes a test for States willing to enact restrictions on freedom of expression, as they need to observe the following requirements: "a) the existence of previously established grounds for liability; b) the express and precise definition of these grounds by law; c) the legitimacy of the ends sought to be achieved; d) a showing that these grounds of liability are ‘necessary to ensure' the aforementioned ends."&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-American System has a [[Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression|Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression]] who conducted a comprehensive study on hate speech. His conclusion was that the Inter-American Human Rights System differs from the United Nations and the [[European Union|European]] approach on a key point: The Inter-American system covers only hate speech that actually leads to violence, and solely such speech can be restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights ====
The [[African Union|African]] Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights takes a different approach in Article 9 (2), allowing for restrictions on rights as long as they are "within the law". This concept has been criticized and there is a vast amount of legal scholarship on the so-called "claw-back" clauses and their interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Viljoen 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The criticism is mainly aimed at the fact that countries can manipulate their own legislation and weaken the essence of the right to freedom of expression. The Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa elaborates a higher standard for limitations on freedom of expression. It declares that the right "should not be restricted on public order or national security grounds unless there is a real risk of harm to a legitimate interest and there is a close causal link between the risk of harm and the expression".&lt;ref&gt;African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, 32nd Session, Banjul, 17 - 23 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam ====
In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of the Islamic Conference]] (which was later renamed Organization of Islamic Cooperation, OIC) adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] (CDHRI), which calls for criminalisation of speech that extends beyond cases of imminent violence to encompass "acts or speech that denote manifest intolerance and hate".&lt;ref&gt;Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Sixth OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia, Presented to the 40th Council of Foreign Ministers, Conakry, Republic of Guinea, December 2013, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arab Charter on Human Rights ====
The Arab Charter on Human Rights, which was adopted by the [[Council of the Arab League|Council]] of the [[Arab League|League of Arab States]] in 2004, includes in Article 32 provisions that are relevant also for online communication as it guarantees the right to "freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any medium, regardless of geographical boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May, 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; It allows a limitation on a broad basis in paragraph 2 "Such rights and freedoms shall be exercised in conformity with the fundamental values of society".&lt;ref&gt;League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May, 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ASEAN Human Rights Declaration ====
The [[ASEAN Human Rights Declaration]] includes the right to freedom of expression in Article 23. Article 7 of the Declaration provides for general limitations, affirming, "the realisation of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context bearing in mind different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious backgrounds."&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ====
The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] which declares the right to freedom of expression in Article 11, has a clause which prohibits abuse of rights. It asserts that the Charter must not be interpreted as implying any "limitation to a greater extent than is provided for therein".&lt;ref&gt;Article 54 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a limitation which implies a strict test of necessity and proportionality is the provision on freedom of expression in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which underlines that the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities. It "may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a [[Democracy|democratic]] society, in the interests of [[national security]], [[territorial integrity]] or [[Public security|public safety]], for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] is careful to distinguish between hate speech and the right of individuals to express their views freely, even if others take offence.&lt;ref&gt;Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, para. 49. More cases of hate Speech under the European Court can be found at: http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf 49&lt;/ref&gt; There are regional instances relevant specifically to online hate speech. The [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) in 2000 issued a General Policy Recommendation on Combating the Dissemination of Racist, [[Xenophobia|Xenophobic]] and [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitic]] Material via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;ECRI General Policy Recommendation No. 6, On Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Antisemitic Material via the Internet, adopted on 15 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the CoE Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, which regulates mutual assistance regarding investigative powers, provides signatory countries with a mechanism to deal with [[Data (computing)|computer data]], which would include [[Transnationalism|transnational]] hate speech online.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, paras 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the CoE launched an additional protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime which addresses online expression of racism and xenophobia. The convention and its protocol were opened for signature and ratification of countries outside [[Europe]], and other countries, such as [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]], are already part of this convention. The Protocol imposes an obligation on Member States to criminalise racist and xenophobic insults online of "(i) persons for the reason that they belong to a group distinguished by race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, 28 January 2003, art 5 para 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private spaces ===
[[Internet]] intermediaries such as [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]], [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] or [[Web search engine|Search Engines]], stipulate in their [[terms of service]] how they may intervene in allowing, restricting, or channelling the creation and access to specific content. A vast amount of online interactions occur on social networking platforms that transcend national jurisdictions and which platforms have also developed their own definitions of hate speech and measures to respond to it. For a user who violates the terms of service, the content he or she has posted may be removed from the platform, or its access may be restricted to be viewed only by a certain category of users (e.g. users living outside a specific country).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The principles that inspire terms of service agreements and the mechanisms that each company develops to ensure their [[implementation]] have significant repercussions on the ability that people have to express themselves online as well as to be protected from hate speech. Most intermediaries have to enter in negotiations with national governments to an extent that varies according to the type of intermediary, areas where the company is registered, and the legal regime that applies. As Tsesis explains, "(i)f transmissions on the Internet are sent and received in particular locations, then specific fora retain jurisdiction to prosecute illegal activities transacted on the Internet"&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, 2001{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Internet Service Providers are the most directly affected by national legislation because they have to be located in a specific country to operate. Search Engines, while they can modify search results for self-regulatory or commercial reasons, have increasingly tended to adapt to the intermediary liability regime of both their registered home jurisdictions and other jurisdictions in which they provide their services, either removing links to content proactively or upon request by authorities&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon et al. 2015{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

All Internet intermediaries operated by [[Privately held company|private companies]] are also expected to respect [[human rights]]. This is set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights elaborated by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. The document emphasizes [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate responsibility]] in upholding human rights. In principle 11, it declares that: "Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Guiding Principles also indicate that in cases in which human rights are violated, companies should "provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Internet intermediaries and conceptions of hate speech, this means that they should ensure that measures are in place to provide a commensurate response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social responses ==

=== Civil society ===
[[Myanmar]] is transitioning towards greater openness and access to the Internet has grown at unprecedented rates. In this context, however, social media have often been used by some to spread calls to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hereward Holland, "Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?," Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hatespeech-2014612112834290144.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues expressed her concern over the spread of [[misinformation]], hate speech and [[Hate speech|incitement to violence]], discrimination and hostility in the media and Internet, particularly targeted against a minority community&lt;ref&gt;HRC, 2015{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The growing tension online has gone parallel with cases of actual violence leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788&lt;/ref&gt; One challenge in this process has concerned ethnic and religious minorities. In 2013, 43 people were killed due to clashes that erupted after a dispute in the [[Rakhine State|Rakhine state]] in the Western Part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier, more than 200 people were killed and thousands displaced 37 because of ethnic violence, which erupted after an alleged rape case.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marshall, "Special Report: Plight of Muslim Minority Threatens Myanmar Spring," Reuters, 15 June 2012, https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/us-myanmar-rohingya-idUSBRE85E06A20120615&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop, the rapid emergence of new online spaces, albeit for a fraction of the population, has reflected some of these deeply rooted tensions in a new form. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dealing with intolerance and hate speech online is an emerging issue. Facebook has rapidly become the platform of choice for those citizens making their first steps online. In this environment there have been individual and groups, which have championed a more aggressive use of the medium, especially when feeling protected by a sense of righteousness and by claims to be acting in defense of the [[national interest]]. Political figures have also used online media for particular causes. In social media, there has been the use of derogatory terms in reference to minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Kinetz, "New Numerology of Hate Grows in Burma", Irrawaddy, 29 April 2013 http://www.irrawaddy.org/religion/new-numerology-of-hate-grows-in-burma.html. Hereward Holland, "Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?," Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014; Steven Kiersons, "The Colonial Origins of Hate Speech in Burma", The Sentinel Project, 28 October 2013, https://thesentinelproject.org/2013/10/28/the-colonial-origins-of-hate-speech-in-burma/ ., http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hate-speech-2014612112834290144.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this complex situation, a variety of actors has begun to mobilize, seeking to offer responses that can avoid further violence. Facebook has sought to take a more active role in monitoring the uses of the social network platform in Myanmar, developing [[Partnership|partnerships]] with local organizations and making guidelines on reporting problems accessible in Burmese.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McLaughlin, "Facebook takes steps to combat hate speech", The Myanmar Times, 25 July 2014. http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11114-facebook-standards-marked-for-translation.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The local civil society has constituted a strong voice in openly condemning the spread of online hate speech, but at the same time calling for alternatives to [[censorship]]. Among the most innovative responses has been Panzagar, which in Burmese means "flower speech", a campaign launched by blogger and activist [[Nay Phone Latt]] to openly oppose hate speech. The goal of the initiative was offering a joyful example of how people can interact, both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;San Yamin Aung, "Burmese Online Activist Discusses Campaign Against Hate Speech", Irrawaddy, http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html&lt;/ref&gt; Local activists have been focussed upon local solutions, rather than trying to mobilize [[Civil society|global civil society]] on these issues. This is in contrast to some other online campaigns that have been able to attract the world's attention towards relatively neglected problems. Initiatives such as those promoted by the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] for the [[War in Darfur|civil war in Sudan]], or the organization [[Invisible Children]] with the [[Kony 2012|Kony2012]] campaign that denounced the atrocities committed by the [[Lord's Resistance Army|Lord Resistance Army]], are popular examples. As commentaries on these campaigns have pointed out, such global responses may have negative repercussions on the ability for local solutions to be found&lt;ref&gt;Schomerus, 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Private companies ===
Internet intermediaries have developed disparate definitions of hate speech and guidelines to regulate it. Some companies do not use the term hate speech, but have a descriptive list of terms related to it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Yahoo! ====
[[Yahoo!]]'s terms of service prohibit the posting of "content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, [[Harassment|harassing]], tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, [[Defamation|libellous]], invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable".&lt;ref&gt;http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/smallbusiness/bizmail/spam/spam-44.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Twitter ====
In December of 2017, [[Twitter]] began enforcing new policies towards hate speech, banning multiple accounts as well as setting new guidelines for what will be allowed on their platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16789606/twitter-new-safety-policies-hate-groups|title=Twitter starts enforcing new policies on violence, abuse, and hateful conduct|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire page in the Twitter Help Center devoted to describing their Hateful Conduct Policy, as well as their enforcement procedures. The top of this page states “Freedom of expression means little if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. We do not tolerate behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another person’s voice. If you see something on Twitter that violates these rules, please report it to us.” Twitter’s definition of [[hate speech]] ranges from “violent threats” and “wishes for the physical harm, death, or disease of individuals or groups” to “repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone.”

Punishments for violations range from suspending a user’s ability to tweet until they take down their offensive/ hateful post to the removal of an account entirely. In a statement following the implementation of their new policies, Twitter said “In our efforts to be more aggressive here, we may make some mistakes and are working on a robust appeals process” . . . “We’ll evaluate and iterate on these changes in the coming days and weeks, and will keep you posted on progress along the way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy|title=Hateful conduct policy|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes come amidst a time where action is being taken to prevent hate speech around the globe, including new laws in Europe which pose fines for sites unable to address [[hate speech]] reports within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42510868|title=Germany to enforce hate speech law|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== YouTube ====
[[YouTube]], a subsidiary of the tech company [[Google]], has outlined a clear “Hate Speech Policy” amidst several other user policies on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803176|title=Hate speech policy - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is worded as such: “We encourage free speech and try to defend your right to express unpopular points of view, but we don't permit hate speech. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes, such as: race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation/gender identity”. YouTube has built in a user reporting system in order to counteract the growing trend of hate speech. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027|title=Report inappropriate content - Android - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular deterrents against hate speech, users are able to anonymously report another user for content they deem inappropriate. The content is then reviewed against YouTube policy and age restrictions, and either taken down or left alone.

==== Facebook ====
[[Facebook]]'s terms forbid content that is harmful, threatening or which has potential to stir hatred and incite violence. In its community standards, Facebook elaborates that "Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious [[Disability|disabilities]] or [[Disease|diseases]]". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&lt;/ref&gt; It further states that "We allow humour, [[satire]] or social commentary related to these topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, they are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Facebook’s hate speech policies are enforced by 7,500 content reviewers. Because this requires difficult decision making, controversy arises among content reviewers over enforcement of policies. Some users seem to feel as though the enforcement is inconsistent. One apt past example is two separate but similarly graphic postings that wished death to members of a specific religion. Both post were flagged by users and reviewed by Facebook staff. However only one was removed even though they carried almost identical sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes|title=Facebook's Uneven Enforcement of Hate Speech Rules Allows Vile Posts to Stay Up|last=Tobin|first=Ariana|date=|work=Propublica|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a quote regarding hate speech on the platform, Facebook Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofky stated, “We’re sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build…We must do better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes|title=Facebook’s Uneven Enforcement of Hate Speech Rules Allows Vile Posts to Stay Up|last=Tobin|first=Ariana|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
There has been additional controversy due to the specificity of Facebook's [[hate speech]]  policies. On many occasions there have been reports of status updates and comments that users feel are insensitive and convey hatred. However these posts do not technically breach any Facebook policies because their speech does not attack others based on the company's list of protected classes.   For example, the statement “Female sports reporters need to be hit in the head with hockey pucks," would not be considered hate speech on Facebook’s platform and therefore would not be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/13/technology/facebook-hate-speech-quiz.html|title=What Does Facebook Consider Hate Speech? Take Our Quiz|last=Carlsen|first=Audrey|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company protects against gender based hatred, it does not protect against hatred based on occupation.
 
Facebook also tries to accommodate users who promote other hate speech content with the intent of criticizing it. In these cases, users are required make it clear that their intention is to educate others. If this intention is unclear then Facebook reserves the right to censor the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/|title=Community Standards: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Facebook initially flags content that may contain hate speech, they then designate it to a Tier 1, 2, and 3 scale, based on the content’s severity. Tier 1 is the most severe and Tier 3 is the least. Tier 1 includes anything that conveys “violent speech or support for death/disease/harm.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2018/04/24/facebook-community-standards-content-policy-nudity-sexual-content-hate-speech/|title=This is what Facebook won’t let you post|last=Mills|first=Chris|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tier 2 is classified as content that slanders another user's image mentally, physically, or morally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech/|title=Community Guidelines: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tier 3 includes anything that can potentially exclude or discriminate against others, or that uses slurs about protected groups, but does not necessarily apply to arguments to restrict immigration or criticism of existing immigration policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech/|title=Community Guidelines: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microsoft ====
[[Microsoft]] has specific rules concerning hate speech for a variety of its [[Application software|applications]]. Its [[policy]] for mobile phones prohibits applications that "contain any content that advocates discrimination, hatred, or violence based on considerations of race, ethnicity, national origin, language, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, status as a veteran, or membership in any other social group."&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh184842(v=vs.105).aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also rules regarding online gaming, which prohibit any communication that is indicative of "hate speech, controversial religious topics and sensitive current or historical events".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/legal/codeofconduct&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media and information literacy ===
{{Main|Media literacy}}

[[Media Literacy|Media and Information Literacy]] aims to help people to engage in a [[Information society|digital society]] by being able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically; while being able to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-and-information-literacy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citizenship]] education focuses on preparing individuals to be informed and responsible citizens through the study of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities and has been variously employed in societies emerging from violent conflict&lt;ref&gt;Osler and Starksey, 2005{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of its main objectives is raising awareness on the political, social and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including [[freedom of speech]] and the responsibilities and social implications that emerge from it. The concern of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] with hate speech is twofold: it encompasses the knowledge and skills to identify hate speech, and should enable individuals to counteract messages of hatred. One of its current challenges is adapting its goals and strategies to the digital world, providing not only [[argumentative]] but also [[Technology|technological]] knowledge and skills that a citizen may need to counteract online hate speech. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Information literacy]] cannot avoid issues such as rights to free expression and privacy, critical citizenship and fostering [[empowerment]] for [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]]&lt;ref&gt;Mossberger et al. 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Multiple and complementary literacies become critical. The emergence of new technologies and social media has played an important role in this shift. Individuals have evolved from being only [[Consumer|consumers]] of media messages to producers, creators and curator of information, resulting in new models of participation that interact with traditional ones, like [[voting]] or joining a [[political party]]. Teaching strategies are changing accordingly, from fostering critical reception of media messages to include empowering the creation of media content&lt;ref&gt;Hoechsmann and Poyntz, 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of media and information literacy itself continues to evolve, being augmented by the dynamics of the Internet. It is beginning to embrace issues of [[Identity politics|identity]], ethics and rights in [[cyberspace]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paris Declaration: Paris Declaration on MIL in the Digital Era. http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-andinformation/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/2014/paris-declaration-on-mediaand-information-literacy-adopted/&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these skills can be particularly important when identifying and responding to hate speech online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">'''Open individualism''' is the view in the philosophy of personal identity, according to which there exists only one [[Identity (philosophy)|numerically identical]] subject, which is everyone at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theoretical solution for the question of [[personal identity]], being contrasted with empty individualism, the view that personal identities correspond to a fixed pattern that instantaneously disappears with the passage of time, and with closed individualism, the common view that personal identities are particular to subjects and yet survive time.

The term was coined by philosopher [[Daniel Kolak]], though this view has been described at least since the time of the [[Upanishads]], in the late [[Bronze Age]]. Its sentence "[[Tat tvam asi]]," meaning "You are that," is an example. Notable people having expressed similar views (in various forms) include the [[Sufism|Sufi]] thinker Aziz al-Nasafi, [[Averroes]], German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Indian mystic [[Meher Baba]], [[Alan Watts]], as well as renowned physicists [[Erwin Schrödinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf |title=What is life? |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |orig-year=First published 1944 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113143420/http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf |archive-date=November 13, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeman Dyson]], and [[Fred Hoyle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10235">'''Post-conceptual''', '''Postconceptual''', '''Post-conceptualism''' or '''Postconceptualism''' is an [[art theory]] that builds upon the legacy of [[conceptual art]] in [[contemporary art]], where the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work takes some precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into art school parlance through the influence of [[John Baldessari]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the early 1970s. The writer eldritch Priest, specifically ties John Baldessari's piece ''Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries)'' from 1973 (in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the best out of 36 tries, with 36 being the determining number as that is the standard number of shots on a roll of [[35mm film]]) as an early example of post-conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;eldritch Priest, ''Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure'', Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often connected to [[generative art]] and [[digital art]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 125-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-conceptualism as an art practice has also been connected to the work of [[Robert C. Morgan]], specifically his ''Turkish Bath'' installation at [[Artists Space]] in 1976, and in Morgan's writing in ''Between Modernism and Conceptual Art: A Critical Response '' from 1997. It has been connected to the work of [[Robert Smithson]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 99-116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piero Manzoni]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred Mohr]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/3908524 "Interview with Joseph Nechvatal, post-conceptual digital artist, composer and art theoretician"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lygia Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ascott]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Annette Lemieux]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Matt Mullican]], and  the [[intermedia]] concept employed in the mid-sixties by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==As specific condition==
Conceptual Art focused attention on the idea behind the art object and questioned the traditional role of that object as the conveyor of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Subsequently, those theories cast doubt upon the necessity of materiality itself as conceptual artists "de-materialized" the art object and began to produce time-based and [[ephemeral]] artworks. Although total [[dematerialization (art)|dematerialization of the art object]] never occurred, the [[art object]] became flexible – [[malleable]] – and that malleability, coupled with [[semiotics]] and [[computer process]]ing, has resulted in the '''post-conceptual art object'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticpropaganda.co.uk/catalogues/Plastic_Propaganda_Post_Conceptual_Art_Practice_Part_Two.pdf] Post-Conceptual Art Practice: New Directions&lt;/ref&gt;

==As general condition==
Conceptual Art at the end of the 20th Century spread to become a general tendency, a resonance within art practice that became nearly ubiquitous. Thus the widespread use of the term “post-conceptual” as a prefix to painting such as that of [[Gerhard Richter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://oro.open.ac.uk/21890/] Gaiger, Jason (2004). Post conceptual painting: Gerhard Richter's Extended Leave-taking in themes in contemporary art. In: Perry, Gillian and Wood, Paul eds. Themes in Contemporary Art. London: Yale University Press, pp. 89–135&lt;/ref&gt; and photography such as that of [[Andreas Gursky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/one-and-three-ideas-conceptualism-before-during-and-after-conceptual-art/|title=One and Three Ideas: Conceptualism Before, During, and After Conceptual Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh|Benjamin Buchloh]] in ''Art After Conceptual Art'' points out that post-conceptual art is already emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the photo-based [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation art]] of [[Martha Rosler]], [[Louise Lawler]],  [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Dara Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] makes the point that "post-conceptual art is not the name for a particular type of art so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general...."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne first noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

'''Precision bias''' is a form of [[cognitive bias]] in which an evaluator of information commits a logical [[fallacy]] as the result of confusing [[accuracy and precision]]. More particularly, in assessing the merits of an argument, a measurement, or a report, an observer or assessor falls prey to precision bias when he or she believes that greater precision implies greater accuracy (i.e., that simply because a statement is precise, it is also true); the observer or assessor are said to provide [[false precision]].

Precision bias, whether called by that phrase or another, is addressed in fields such as economics, in which there is a significant danger that a seemingly impressive quantity of statistics may be collected even though these statistics may be of little value for demonstrating any particular truth.

It is also called the numeracy bias, or the range estimate aversion.

The [[clustering illusion]] and the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]] may both be treated as relatives of precision bias. In these former fallacies, precision is mistakenly considered evidence of causation, when in fact the clustered information may actually be the result of [[randomness]].

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy and taxpayer funded arrangements initially applied to Muslim Indian pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Since 1973, pilgrims applying through the [[Haj Committee of India]] are offered a concessionary fare on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;Press Information Bureau, [http://www.indianmuslims.info/book/export/html/14454 "Hajj operation in India 2006"], December 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14289">'''Regenerative design''' is a process-oriented [[Systems theory|whole systems]] approach to [[Design thinking|design]]. The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] and equitable systems that integrate the needs of [[society]] with the integrity of nature. 

Designers use [[Systems theory|systems thinking]], applied [[Permaculture|permaculture design]] principles, and [[community development]] processes to design human and [[ecological]] systems. The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the [[biomimicry]], [[biophilic design]], [[Ecological economics|ecological economics,]] [[Circular economy|circular economics]]. As well as [[Social movement|social movements]] such as permaculture, [[Transition town|transition]] and the [[new economy]]. Regenerative design can also refer to process of designing systems such as [[restorative justice]], [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] and [[regenerative agriculture]].
[[File:Feedback loop.png|thumb|Feedback loop used in regenerative design]]
A new generation of designers are applying ecologically inspired design to [[agriculture]], architecture, [[community planning]], [[Sustainable urban planning|cities]], [[wikt:enterprise|enterprise]]s, [[economics]] and [[Systems ecology|ecosystem regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/designing-regenerative-cultures|title=Permaculture magazine|date=2016-06-18|work=Permaculture magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers use the resilient models observed in [[systems ecology]] in their design process and recognize that [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] are [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] largely because they operate in [[closed ecological system|closed loop systems.]] Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process. [[Feedback]] loops are an integral to regenerative systems as understood by processes used in [[Restorative practices|restorative practice]] and [[community development]].

Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with [[New Economy Coalition#New Economy movement|New Economy movement]]. The 'new economy' considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebold|first=William|last2=Alperovitz|first2=Gar|last3=Faux|first3=Jeff|date=1984|title=Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for the New Economy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/20042109|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=63|issue=1|pages=190|doi=10.2307/20042109|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. 

Whereas the highest aim of [[sustainable development]] is to satisfy [[fundamental human needs]] today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs, the goal of regenerative design is to develop restorative systems that are dynamic and emergent, and are beneficial for humans and other species. This regeneration process is participatory, iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to. This process intends to revitalize communities, human and natural resources, and for some, society as a whole. 

In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio- technicle platforms and technological systems as used in [[Smart city|SMART cities]]. It is an includes community and city development processes like gathering [[feedback]], [[Participatory democracy|participatory governance]], [[sortition]] and [[participatory budgeting]].

== History ==
During the late 1970s, [[John T. Lyle]] (1934–1998), a [[landscape architecture]] professor, challenged graduate students to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available [[Renewable resource|renewable resources]] without [[environmental degradation]]. Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students, professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. In 1992 the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] was built over two years and opened in 1994. In that same year Lyle's book ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]. In 1995 Lyle worked with [[William McDonough]] at [[Oberlin College]] for the [[Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies]] completed in 2000. In 2002 McDonough's book, the more popular and successful, ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle.

Lyle saw the connection between concepts developed by [[Robert Rodale|Bob Rodale]] of the [[Rodale Institute]] for [[regenerative agriculture]] and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. With regenerative agriculture, the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as [[entropy]] and [[embodied energy|emergy]] must be taken into consideration.

Swiss architect [[Walter R. Stahel]] developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle's also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term [[cradle-to-cradle design]] made popular by McDonough and [[Michael Braungart]]

Whilst in 1974 [[David Holmgren]] and [[Bill Mollison]] first started working together to develop the theory and practice of [[permaculture]]. They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together. During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas, and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become ''Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements'' as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargavel|first=John|last2=Mulligan|first2=Martin|last3=Hill|first3=Stuart|date=July 2003|title=Ecological Pioneers: A Social History of Australian Ecological Thought and Action|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3986208|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=481|doi=10.2307/3986208|issn=1084-5453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn|King|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy. Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design.

== Regenerative versus sustainable ==
[[regeneration (ecology)|Regenerative]] and [[sustainable]] are essentially the same thing except for one key point: in a sustainable system, lost [[ecological system]]s are not returned to existence. In a regenerative system, those lost systems can ultimately begin "regenerating" back into existence. Put more simply regenerative systems work using regenerative feedback loops that allows for [[adaptability]], dynamism and [[emergence]] to create and develop resilient systems than the idea that we need to a sustain the world the way we (humans) found it, now and into the future.

There is also a linguistic problem with the word "sustainable", which in the strict sense is meant to mean "[[self-sustaining]]". Because the word root "sustain" means "last" or "endure," the general public and even many non-experts in the industry define the word only as "able to last" or "the capacity to endure." In popular usage by designers and product manufacturers, "sustainable" has become a relative term referring to any material, process or product (including a building) which is less toxic or environmental harmful than those conventionally used.  A product that contains 75% [[recycled]] material is often considered "sustainable", but is in fact merely MORE sustainable than a comparable product that contains no recycled material.  A truly sustainable material would be one made of 100% recycled material that can, in turn, be completely recycled into a comparable new material or product.  This is rarely the case.

"Regenerative" also suffers from a slightly different linguistic problem, the term is still competing with the biological community in terms of its use for the [[regeneration (biology)|re-growth]] of limbs etc.. However once the word itself gains wide usage, its meaning becomes more general, much like in the case of the term "sustainable". The base meaning of "re-generative" means the "capacity to bring into existence again." So if an item or system is regenerative the item or system has the capacity to bring itself into existence again. Using the example above, a truly regenerative product would not only be 100% recycled and recyclable, but it would also improve the environmental conditions at the factory where it was made, the business where it was used and so on throughout its life-cycle (creating habitat, filtering water, catalyzing [[nitrogen-fixation]] processes in the soil, etc.).

== Preservation versus conservation ==
Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation. It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems. To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time. By incorporating people into ecosystems all inputs are pulled from local areas and all outputs are accounted for creating a waste-less system. 

== Food systems and business ==
Regenerative farming or '[[regenerative agriculture]]' calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment. It uses the [[science]] of [[systems ecology]], and the design and application through [[permaculture]]. As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for [[organic food]]. Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the [[biodiversity]] and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities. Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce. Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through [[Corporate social responsibility|ethical supply chains]], [[zero waste]] policies, [[Living wage|fair wages]], [[staff development]] and [[Wellbeing at Work conference|wellbeing]], and in some cases [[cooperative]] and [[social enterprise]] models. It seeks to benefit the staff along the [[supply chain]], customers, and ecosystems with the outcome of human and [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and regeneration.

== Size of regenerative systems ==
The size of the regenerative system effects the [[complexity]] of the design process. The smaller a [[system]] is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative. Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human-inclusive-ecological systems.

'''Risk''' is the possibility of losing something of value. Values (such as [[physical health]], [[social status]], emotional well-being, or financial wealth) can be gained or lost when taking risk resulting from a given action or inaction, foreseen or unforeseen (planned or not planned). Risk can also be defined as the intentional interaction with [[uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cline|first1=Preston B. |title=The Merging of Risk Analysis and Adventure Education|journal=Wilderness Risk Management|date=3 March 2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=43–45|url=https://www.outdoored.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/wrmc_proceedings_05_adventure_cline.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty is a potential, unpredictable, and uncontrollable outcome; risk is a consequence of action taken in spite of uncertainty.

[[Risk perception]] is the subjective judgment people make about the severity and probability of a risk, and may vary person to person. Any human endeavour carries some risk, but some are much riskier than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Risk|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/risk/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=9 May 2014|last1=Hansson |first1=Sven Ove|first2=Edward N. |last2=Zalta|date=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
[[File:3 Alarm Building Fire.jpg|thumb|Firefighters at work]]

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites the earliest use of the word in English (in the spelling of ''risque'' from its from French original,  'risque' ) as of 1621, and the spelling as ''risk'' from 1655. It defines ''risk'' as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Exposure to) the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# Risk is an influence affecting strategy caused by an incentive or condition that inhibits transformation to quality excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quest for Ascendant Quality|last=Elias|first=Victor|publisher=On QUEST|year=2017|isbn=9780999080115|location=Sparta, NJ USA|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has an effect on at least one [project] objective. (This definition, using project terminology, is easily made universal by removing references to projects).&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (4th Edition) ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
# The probability of something happening multiplied by the resulting cost or benefit if it does. (This concept is more properly known as the 'Expectation Value' or 'Risk Factor' and is used to compare levels of risk)
# The probability or threat of quantifiable damage, injury, liability, loss, or any other negative occurrence that is caused by external or internal vulnerabilities, and that may be avoided through preemptive action.
# Finance: The possibility that an actual return on an investment will be lower than the expected return.
# Insurance: A situation where the probability of a variable (such as burning down of a building) is known but when a mode of occurrence or the actual value of the occurrence (whether the fire will occur at a particular property) is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html|title=risk|last=|first=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A risk is not an uncertainty (where neither the probability nor the mode of occurrence is known), a peril (cause of loss), or a hazard (something that makes the occurrence of a peril more likely or more severe).
# Securities trading: The probability of a loss or drop in value. Trading risk is divided into two general categories: (1) [[Systematic risk]] affects all securities in the same class and is linked to the overall capital-market system and therefore cannot be eliminated by diversification. Also called [[market risk]]. (2) Non-systematic risk is any risk that isn't market-related. Also called non-market risk, extra-market risk or diversifiable risk.&lt;!-- Needs sorting out --&gt;
# [[Workplace]]: Product of the consequence and probability of a hazardous event or phenomenon. For example, the risk of developing cancer is estimated as the incremental probability of developing cancer over a lifetime as a result of exposure to potential carcinogens (cancer-causing substances).

=== International Organization for Standardization ===

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] publication [[ISO 31000]] (2009) / ISO Guide 73:2002 definition of risk is the 'effect of uncertainty on objectives'. In this definition, uncertainties include events (which may or may not happen) and uncertainties caused by ambiguity or a lack of information. It also includes both negative and positive impacts on objectives. Many definitions of risk exist in common usage, however this definition was developed by an international committee representing over 30 countries and is based on the input of several thousand subject matter experts.

=== Other ===

Very different approaches to risk management are taken in different fields, e.g. "Risk is the unwanted subset of a set of uncertain outcomes" (Cornelius Keating).

:Risk can be seen as relating to the [[probability]] of uncertain future events.&lt;ref name=FAIRW/&gt; For example, according to [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]], risk is:&lt;ref name=FAIRW&gt;[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=18 November 2014 }};.&lt;/ref&gt; the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss.  In computer science this definition is used by [[The Open Group]].&lt;ref name=OGC081&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

:OHSAS (Occupational Health &amp; Safety Advisory Services) defines risk as the combination of the probability of a hazard resulting in an adverse event, and the severity of the event.&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

:In [[information security]] risk is defined as "the potential that a given [[threat (computer)|threat]] will exploit [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] of an [[asset]] or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization".&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 27005:2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Financial risk]] is often defined as the unpredictable variability or [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of returns, and this would include both potential better-than-expected and worse-than-expected returns. References to negative risk below should be read as also applying to positive impacts or opportunity (e.g. for "loss" read "loss or gain") unless the context precludes this interpretation.

:The related terms "[[threat]]" and "[[hazard]]" are often used to mean something that could cause harm.

Risk is ubiquitous in all areas of life and risk management is something that we all must do, whether we are managing a major organisation or simply crossing the road.  When describing risk however, it is convenient to consider that risk practitioners operate in some specific practice areas.

===Economic risk===

Economic risks can be manifested in lower incomes or higher expenditures than expected. The causes can be many, for instance, the hike in the price for raw materials, the lapsing of deadlines for construction of a new operating facility, disruptions in a production process, emergence of a serious competitor on the market, the loss of key personnel, the change of a political regime, or natural disasters.

===Health===
Risks in personal health may be reduced by [[primary prevention]] actions that decrease early causes of illness or by [[secondary prevention]] actions after a person has clearly measured clinical signs or symptoms recognised as risk factors. Tertiary [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] reduces the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion of [[risk factors]] with individual patients to obtain [[informed consent]] for secondary and tertiary prevention efforts, whereas public health efforts in primary prevention require education of the entire population at risk. In each case, careful communication about risk factors, likely outcomes and [[certainty]] must distinguish between causal events that must be decreased and associated events that may be merely consequences rather than causes.

In epidemiology, the '''lifetime risk''' of an effect is the ''[[cumulative incidence]]'', also called ''incidence proportion'' over an entire lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |vauthors=Rychetnik L, Hawe P, Waters E, Barratt A, Frommer M |date=July 2004 |volume=58 |pages=538–45 |doi=10.1136/jech.2003.011585 |pmid=15194712 |pmc=1732833 |title=A glossary for evidence based public health |issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health, safety, and environment===
In terms of occupational health &amp; safety management, the term 'risk' may be defined as the most likely consequence of a hazard, combined with the likelihood or probability of it occurring.

Health, safety, and environment (HSE) are separate practice areas; however, they are often linked. The reason for this is typically to do with organizational management structures; however, there are strong links among these disciplines. One of the strongest links between these is that a single risk event may have impacts in all three areas, albeit over differing timescales. For example, the uncontrolled release of radiation or a toxic chemical may have immediate short-term safety consequences, more protracted health impacts, and much longer-term environmental impacts. Events such as Chernobyl, for example, caused immediate deaths, and in the longer term, deaths from cancers, and left a lasting environmental impact leading to birth defects, impacts on wildlife, etc.

Over time, a form of risk analysis called environmental risk analysis has developed. Environmental risk analysis is a field of study that attempts to understand events and activities that bring risk to human health or the environment.&lt;ref name="Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurjar|first=Bhola Ram|author2=Mohan, Manju |title=Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries|journal=Risk: Health, Safety &amp; Environment|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/risk13&amp;id=5&amp;collection=journals&amp;index=journals/risk|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human health and environmental risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome (See [[adverse outcome pathway]]). As such, risk is a function of hazard and exposure. Hazard is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed, e.g. the toxicity of a chemical compound. Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard. Therefore, the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero, given a person's (or other organism's) biological makeup, activities and location (See [[exposome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Vallero, Daniel A. (2016). "Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach." Amsterdam: Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-407776-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of health risks are when certain behaviours, such as [[risky sexual behaviour]]s, increase the likelihood of contracting HIV.&lt;ref name = Potter2013 &gt;{{cite book | last = Potter | first = Patricia | title = Fundamentals of nursing | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780323079334 | page=386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information technology and information security===
{{Main|IT risk}}
'''Information technology risk''', or '''IT risk''', '''IT-related risk''', is a risk related to information technology. This relatively new term was developed as a result of an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports.

The increasing dependencies of modern society on information and computers networks (both in private and public sectors, including military)&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Information assurance|Information security}}
'''Information security''' means protecting information and [[information system]]s from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|44|3542}}(b)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Information security grew out of practices and procedures of [[computer security]].&lt;br /&gt;
Information security has grown to '''information assurance (IA)''' i.e. is the practice of managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. &lt;br /&gt;
While focused dominantly on information in digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital but also analogue or physical form. &lt;br /&gt;
Information assurance is interdisciplinary and draws from multiple fields, including accounting, fraud examination, [[forensic science]], [[management science]], [[systems engineering]], [[security engineering]], and [[criminology]], in addition to computer science.

So, ''[[#Information technology risk|IT risk]]'' is narrowly focused on computer security, while ''information security'' extends to risks related to other forms of information (paper, microfilm). ''Information assurance'' risks include the ones related to the consistency of the business information stored in IT systems and the information stored by other means and the relevant business consequences.

===Insurance===
[[Insurance]] is a risk treatment option which involves risk sharing. It can be considered as a form of contingent capital and is akin to purchasing an [[Option (finance)|option]] in which the buyer pays a small premium to be protected from a potential large loss.

Insurance risk is often taken by insurance companies, who then bear a pool of risks including market risk, credit risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk, longevity risks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Elyasiani | first2 = Elyas | last3 = Mansur | first3 = Iqbal | year = 2008 | title = Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Interdependencies in Insurer Stock Returns: A System-GARCH Model | journal = The Journal of Risk and Insurance | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 873–891 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6975.2008.00289.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.568.4087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business and management===
Means of assessing risk vary widely between professions. Indeed, they may define these professions; for example, a doctor manages medical risk, while a civil engineer manages risk of structural failure. A professional [[code of ethics]] is usually focused on risk assessment and mitigation (by the professional on behalf of client, public, society or life in general).

In the workplace, incidental and [[inherent risk]]s exist. Incidental risks are those that occur naturally in the business but are not part of the core of the business. Inherent risks have a negative effect on the operating profit of the business.

===In human services===
The experience of many people who rely on human services for support is that 'risk' is often used as a reason to prevent them from gaining further independence or fully accessing the community, and that these services are often unnecessarily risk averse.&lt;ref&gt;A Positive Approach To Risk Requires Person Centred Thinking, Neill et al., Tizard Learning Disability Review http://pierprofessional.metapress.com/content/vr700311x66j0125/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "People's autonomy used to be compromised by institution walls, now it's too often our risk management practices", according to [[John O'Brien (human services thinker)|John O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;John O'Brien cited in Sanderson, H. Lewis, J. A Practical Guide to Delivering Personalisation; Person Centred Practice in Health and Social Care p211&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Fischer and Ewan Ferlie (2013) find that contradictions between formal risk controls and the role of subjective factors in human services (such as the role of emotions and ideology) can undermine service values, so producing tensions and even intractable and 'heated' conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan |title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High reliability organisations (HROs)===
A [[high reliability organisation]] (HRO) is an organisation that has succeeded in avoiding catastrophes in an environment where [[normal accident]]s can be expected due to risk factors and [[Complex system|complexity]].  Most studies of HROs involve areas such as nuclear aircraft carriers, air traffic control, aerospace and nuclear power stations. Organizations such as these share in common the ability to consistently operate safely in complex, interconnected environments where a single failure in one component could lead to catastrophe. Essentially, they are organisations which appear to operate 'in spite' of an enormous range of risks.

Some of these industries manage risk in a highly quantified and enumerated way. These include the [[nuclear power]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aircraft industries]], where the possible failure of a complex series of engineered systems could result in highly undesirable outcomes. The usual measure of risk for a class of events is then: ''R'' = probability of the event × the severity of the consequence.

The total risk is then the sum of the individual class-risks;  see below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety, Reliability and Risk Analysis: Theory, Methods and Applications|last=Sebastián Martorell, Carlos Guedes Soares, Julie Barnett|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781482266481|location=|pages=671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nuclear industry, consequence is often measured in terms of off-site radiological release, and this is often banded into five or six-decade-wide bands.{{Clarify|reason=define "decade-wide bands":  factor of 10 regarding what?|date=August 2013}}

The risks are evaluated using fault tree/event tree techniques (see [[safety engineering]]). Where these risks are low, they are normally considered to be "broadly acceptable". A higher level of risk (typically up to 10 to 100 times what is considered broadly acceptable) has to be justified against the costs of reducing it further and the possible benefits that make it tolerable—these risks are described as "Tolerable if [[ALARP]]", where ALARP stands for "as low as reasonably practicable". Risks beyond this level are classified as "intolerable".

The level of risk deemed broadly acceptable has been considered by regulatory bodies in various countries—an early attempt by UK government regulator and academic [[F. R. Farmer]] used the example of hill-walking and similar activities, which have definable risks that people appear to find acceptable. This resulted in the so-called Farmer Curve of acceptable probability of an event versus its consequence.

The technique as a whole is usually referred to as probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) (or probabilistic safety assessment, PSA). See [[WASH-1400]] for an example of this approach.

===Finance===
{{Main|Financial risk}}

In finance, risk is the chance that the return achieved on an investment will be different from that expected, and also takes into account the size of the difference. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. In a view advocated by Damodaran, risk includes not only "[[downside risk]]" but also "upside risk" (returns that exceed expectations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Investment Philosophies: Successful Investment Philosophies and the Greatest Investors Who Made Them Work |first=Aswath |last=Damodaran |page=15 |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-34503-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard the [[standard deviation]] of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment as providing some historical measure of risk; see modern portfolio theory. Financial risk may be market-dependent, determined by numerous market factors, or operational, resulting from fraudulent behaviour (e.g. [[Bernard Madoff]]).

A fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return (see [[modern portfolio theory]]). The greater the potential return one might seek, the greater the risk that one generally assumes. A free market reflects this principle in the pricing of an instrument: strong demand for a safer instrument drives its price higher (and its return correspondingly lower) while weak demand for a riskier instrument drives its price lower (and its potential return thereby higher). For example, a US Treasury bond is considered to be one of the safest investments. In comparison to an investment or speculative grade corporate bond, US Treasury notes and bonds yield lower rates of return. The reason for this is that a corporation is more likely to default on debt than the US government. Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a correspondingly higher rate of return.

A popular [[risk measure]] is [[Value-at-Risk]] (VaR).

There are different types of VaR: long term VaR, marginal VaR, factor VaR and shock VaR. The latter is used in measuring risk during the extreme market stress conditions.

In finance, ''risk'' has no single definition.

Extreme value methods with applications to finance. London: CRC. {{ISBN|978-1-43983-574-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "risk is a possibility of an undesirable event".

In financial markets, one may need to measure [[credit risk]], information timing and source risk, probability model risk, operational risk and [[legal risk]] if there are regulatory or civil actions taken as a result of "[[investor's regret]]".

With the advent of automation in financial markets, the concept of "real-time risk" has gained a lot of attention.  Aldridge and Krawciw&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, I., Krawciw, S., 2017. Real-Time Risk: What Investors Should Know About Fintech, High-Frequency Trading and Flash Crashes. Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-1119318965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; define real-time risk as the probability of instantaneous or near-instantaneous loss, and can be due to flash crashes, other market crises, malicious activity by selected market participants and other events.  A well-cited example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-knightcapital-results-idUSBRE89G0HI20121017|title=Knight Capital posts $389.9 million loss on trading glitch|first=John|last=McCrank|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of real-time risk was a US $440 million loss incurred within 30 minutes by Knight Capital Group (KCG) on 1 August 2012; the culprit was a poorly-tested runaway algorithm deployed by the firm. Regulators have taken notice of real-time risk as well.  Basel III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm|title=Basel III: international regulatory framework for banks|date=7 December 2017|website=www.bis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires real-time risk management framework for bank stability.

It is not always obvious if [[financial instruments]] are "[[Hedge (finance)|hedging]]" (purchasing/selling a financial instrument specifically to reduce or cancel out the risk in another investment) or "speculation" (increasing measurable risk and exposing the investor to catastrophic loss in pursuit of very high windfalls that increase expected value).

Some people may be "[[risk seeking]]", i.e. their [[utility function]]'s second derivative is positive. Such an individual willingly pays a premium to assume risk (e.g. buys a lottery ticket).

=== {{anchor|Risk in auditing}} Financial auditing ===
{{Main|Audit risk}}
The [[audit risk|financial audit risk model]] expresses the risk of an [[auditor]] providing an inappropriate opinion (or material misstatement) of a commercial entity's financial statements. It can be analytically expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt; \text{AR} = \text{IR} \times \text{CR} \times \text{DR}&lt;/math&gt;
where AR is ''audit risk'', IR is ''[[Inherent risk (accounting)|inherent risk]]'', CR is ''control risk'' and DR is ''detection risk''.

Note: As defined, audit risk does not consider the impact of an auditor misstatement and so is stated as a simple probability. The impact of misstatement must be considered when determining an acceptable audit risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Risk Management and Corporate Governance: Interconnections in Law: Chapter: Risk Management from an accounting perspective | author = Arco van de Ven |pages = 16–17 |editors = Marijn van Daelen, Christoph van der Elst }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
[[File:AT YOUR OWN RISK.svg|thumb|166px|'''AT YOUR OWN RISK'''&lt;br /&gt;Popular labelling]]
Security risk management involves protection of assets from harm caused by deliberate acts. A more detailed definition is: "A security risk is any event that could result in the compromise of organizational assets i.e. the unauthorized use, loss, damage, disclosure or modification of organizational assets for the profit, personal interest or political interests of individuals, groups or other entities constitutes a compromise of the asset, and includes the risk of harm to people. Compromise of organizational assets may adversely affect the enterprise, its business units and their clients. As such, consideration of security risk is a vital component of risk management."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Talbot and Miles Jakeman ''Security Risk Management Body of Knowledge'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human factors===
{{Main|Decision theory|Prospect theory}}
One of the growing areas of focus in risk management is the field of [[human factors]] where behavioural and organizational psychology underpin our understanding of risk based decision making. This field considers questions such as "how do we make risk based decisions?", "why are we irrationally more scared of sharks and terrorists than we are of motor vehicles and medications?"

In [[decision theory]], regret (and anticipation of regret) can play a significant part in decision-making, distinct from [[risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;Virine, L., &amp; Trumper, M. ProjectThink. Gower. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virine, L., &amp; Trumper, M. Project Risk Analysis Made Ridiculously Simple. World Scientific Publishing. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;(preferring the status quo in case one becomes worse off).

[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]&lt;ref&gt;Amos Tversky / Daniel Kahneman, 1981. "The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice."{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fundamental problem with all forms of risk assessment. In particular, because of [[bounded rationality]] (our brains get overloaded, so we take mental shortcuts), the risk of extreme events is discounted because the probability is too low to evaluate intuitively. As an example, one of the leading causes of death is [[road accident]]s caused by [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] – partly because any given driver frames the problem by largely or totally ignoring the risk of a serious or fatal accident.

For instance, an extremely disturbing event (an attack by hijacking, or [[moral hazard]]s) may be ignored in analysis despite the fact it has occurred and has a nonzero probability. Or, an event that everyone agrees is inevitable may be ruled out of analysis due to greed or an unwillingness to admit that it is believed to be inevitable. These human tendencies for error and [[wishful thinking]] often affect even the most rigorous applications of the [[scientific method]] and are a major concern of the [[philosophy of science]].

All [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision-making under uncertainty]] must consider [[cognitive bias]], [[cultural bias]], and notational bias: No group of people assessing risk is immune to "[[groupthink]]": acceptance of obviously wrong answers simply because it is socially painful to disagree, where there are [[conflicts of interest]].

Framing involves other information that affects the outcome of a risky decision.  The right prefrontal cortex has been shown to take a more global perspective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schatz | first1 = J. | last2 = Craft | first2 = S. | last3 = Koby | first3 = M. | last4 = DeBaun | first4 = M.

Rightward tapping or listening had the effect of narrowing attention such that the frame was ignored.  This is a practical way of manipulating regional cortical activation to affect risky decisions, especially because directed tapping or listening is easily done.

===Psychology of risk taking===

A growing area of research has been to examine various psychological aspects of risk taking. Researchers typically run randomised experiments with a treatment and control group to ascertain the effect of different psychological factors that may be associated with risk taking. Thus, positive and negative feedback about past risk taking can affect future risk taking. In an experiment, people who were led to believe they are very competent at decision making saw more opportunities in a risky choice and took more risks, while those led to believe they were not very competent saw more threats and took fewer risks.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Norris, and Peter R. Dickson. "How believing in ourselves increases risk taking: perceived self-efficacy and opportunity recognition." Decision Sciences 25, no. 3 (1994): 385–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance===
The concept of risk-based maintenance is an advanced form of [[Reliability centred maintenance]]. In case of chemical industries, apart from probability of failure, consequences of failure is also very important. Therefore, the selection of maintenance policies should be based on risk, instead of reliability. Risk-based maintenance methodology acts as a tool for maintenance planning and decision making to reduce the probability of failure and its consequences. In risk-based maintenance decision making, the maintenance resources can be used optimally based on the risk class (high, medium, or low) of equipment or machines, to achieve tolerable risk criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389406007345 | doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.069 | pmid=16887261 | volume=142 | issue=3 | title=Risk-based maintenance—Techniques and applications | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials | pages=653–661 | last1 = Arunraj | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Maiti | first2 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'But despite the number of agencies involved, cybersecurity generally seems to have slipped in importance for the administration&lt;/ref&gt;===
Closely related to information assurance and security risk, cybersecurity is the application of system security engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2016/NIST-Releases-SP-800-160-Sys-Security-Engineering|title=NIST Releases SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering|first=Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of|last=Commerce|date=15 November 2016|website=csrc.nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to address the compromise of company cyber-assets required for business or mission purposes. In order to address cyber-risk, cybersecurity applies security to the supply chain, the design and production environment for a product or service, and the product itself in order to provide efficient and appropriate security commensurate with the value of the asset to the mission or business process.

==Risk assessment and analysis==
{{Main|Risk assessment|Operational risk management}}
Since risk assessment and management is essential in security management, both are tightly related. Security assessment methodologies like [[CRAMM]] contain risk assessment modules as an important part of the first steps of the methodology. On the other hand, risk assessment methodologies like [[Mehari]] evolved to become security assessment methodologies.
An [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard on risk management (Principles and guidelines on implementation) was published under code [[ISO 31000]] on 13 November 2009.

===Quantitative analysis===
There are many formal methods used to "measure" risk.

Often the probability of a negative event is estimated by using the frequency of past similar events. Probabilities for rare failures may be difficult to estimate. This makes risk assessment difficult in hazardous industries, for example nuclear energy, where the frequency of failures is rare, while harmful consequences of failure are severe.

Statistical methods may also require the use of a [[Loss function|cost function]], which in turn may require the calculation of the cost of loss of a human life. This is a difficult problem. One approach is to ask what people are willing to pay to insure against death&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first = Steven|last = Landsburg|title = Is your life worth $10&amp;nbsp;million?|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2079475/|work = Everyday Economics|publisher = Slate|date = 3 March 2003|accessdate = 17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or radiological release (e.g. GBq of radio-iodine), {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but as the answers depend very strongly on the circumstances it is not clear that this approach is effective.

Risk is often measured as the [[expected value]] of an undesirable outcome. This combines the probabilities of various possible events and some assessment of the corresponding harm into a single value. See also [[Expected utility]].  The simplest case is a binary possibility of ''Accident'' or ''No accident''. The associated formula for calculating risk is then:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{R} = (\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \times  (\text{expected loss in case of the accident})&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, then total risk is a loss of 10, the product of 0.01 and 1000.

Situations are sometimes more complex than the simple binary possibility case. In a situation with several possible accidents, total risk is the sum of the risks for each different accident, provided that the outcomes are comparable:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{R} =  \sum_\text{For all accidents} (\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \times  (\text{expected loss in case of the accident})&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, and a probability of 0.000001 of suffering an accident of type ''B'', with a loss of 2,000,000, then total loss expectancy is 12, which is equal to a loss of 10 from an accident of type ''A'' and 2 from an accident of type ''B''.

One of the first major uses of this concept was for the planning of the [[Delta Works]] in 1953, a flood protection program in the [[Netherlands]], with the aid of the mathematician [[David van Dantzig]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wired Magazine]], [https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/17-01/ff_dutch_delta?currentPage=3 Before the levees break], page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The kind of risk analysis pioneered there has become common today in fields like nuclear power, [[aerospace]] and the [[chemical industry]].

In statistical decision theory, the [[risk function]] is defined as the expected value of a given [[loss function]] as a function of the [[decision rule]] used to make decisions in the face of uncertainty.

===Fear as intuitive risk assessment===
People may rely on their [[fear processing in the brain|fear]] and hesitation to keep them out of the most profoundly unknown circumstances. Fear is a response to perceived danger. Risk could be said to be the way we collectively measure and share this "true fear"—a fusion of rational doubt, irrational fear, and a set of unquantified biases from our own experience.

The field of [[behavioural finance]] focuses on human risk-aversion, asymmetric regret, and other ways that human financial behaviour varies from what analysts call "rational". Risk in that case is the degree of [[uncertainty]] associated with a [[return (finance)|return]] on an asset.  Recognizing and respecting the irrational influences on human decision making may do much to reduce disasters caused by naive risk assessments that presume rationality but in fact merely fuse many shared biases.

==Anxiety, risk and decision making==

===Fear, anxiety and risk===
According to one set of definitions, fear is a fleeting emotion ascribed to a particular object, while [[anxiety]] is a trait of fear (this is referring to "trait anxiety", as distinct from how the term "anxiety" is generally used) that lasts longer and is not attributed to a specific stimulus (these particular definitions are not used by all authors cited on this page).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartley | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 2012| title = Anxiety and Decision-Making | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 | pmid = 22325982 | pmc = 3864559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show a link between anxious behaviour and risk (the chance that an outcome will have an unfavorable result).&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gertner. What Are We Afraid Of, Money 32.5 (2003): 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Forgas introduced [[valence (psychology)|valence]] based research where emotions are grouped as either positive or negative (Lerner and Keltner, 2000). Positive emotions, such as happiness, are believed to have more optimistic risk assessments and negative emotions, such as anger, have pessimistic risk assessments.  As an emotion with a negative valence, fear, and therefore anxiety, has long been associated with negative risk perceptions.  Under the more recent appraisal tendency framework of Jennifer Lerner et al., which refutes Forgas' notion of valence and promotes the idea that specific emotions have distinctive influences on judgments, fear is still related to pessimistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Jennifer S. | last2 = Keltner | first2 = Dacher | year = 2000 | title = Beyond Valence: Toward A Model of Emotion-Specific Influences on Judgment and Choice | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 473–493 | doi=10.1080/026999300402763| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.6023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have demonstrated that increases in anxiety and increases in [[risk perception]] are related and people who are habituated to anxiety experience this awareness of risk more intensely than normal individuals.&lt;ref name="Jon"&gt;Jon K. Maner, Norman B. Schmidt, The Role of Risk Avoidance in Anxiety, Behavior Therapy, Volume 37, Issue 2, June 2006, pp. 181–189, {{ISSN|0005-7894}}, 10.1016/j.beth.2005.11.003.&lt;/ref&gt; In decision-making, anxiety promotes the use of biases and quick thinking to evaluate risk.  This is referred to as affect-as-information according to Clore, 1983.  However, the accuracy of these risk perceptions when making choices is not known.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Constans | first1 = Joseph I. | year = 2001| title = Worry propensity and the perception of risk | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 721–729 | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7967(00)00037-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences of anxiety ===
Experimental studies show that brief surges in anxiety are correlated with surges in general risk perception.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt; Anxiety exists when the presence of threat is perceived (Maner and Schmidt, 2006).&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt; As risk perception increases, it stays related to the particular source impacting the mood change as opposed to spreading to unrelated risk factors.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt; This increased awareness of a threat is significantly more emphasised in people who are conditioned to anxiety.&lt;ref name="Jon_a"&gt;Jon K. Maner, J. Anthony Richey, Kiara Cromer, Mike Mallott, Carl W. Lejuez, Thomas E. Joiner, Norman B. Schmidt, Dispositional anxiety and risk-avoidant decision-making, Personality and Individual Differences, Volume 42, Issue 4, March 2007, pp. 665–675, {{ISSN|0191-8869}}, 10.1016/j.paid.2006.08.016.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anxious individuals who are predisposed to generating reasons for negative results tend to exhibit pessimism.&lt;ref name="Jon_a" /&gt; Also, findings suggest that the perception of a lack of control and a lower inclination to participate in risky decision-making (across various behavioural circumstances) is associated with individuals experiencing relatively high levels of trait anxiety.&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt; In the previous instance, there is supporting clinical research that links emotional evaluation (of control), the anxiety that is felt and the option of risk avoidance.&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt;

There are various views presented that anxious/fearful emotions cause people to access involuntary responses and judgments when making decisions that involve risk.  Joshua A. Hemmerich et al. probes deeper into anxiety and its impact on choices by exploring "risk-as-feelings" which are quick, automatic, and natural reactions to danger that are based on emotions.  This notion is supported by an experiment that engages physicians in a simulated perilous surgical procedure.  It was demonstrated that a measurable amount of the participants' anxiety about patient outcomes was related to previous (experimentally created) regret and worry and ultimately caused the physicians to be led by their feelings over any information or guidelines provided during the mock surgery.  Additionally, their emotional levels, adjusted along with the simulated patient status, suggest that anxiety level and the respective decision made are correlated with the type of bad outcome that was experienced in the earlier part of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua A. Hemmerich, Arthur S. Elstein, Margaret L. Schwarze, Elizabeth Ghini Moliski, William Dale, Risk as feelings in the effect of patient outcomes on physicians' future treatment decisions: A randomized trial and manipulation validation, Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine, Volume 75, Issue 2, July 2012, pp. 367–376, {{ISSN|0277-9536}}, 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.03.020.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another view of anxiety and decision-making is dispositional anxiety where emotional states, or [[mood (psychology)|moods]], are cognitive and provide information about future pitfalls and rewards (Maner and Schmidt, 2006).  When experiencing anxiety, individuals draw from personal judgments referred to as pessimistic outcome appraisals.  These emotions promote biases for risk avoidance and promote risk tolerance in decision-making.&lt;ref name="Jon_a" /&gt;

===Dread risk===
It is common for people to dread some risks but not others: They tend to be very afraid of epidemic diseases, nuclear power plant failures, and plane accidents but are relatively unconcerned about some highly frequent and deadly events, such as traffic crashes, household accidents, and medical errors. One key distinction of dreadful risks seems to be their potential for catastrophic consequences,&lt;ref name="Slovic P 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slovic | first1 = P | year = 1987 | title = Perception of risk | journal = Science | volume = 236 | issue = 4799 | pages = 280–285 | doi=10.1126/science.3563507| bibcode = 1987Sci...236..280S }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatening to kill a large number of people within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer G (2004) Dread risk, 11 September, and fatal traffic accidents. Psych Sci 15:286−287.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, immediately after the 11 September attacks, many Americans were afraid to fly and took their car instead, a decision that led to a significant increase in the number of fatal crashes in the time period following the 9/11 event compared with the same time period before the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaissmaier | first1 = W. | last2 = Gigerenzer | first2 = G. | year = 2012 | title = 9/11, Act II: A fine-grained analysis of regional variations in traffic fatalities in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 1449–1454 | doi=10.1177/0956797612447804| pmid = 23160203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein S 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lichtenstein | first1 = S | last2 = Slovic | first2 = P | last3 = Fischhoff | first3 = B | last4 = Layman | first4 = M | last5 = Combs | first5 = B | year = 1978 | title = Judged frequency of lethal events | journal =  Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory| volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–578 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.4.6.551| hdl = 1794/22549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why people fear dread risks. First, the psychometric paradigm&lt;ref name="Slovic P 1987"/&gt; suggests that high lack of control, high catastrophic potential, and severe consequences account for the increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks. Second, because people estimate the frequency of a risk by recalling instances of its occurrence from their social circle or the media, they may overvalue relatively rare but dramatic risks because of their overpresence and undervalue frequent, less dramatic risks.&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein S 1978"/&gt; Third, according to the preparedness hypothesis, people are prone to fear events that have been particularly threatening to survival in human evolutionary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Öhman | first1 = A | last2 = Mineka | first2 = S | year = 2001 | title = Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning | journal = Psychol Rev | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 483–522 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.3.483| pmid = 11488376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that in most of human evolutionary history people lived in relatively small groups, rarely exceeding 100 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = KR | last2 = Walker | first2 = RS | last3 = Bozicevic | first3 = M | last4 = Eder | first4 = J | last5 = Headland | first5 = T | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Co-residence patterns in hunter-gatherer societies show unique human social structure | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6022 | pages = 1286–1289 | doi=10.1126/science.1199071| pmid = 21393537 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331.1286H }}&lt;/ref&gt; a dread risk, which kills many people at once, could potentially wipe out one's whole group. Indeed, research found&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galesic | first1 = M | last2 = Garcia-Retamero | first2 = R | year = 2012 | title = The risks we dread: A social circle account | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e32837 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032837| pmid = 22509250 | pmc = 3324481 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...732837G }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people's fear peaks for risks killing around 100 people but does not increase if larger groups are killed. Fourth, fearing dread risks can be an ecologically rational strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bodemer | first1 = N. | last2 = Ruggeri | first2 = A. | last3 = Galesic | first3 = M. | year = 2013 | title = When dread risks are more dreadful than continuous risks: Comparing cumulative population losses over time | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | page = e66544 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066544| pmid = 23840503 | pmc = 3694073 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...866544B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides killing a large number of people at a single point in time, dread risks reduce the number of children and young adults who would have potentially produced offspring. Accordingly, people are more concerned about risks killing younger, and hence more fertile, groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = XT | year = 1996 | title = Evolutionary hypotheses of risk-sensitive choice: Age differences and perspective change | journal = Ethol Sociobiol | volume = 17 | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00103-4| citeseerx = 10.1.1.201.816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety and judgmental accuracy===
The relationship between higher levels of risk perception and "judgmental accuracy" in anxious individuals remains unclear (Joseph I. Constans, 2001).  There is a chance that "judgmental accuracy" is correlated with heightened anxiety.  Constans conducted a study to examine how worry propensity (and current mood and trait anxiety) might influence college student's estimation of their performance on an upcoming exam, and the study found that worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias (errors in their risk assessments), even after variance attributable to current mood and trait anxiety had been removed.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt; Another experiment suggests that trait anxiety is associated with pessimistic risk appraisals (heightened perceptions of the probability and degree of suffering associated with a negative experience), while controlling for depression.&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt;

==Other considerations==
===Risk and uncertainty===
In his seminal work ''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'', [[Frank Knight]] (1921) established the distinction between risk and uncertainty.
{{quote|... Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. The term "risk," as loosely used in everyday speech and in economic discussion, really covers two things which, functionally at least, in their causal relations to the phenomena of economic organization, are categorically different. ... The essential fact is that "risk" means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomenon depending on which of the two is really present and operating. ... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or "risk" proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We ... accordingly restrict the term "uncertainty" to cases of the non-quantitive type.:&lt;ref&gt;Frank Hyneman Knight "Risk, uncertainty and profit" pg. 19, Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Prize Essays, no. 31. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin. 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, [[Knightian uncertainty]] is immeasurable, not possible to calculate, while in the Knightian sense risk is measurable.

Another distinction between risk and uncertainty is proposed by Douglas Hubbard:&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hubbard "How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business" pg. 46, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Douglas Hubbard "The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009. Page 22 of https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066599/files/37549842/download?verifier=ar2VjVOxCU8sEQr23I5LEBpr89B6fnwmoJgBinqj&amp;wrap=1&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Uncertainty''': The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. The "true" outcome/state/result/value is not known.
:'''Measurement of uncertainty''': A set of probabilities assigned to a set of possibilities. Example: "There is a 60% chance this market will double in five years"
:'''Risk''': A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.
:'''Measurement of risk''': A set of possibilities each with quantified probabilities and quantified losses. Example: "There is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs".

In this sense, one may have uncertainty without risk but not risk without uncertainty. We can be uncertain about the winner of a contest, but unless we have some personal stake in it, we have no risk. If we bet money on the outcome of the contest, then we have a risk. In both cases there are more than one outcome. The measure of uncertainty refers only to the probabilities assigned to outcomes, while the measure of risk requires both probabilities for outcomes and losses quantified for outcomes.

===Risk attitude, appetite and tolerance===
{{Main|Risk aversion}}

The terms ''risk attitude'', ''appetite'', and ''tolerance'' are often used similarly to describe an organisation's or individual's attitude towards risk-taking. One's attitude may be described as ''risk-averse'', ''risk-neutral'', or ''risk-seeking''. Risk tolerance looks at acceptable/unacceptable deviations from what is expected.{{unclear inline|date=May 2017}} Risk appetite looks at how much risk one is willing to accept. There can still be deviations that are within a risk appetite. For example, recent research finds that insured individuals are significantly likely to divest from risky asset holdings in response to a decline in health, controlling for variables such as income, age, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_23.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Health and the Savings of Insured versus Uninsured, Working-Age Households in the U.S.'', November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambling is a risk-increasing investment, wherein money on hand is risked for a possible large return, but with the possibility of losing it all. Purchasing a lottery ticket is a very risky investment with a high chance of no return and a small chance of a very high return. In contrast, putting money in a bank at a defined rate of interest is a risk-averse action that gives a guaranteed return of a small gain and precludes other investments with possibly higher gain.  The possibility of getting no return on an investment is also known as the [[rate of ruin]].

===Risk as a vector quantity===
Hubbard also argues that defining risk as the product of impact and probability presumes, unrealistically, that decision-makers are [[risk-neutral]].&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA"/&gt; A risk-neutral person's utility is proportional to the [[expected value]] of the payoff. For example, a risk-neutral person would consider 20% chance of winning $1&amp;nbsp;million exactly as desirable as getting a certain $200,000. However, most decision-makers are not actually risk-neutral and would not consider these equivalent choices. This gave rise to [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]]. Hubbard proposes to instead describe risk as a [[Vector space|vector]] quantity that distinguishes the probability and magnitude of a risk. Risks are simply described as a set or function{{vague|date=May 2017}} of possible payoffs (gains or losses) with their associated probabilities. This array is collapsed into a scalar value according to a decision-maker's [[risk aversion|risk tolerance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22297">Transcription Activator Like Effector Likes ('''TALE-likes''')  are a group of bacterial [[DNA-binding protein|DNA binding proteins]] named for the first and still best studied group, the [[TAL effector|TALEs]] of ''Xanthomonas'' bacteria. TALEs are important factors in the plant diseases caused by ''Xanthomonas'' bacteria, but are known primarily for their role in biotechnology as programmable DNA binding proteins, particularly in the context of [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALE nucleases]].  TALE-likes have additionally been found in many strains of the [[#RipTALs|''Ralstonia solanacearum'']] bacterial species complex, in  [[#Burkholderia TALE-likes|''Burkholderia rhizoxinica'' strain HKI 454]], and in [[#MOrTL1 and MOrTL2|two unknown marine bacteria]]. Whether or not all these proteins from a single phylogenetic grouping is as yet unclear.

The unifying feature of the TALE-likes are their tandem arrays of DNA binding repeats. These repeats are, with few exceptions, 33-35 amino acids in length, and composed of two alpha-helices on either side of a flexible loop containing the DNA base binding residues and with neighbouring repeats joined by flexible linker loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Dong|last2=Yan|first2=Chuangye|last3=Wu|first3=Jianping|last4=Pan|first4=Xiaojing|last5=Yan|first5=Nieng|title=Revisiting the TALE repeat|journal=Protein &amp; Cell|date=14 March 2014|volume=5|issue=4|pages=297–306|doi=10.1007/s13238-014-0035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this common structure comes in part from solved crystal structures of TALEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=D.|last2=Yan|first2=C.|last3=Pan|first3=X.|last4=Mahfouz|first4=M.|last5=Wang|first5=J.|last6=Zhu|first6=J.-K.|last7=Shi|first7=Y.|last8=Yan|first8=N.|title=Structural Basis for Sequence-Specific Recognition of DNA by TAL Effectors|journal=Science|date=5 January 2012|volume=335|issue=6069|pages=720–723|doi=10.1126/science.1215670|pmid=22223738|pmc=3586824|bibcode=2012Sci...335..720D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a ''Burkholderia'' TALE-like,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stella|first1=Stefano|last2=Molina|first2=Rafael|last3=López-Méndez|first3=Blanca|last4=Juillerat|first4=Alexandre|last5=Bertonati|first5=Claudia|last6=Daboussi|first6=Fayza|last7=Campos-Olivas|first7=Ramon|last8=Duchateau|first8=Phillippe|last9=Montoya|first9=Guillermo|title=BuD, a helix–loop–helix DNA-binding domain for genome modification|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section D|date=29 June 2014|volume=70|issue=7|pages=2042–2052|doi=10.1107/S1399004714011183|pmid=25004980|pmc=4089491}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also from the conservation of the code that all TALE-likes use to recognise DNA-sequences.

== TALEs ==
[[TAL effector|TALEs]] are the first identified, best-studied and largest group within the TALE-likes. TALEs are found throughout the bacterial genus ''Xanthomonas'',&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Rafael Marini|last2=de Oliveira|first2=Amanda Carolina P.|last3=Moreira|first3=Leandro M.|last4=Belasque|first4=José|last5=Gourbeyre|first5=Edith|last6=Siguier|first6=Patricia|last7=Ferro|first7=Maria Inês T.|last8=Ferro|first8=Jesus A.|last9=Chandler|first9=Michael|last10=Varani|first10=Alessandro M.|title=A TALE of Transposition: Tn-Like Transposons Play a Major Role in the Spread of Pathogenicity Determinants of Xanthomonas citri and Other Xanthomonads|journal=mBio|date=17 February 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=e02505-14|doi=10.1128/mBio.02505-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising mostly plant pathogens. Those TALEs which have been studied have all been shown to be secreted as part of the Type III secretion system into host plant cells. Once inside the host cell they translocate to the nucleus, bind specific DNA sequences within host promoters and turn on downstream genes. Every part of this process is thought to be conserved across all TALEs. The single meaningful difference between individual TALEs, based on current understanding, is the specific DNA sequence that each TALE binds. TALEs from even closely related strains differ in the composition of repeats that make up their DNA binding domain.&lt;ref name=PerezQunitero2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pérez-Quintero|first1=Alvaro L.|last2=Lamy|first2=Léo|last3=Gordon|first3=Jonathan L.|last4=Escalon|first4=Aline|last5=Cunnac|first5=Sébastien|last6=Szurek|first6=Boris|last7=Gagnevin|first7=Lionel|title=QueTAL: a suite of tools to classify and compare TAL effectors functionally and phylogenetically|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=3 August 2015|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeat composition determines DNA binding preference. In particular position 13 of each repeat confers the DNA base preference of each repeat. During early research it was noted that almost all the differences between repeats of a single TALE repeat array are found in positions 12 and 13 and this finding led to the hypothesis that these residues determine base preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boch|first1=Jens|last2=Schornack|first2=Sebastian|title=Unraveling a 20-Year Enigma|journal=IS-MPMI reporter|date=2010|issue=1|pages=3–4|url=http://www.ismpmi.org/members/IS-MPMI-Reporter/Documents/Archives/1001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact repeat positions 12 and 13, referred to jointly as the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD) are commonly said to confer base specificity despite clear evidence that position 13 is the base determining residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Binder|first2=Andreas|last3=Lahaye|first3=Thomas|title=From dead leaf, to new life: TAL effectors as tools for synthetic biology|journal=The Plant Journal|date=June 2014|volume=78|issue=5|pages=753–771|doi=10.1111/tpj.12431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the repeat domain TALEs  also possess a number of conserved features in the domains flanking the repeats. These include domains for type-III-secretion, nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. This allows TALEs to carry out their biological role as effector proteins secreted into host plant cells to activate expression of specific host genes.

'''Diversity and evolution'''

Whilst the RVD positions are commonly the only variable positions within a single TALE repeat array it should be noted that there are more differences when comparing repeat arrays of different TALEs. The diversity of TALEs across the Xanthomonas genus is considerable, but a particularly striking finding is that the evolutionary history one arrives at by comparing repeat compositions differs from that found when comparing non-repeat sequences.&lt;ref name=PerezQunitero2015/&gt; Repeat arrays of TALEs are thought to evolve rapidly, with a number of recombinatorial processes suggested to shape repeat array evolution.&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015/&gt; Recombination of TALE repeat arrays has been demonstrated in a forced-selection experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Bing|last2=Sugio|first2=Akiko|last3=White|first3=Frank F.|title=Avoidance of Host Recognition by Alterations in the Repetitive and C-Terminal Regions of AvrXa7, a Type III Effector of                            pv.|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|date=February 2005|volume=18|issue=2|pages=142–149|doi=10.1094/MPMI-18-0142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary dynamism is though to be made possible by the very high sequence identity of TALE repeats, which is a unique feature of TALEs as opposed to other TALE-likes.

'''T-zero'''

Another unique feature of TALEs is a set of four repeat structures at the N-terminal flank of the core repeat array. These structures, termed non-canonical or degenerate repeats have been shown to be vital for DNA binding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Haishan|last2=Wu|first2=Xiaojing|last3=Chai|first3=Jijie|last4=Han|first4=Zhifu|title=Crystal structure of a TALE protein reveals an extended N-terminal DNA binding region|journal=Cell Research|date=13 November 2012|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1716–1720|doi=10.1038/cr.2012.156|pmc=3515758}}&lt;/ref&gt; though all but one do not contact DNA bases and thus make no contribution to sequence preference. The one exception is repeat -1, which encodes a fixed T-zero preference to all TALEs. This means that the target sequences of TALEs are always preceded by a thymine base. This is thought to be common to all TALEs, with the possible exception of TalC from ''Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae'' strain AXO1947.

'''Discovery and molecular properties'''

It was noted in the 2002 publication of the genome of reference strain ''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]'' GMI1000 that its genome encodes a protein similar to ''Xanthomonas'' TALEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salanoubat|first1=M.|last2=Genin|first2=S.|last3=Artiguenave|first3=F.|last4=Gouzy|first4=J.|last5=Mangenot|first5=S.|last6=Arlat|first6=M.|last7=Billault|first7=A.|last8=Brottier|first8=P.|last9=Camus|first9=J.

A.|title=Genome sequence of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum|journal=Nature|date=31 January 2002|volume=415|issue=6871|pages=497–502|doi=10.1038/415497a|pmid=11823852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on similar domain structure and repeat sequences it was presumed that this gene and homologs in other ''Ralstonia'' strains would encode proteins with the same molecular properties as TALEs, including sequence-specific DNA binding. In 2013 this was confirmed by two studies.&lt;ref name= deLange2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Schreiber|first2=Tom|last3=Schandry|first3=Niklas|last4=Radeck|first4=Jara|last5=Braun|first5=Karl Heinz|last6=Koszinowski|first6=Julia|last7=Heuer|first7=Holger|last8=Strauß|first8=Annett|last9=Lahaye|first9=Thomas|title=Breaking the DNA-binding code of                            TAL effectors provides new possibilities to generate plant resistance genes against bacterial wilt disease|journal=New Phytologist|date=August 2013|volume=199|issue=3|pages=773–786|doi=10.1111/nph.12324|pmid=23692030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Lixin|last2=Atef|first2=Ahmed|last3=Piatek|first3=Agnieszka|last4=Ali|first4=Zahir|last5=Piatek|first5=Marek|last6=Aouida|first6=Mustapha|last7=Sharakuu|first7=Altanbadralt|last8=Mahjoub|first8=Ali|last9=Wang|first9=Guangchao|last10=Khan|first10=Suhail|last11=Fedoroff|first11=Nina V.|last12=Zhu|first12=Jian-Kang|last13=Mahfouz|first13=Magdy M.|title=Characterization and DNA-Binding Specificities of Ralstonia TAL-Like Effectors|journal=Molecular Plant|date=July 2013|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1318–1330|doi=10.1093/mp/sst006|pmid=23300258|pmc=3716395}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes and the proteins they encode are referred to as RipTALs (Ralstonia injected protein TALE-like) in line with the standard nomenclature of Ralstonia effectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peeters|first1=Nemo|last2=Carrère|first2=Sébastien|last3=Anisimova|first3=Maria|last4=Plener|first4=Laure|last5=Cazalé|first5=Anne-Claire|last6=Genin|first6=Stephane|title=Repertoire, unified nomenclature and evolution of the Type III effector gene set in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=859|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-859|pmid=24314259|pmc=3878972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the DNA binding code of the core repeats is conserved with TALEs, RipTALs do not share the T-zero preference, instead they have a strict G-zero requirement.&lt;ref name=deLange2013/&gt; In addition repeats within a single RipTAL repeat array have multiple sequence differences beyond the RVD positions, unlike the near-identical repeats of TALEs.

'''Biological role'''

Several lines of evidence support the idea that RipTALs function as effector proteins, promoting bacterial growth or disease by manipulating the expression of plant genes. They are secreted into plant cells by the [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], which is the main delivery system for effector proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mukaihara|first1=Takafumi|last2=Tamura|first2=Naoyuki|last3=Iwabuchi|first3=Masaki|title=Genome-Wide Identification of a Large Repertoire of Ralstonia solanacearum Type III Effector Proteins by a New Functional Screen|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|volume=23|issue=3|pages=251–262|doi=10.1094/mpmi-23-3-0251|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-23-3-0251}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to function as sequence-specific transcription factors in plant cells.&lt;ref name=deLange2013/&gt; In addition a strain lacking its RipTAL was shown to grow slower inside eggplant leaf tissue than the wild type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macho|first1=Alberto P.|last2=Guidot|first2=Alice|last3=Barberis|first3=Patrick|last4=Beuzón|first4=Carmen R.|last5=Genin|first5=Stéphane|title=A Competitive Index Assay Identifies Several                            Type III Effector Mutant Strains with Reduced Fitness in Host Plants|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|date=September 2010|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1197–1205|doi=10.1094/MPMI-23-9-1197|url=https://zenodo.org/record/853028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study based on DNA polymorphisms in ''ripTAL'' repeat domain sequences and host plants found a statistically significant connection between host plant and repeat domain variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heuer|first1=H.|last2=Yin|first2=Y.-N.|last3=Xue|first3=Q.-Y.|last4=Smalla|first4=K.|last5=Guo|first5=J.-H.|title=Repeat Domain Diversity of avrBs3-Like Genes in Ralstonia solanacearum Strains and Association with Host Preferences in the Field|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=27 April 2007|volume=73|issue=13|pages=4379–4384|doi=10.1128/AEM.00367-07|pmid=17468277|pmc=1932761}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected if the RipTALs of different strains are adapted to target genes in specific host plants. Despite this to date no target genes have been identified for any RipTAL.

== ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes ==
'''Discovery'''

The publication of the genome of bacterial strain [[Burkholderia rhizoxinica|''Bukrholderia rhizoxinica'']] HKI 454, in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lackner|first1=Gerald|last2=Moebius|first2=Nadine|last3=Partida-Martinez|first3=Laila P|last4=Boland|first4=Sebastian|last5=Hertweck|first5=Christian|title=Evolution of an endofungal Lifestyle: Deductions from the Burkholderia rhizoxinica Genome|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=210|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-12-210|pmid=21539752|pmc=3102044}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the discovery of a set of TALE-like genes that differed considerably in nature from the TALEs and RipTALS. The proteins encoded by these genes were studied for their DNA binding properties by two groups independently and named the Bats (Burkholderia TALE-likes &lt;ref name=Batpaper2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Wolf|first2=Christina|last3=Dietze|first3=Joern|last4=Elsaesser|first4=Janett|last5=Morbitzer|first5=Robert|last6=Lahaye|first6=Thomas|title=Programmable DNA-binding proteins from Burkholderia provide a fresh perspective on the TALE-like repeat domain|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=3 May 2014|volume=42|issue=11|pages=7436–7449|doi=10.1093/nar/gku329|pmid=24792163|pmc=4066763}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or BurrH.&lt;ref name=Juillerat2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juillerat|first1=Alexandre|last2=Bertonati|first2=Claudia|last3=Dubois|first3=Gwendoline|last4=Guyot|first4=Valérie|last5=Thomas|first5=Séverine|last6=Valton|first6=Julien|last7=Beurdeley|first7=Marine|last8=Silva|first8=George H.|last9=Daboussi|first9=Fayza|last10=Duchateau|first10=Philippe|title=BurrH: a new modular DNA binding protein for genome engineering|journal=Scientific Reports|date=23 January 2014|volume=4|doi=10.1038/srep03831|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E3831J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research showed that the repeat units of the ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes bind DNA with the same code as TALEs, governed by position 13 of each repeat. There are, however, a number of differences.

'''Biological role'''

''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are composed almost entirely of repeats, lacking the large non-repetitive domains found flanking the repeats in TALEs and RpTALs. Those domains are key to the functions of TALEs and RipTALs allowing them to infiltrate the plant nucleus and turn on gene expression.  It is therefore currently unclear what the biological roles of ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are. What is clear is that they are not effector proteins secreted into plant cells to act as transcription factors, the biological role of TALEs and RipTALs. It is not unexpected that they may differ in biological roles from TALEs and RipTALs since the life style of the bacterium they derive from is very unlike that of TALE and RipTAL bearing bacteria. ''B. rhizoxinica'' is an endosymbiont, living inside a fungus, ''Rhizopus microsporus'', a plant pathogen. The same fungus is also an opportunistic human pathogen in immuno-compromised patients, but whereas ''B. rhizoxinica'' is necessary for pathogenicity on plant hosts it is irrelevant to human infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partida-Martinez|first1=Laila P.|last2=Bandemer|first2=Sabine|last3=Rüchel|first3=Reinhard|last4=Dannaoui|first4=Eric|last5=Hertweck|first5=Christian|title=Lack of evidence of endosymbiotic toxin-producing bacteria in clinical Rhizopus isolates|journal=Mycoses|date=May 2008|volume=51|issue=3|pages=266–269|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.2007.01477.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether the ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are ever secreted either into the fungus, let alone into host plants.

As noted in the publications on ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes there may be some advantages to using these proteins as a scaffold for programmable DNA-binding proteins to function as transcription factors or designer-nucleases, compared to TALEs.&lt;ref name="Batpaper2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juillerat2014" /&gt; These advantages are a shorter repeat size, more compact domain structure (no large non-repeat domains), greater repeat sequence diversity enabling the use of PCR on the genes encoding them and making them less vulnerable  to recombinatorial repeat loss. In addition Burkholderia TALE-likes have no T-zero requirement relaxing the constraints on DNA target selection. However, to  uses of Burkholderia TALE-likes as programmable DNA binding proteins have been published, outside of the original characterization publications.

'''Discovery'''

In 2007 the results of a sweep of the world's oceans by the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] were made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yooseph|first1=Shibu|last2=Sutton|first2=Granger|last3=Rusch|first3=Douglas B|last4=Halpern|first4=Aaron L|last5=Williamson|first5=Shannon J|last6=Remington|first6=Karin|last7=Eisen|first7=Jonathan A|last8=Heidelberg|first8=Karla B|last9=Manning|first9=Gerard|last10=Li|first10=Weizhong|last11=Jaroszewski|first11=Lukasz|last12=Cieplak|first12=Piotr|last13=Miller|first13=Christopher S|last14=Li|first14=Huiying|last15=Mashiyama|first15=Susan T|last16=Joachimiak|first16=Marcin P|last17=van Belle|first17=Christopher|last18=Chandonia|first18=John-Marc|last19=Soergel|first19=David A|last20=Zhai|first20=Yufeng|last21=Natarajan|first21=Kannan|last22=Lee|first22=Shaun|last23=Raphael|first23=Benjamin J|last24=Bafna|first24=Vineet|last25=Friedman|first25=Robert|last26=Brenner|first26=Steven E|last27=Godzik|first27=Adam|last28=Eisenberg|first28=David|last29=Dixon|first29=Jack E|last30=Taylor|first30=Susan S|last31=Strausberg|first31=Robert L|last32=Frazier|first32=Marvin|last33=Venter|first33=J.

These were further characterized and assessed for their DNA-binding potential in 2015.&lt;ref name = MOrTLspaper2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Wolf|first2=Christina|last3=Thiel|first3=Philipp|last4=Krüger|first4=Jens|last5=Kleusch|first5=Christian|last6=Kohlbacher|first6=Oliver|last7=Lahaye|first7=Thomas|title=DNA-binding proteins from marine bacteria expand the known sequence diversity of TALE-like repeats|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=19 October 2015|pages=gkv1053|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1053|pmid=26481363|pmc=4787788|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeat units encoded by these sequences were found to mediate DNA binding with base preference matching the TALE code, and judged likely to form structures nearly identical to Bat1 repeats based on [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. The proteins encoded by these DNA sequences were therefore designated Marine Organism TALE-likes (MOrTLs) 1 and 2.

'''Evolutionary relationship to other TALE-likes'''

Whilst repeats of MOrTL1 and 2 both conform structurally and functionally to the TALE-like norm, they differ considerably at the sequence level both from all other TALE-likes and from one another. It is not known whether they are truly homologous to the other TALE-likes, and thus constitute together with the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats a true [[Protein family|protein-family]]. Alternatively they may have evolved independently. It is particularly difficult to judge the relationship to the other TALE-likes because almost nothing is known of the organisms that MOrTL1 and MOrTL2 come from. It is known only that they were found in two separate sea-water samples from the Gulf of Mexico and are likely to be bacteria based on size-exclusion before DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=MOrTLspaper2014/&gt;

The '''timestream''' or '''time stream''' is a [[metaphor]]ical conception of [[time]] as a [[stream]], a flowing body of [[water]]. In ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'', the term is more narrowly defined as: "the series of all events from past to future, especially when conceived of as one of many such series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=%22brave+new+words%22+time+stream&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s0mfVNv0CpGTNsCVhNgN&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brave%20new%20words%22%20time%20stream&amp;f=false |chapter= Time Stream |title= Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction |editor= Jeff Prucher |location= New York |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2007 |page= 242 |ISBN= 0195305671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timestream is the normal passage or flow of [[time]] and its historical developments, within a given dimension of reality.  The concept of the time stream, and the ability to [[Time travel|travel]] within and around it, are the fundamentals of a [[Genres, subcategories and related topics to science fiction|genre]] of [[science fiction]].

This conception has been widely used in [[mythology]] and in [[fiction]].

This analogy is useful in several ways:

* Streams flow only one way. Time moves only forward.
* Streams flow constantly. Time never stops.
* People can stand in a stream, but will be pulled along by it. People exist within time, but move with it.&lt;ref&gt;Science fiction scholar [[Paul Kincaid]] comments, "The time machine allows not movement in time (we already live in time, and a novelist has always been able to set a story in any future or past era), but transposition in time." {{cite book |author= Kincaid, Paul |chapter= Time travel |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 820 |ISBN= 0-313-32950-8 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some [[physicist]]s and [[science fiction]] writers have speculated that time is branching—it branches into [[Multiverse|alternate universes]] (see [[many-worlds interpretation]]). Streams can converge and also diverge.

[[Science fiction]] scholar [[Andrew Sawyer]] writes, "The paradoxes of time &amp;mdash; do ''we'' move in time, or does ''it'' move by us? Does it exist or is it merely an illusion of our limited perception? &amp;mdash; are puzzles that exercise both physicists and philosophers..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Sawyer, Andy |authorlink= Andrew Sawyer |chapter= Time |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 818 |ISBN= 0-313-32950-8 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Brian Stableford]] writes of the historical and philosophical concepts of time (and using the terminology of "flow"): {{cquote|Like space, it is a basic aspect of experience; early philosophical treatments of the idea hesitated in a similar fashion over the question of whether time could be said to exist apart from the objects manifesting its effects. The manner of time's experience is, however, markedly different from that of space; time appears to 'flow' unidirectionally from the past into the future, bearing all existence with it, encapsulated in the momentary present.&lt;br /&gt;The controversy as to whether time's flow is the very essence of reality or a mere allusion was already sharp in Classical times, Heraclitus holding to the former view while Parmenides and Zeno were convinced of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stableford |first= Brian M. |chapter= Time |title= Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |year= 2006 |page= 529 |ISBN= 0415974607}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] was famous for a statement that has been translated in many ways, most commonly as "No man ever steps in the same river twice," which is often called his "flux [flow] doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/heraclit/#H3 |author= Graham, Daniel W. |title= Heraclitus (fl. c. 500 B.C.E.) |publisher= IEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/phil/philo/phils/heraclitus.html |author= Marvin, Chris |title= Heraclitus of Ephesus |publisher= [[Trinity College (Connecticut)]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235809/http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/phil/philo/phils/Heraclitus.html |archivedate= January 6, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/heracli.htm |author= Cohen, S.

=== [[Science fiction]] ===

''[[The Time Stream]]'', a 1946 [[science fiction]] novel by author [[John Taine]] (pseudonym of Eric Temple Bell), is the first novel to see time as a flowing stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Chalker |first=Jack L. |authorlink=Jack L. Chalker |author2=Mark Owings |title= The Science-Fantasy Publishers: A Bibliographic History, 1923-1998 |location= Westminster, MD and Baltimore |publisher= Mirage Press, Ltd. |page=125 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', in four parts, from December, 1931, to March, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?11643 |author= Anon. |title= Bibliography: The Time Stream |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction scholar [[E. F. Bleiler]] described how Taine employed the metaphor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic concept is that time is a circular stream that runs eternally, with far past blending into far future. It is possible for certain individuals to enter this stream mentally and move in either direction, although this is a dangerous venture, for they may be carried away erratically by the stream. ... In San Francisco nine associates, who have been troubled by occasional memories of [the planet] Eos, band together to explore the time stream. They live out crisis moments in both times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bleiler, Everett Franklin and Richard J. Bleiler |chapter= Story Descriptions |title= Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years: a Complete Coverage of the Genre Magazines ''Amazing'', ''Astounding'', ''Wonder'', and Others from 1926 through 1936 |location= Kent, Ohio |publisher= Kent State University Press |year= 1998 |page= 426 |ISBN= 0873386043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another mid-century novel which employed the term in its title was ''The Ship That Sailed the Time Stream'' (1965) by [[G. C. Edmondson]] (pseudonym of José Mario Garry Ordoñez Edmondson y Cotton). [[John Clute]] writes that this "and its sequel, ''To Sail the Century Sea'' (1981), are amusingly and graphically told Fantastic-Voyage tales involving a US ship and its inadvertent Time Travels. They remain his most successful books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |last1= Clute |first1= John |authorlink1=John Clute |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |title= Edmondson, G C |year= 2014 |edition= Rev., online |publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St Martin's Griffin]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fiction titles with the term include [[J. Robert King]]'s 1999 novel ''Time Streams'' ({{ISBN|0-7869-1344-4}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?51549 |author= Anon. |title= Publication Listing |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Moorcock]]'s 1993 collection ''[[A Nomad of the Time Streams]]'' ({{ISBN|1-85798-034-4}}), and Charles M. Saplak's short story "Backwater by the Time Stream" (''Manifest Destiny'' #1, Winter 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1046575 |author= Anon. |title= Bibliography: Backwater by the Time Stream |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the theme of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], in an encyclopedia article which can usefully be applied to the concept of timestreams, [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] write, &lt;blockquote&gt;"A parallel world is another universe situated 'alongside' our own, displaced from it along a spatial fourth Dimension (parallel worlds are often referred to in sf as 'other dimensions'). Although whole universes may lie parallel in this sense, most stories focus on parallel Earths. The parallel-world idea forms a useful framework for the notion of Alternate History, and is often used in this way... &lt;br /&gt;The idea that other worlds lie parallel to our own and occasionally connect with it is one of the oldest speculative ideas in literature and legend; examples range from Fairyland to the 'astral plane' of Spiritualists and mystics. There are two basic folkloristic themes connected with the notion; in one, an ordinary human is translocated into a fantasy land where s/he undergoes adventures and may find the love and fulfilment that remain beyond reach on Earth; in the other, a communication or visitation from the other world affects the life of an individual within this world, often injuring or destroying that person. Both patterns are very evident in modern imaginative fiction, shaping whole subgenres... &lt;br /&gt;A common variant of the theme is that of a multiplicity of almost-identical worlds existing in parallel: alternate worlds in which there has been no significant change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |last1= Clute |first1= John |authorlink1=John Clute |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |title= Parallel Worlds |year= 2014 |edition= Rev., online |publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St Martin's Griffin]] |location=New York |quote=  |isbn=0-312-09618-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Fantasy|Fantasy fiction]] ===
Rick Sutcliffe provides a definition in a brief essay on his own fiction: "The timestream is an alternate history device used in Rick Sutcliffe's fiction. It is the medium in which the various alternate earths exist, or, if one prefers, it provides the connections among them, in the manner of [[C. S. Lewis]]' [[Wood between the Worlds|wood between the worlds]] -- a place between."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arjay.bc.ca/Fiction/TimestreamInfo1.htm |author= Sutcliffe, Rick |date= 2013 |title= Timestream Index |publisher= Arjay Enterprises |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not discussing the timestream ''per se'', scholar [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] discusses a related topic, that of the [[time travel|time slip]]: "Generally protagonists [return] to their starting points but a frequent device is that, after repeated timeslips, the 'traveler' chooses to remain in the other period.  Generally there is an emotional or psychological connection of some kind between the character and the earlier time &amp;mdash; most often love... Unsurprisingly, timeslips are a staple of the subgenre of romance fiction called the Paranormal Romance, exemplified by Diana Gabaldson's ''Outlander'' (1991) and its sequels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Grant, John |chapter= Timeslips |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 821 |ISBN= 0-313-32950-8 |quote= A timeslip occurs when a person inadvertently, and acausally, slides from one era into another...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of the usage of timestream:

* In [[DC Comics]], the timestream is an invisible current that flows through the [[DC Universe]]. It is used as a way for heroes like the [[Linear Men (comics)|Linear Men]], and especially [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], to travel and correct time fluctuations from time traveling supervillains who seek to alter the correct reality. The timestream was mainly used by Waverider during ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'', [[Death of Superman]], and ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''  events.  The timestream is connected to the [[Speed Force]], so [[speedster (comics)|speedster]]s are able to tap into certain points in it in order to time travel.

[[File:Original Position.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Symbolic depiction of Rawls's veil of ignorance.  The citizens making the choices about their society make them from an "original position" of equality and ignorance ''(left)'', without knowing what gender, race, abilities, tastes, wealth, or position in society they will have ''(right)''.  Rawls claims this ensures they will choose a just society. ]]

The "'''veil of ignorance'''" is a method of determining the [[morality]] of political issues proposed in 1971 by American philosopher [[John Rawls]] in his "[[original position]]" [[political philosophy]]. It is based upon the following [[thought experiment]]: people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents, abilities, tastes, social class, and positions they will have within a social order. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society in which they will live, this "veil of ignorance" prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights, positions, and resources in that society. For example, for a proposed society in which 50% of the population is kept in [[slavery]], it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would be a slave. The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations, since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self- or class-interest.

As Rawls put it, "no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength, and the like".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Theory of Justice|first=John|last=Rawls|authorlink=John Rawls|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1999 | page = 118 | isbn = 0-674-00078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the thought experiment is to render obsolete those personal considerations that are morally irrelevant to the [[justice]] or injustice of principles meant to allocate the benefits of social cooperation. The veil of ignorance is part of a long tradition of thinking in terms of a [[social contract]] that includes the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]].

==The concept==
Spencer J. Maxcy outlines the concept as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine that you have set for yourself the task of developing a totally new social contract for today's society. How could you do so fairly? Although you could never actually eliminate all of your personal biases and prejudices, you would need to take steps at least to minimize them. Rawls suggests that you imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of ignorance. Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities, or your position in society. You know nothing of your sex, race, nationality, or individual tastes. Behind such a veil of ignorance all individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal beings. You do know that in the "real world", however, there will be a wide variety in the natural distribution of natural assets and abilities, and that there will be differences of sex, race, and culture that will distinguish groups of people from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEpQCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|title=Ethical School Leadership|last=Maxcy|first=Spencer J.|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that such a concept can have grand effects if it were to be practiced both in the present and in the past. Referring again to the example of slavery, if the slave-owners were forced through the veil of ignorance to imagine that they themselves may be slaves, then suddenly slavery may no longer seem justifiable. A grander example would be if each individual in society were to base their practices off the fact that they could be the least advantaged member of society. In this scenario, freedom and equality could possibly coexist in a way that has been the ideal of many philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andreaskluth.org/2009/10/28/the-veil-of-ignorance-another-great-thought-experiment|title=The veil of ignorance: great thought experiment|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the imaginary society, one might or might not be intelligent, rich, or born into a preferred class. Since one may occupy any position in the society once the veil is lifted, the device forces the parties to consider society from the perspective of all members, including the worst-off and best-off members.

==History==
The concept of the veil of ignorance has been in use by other names for centuries by philosophers such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] whose work discussed the concept of the [[social contract]]. [[John Harsanyi]] helped to formalize the concept in economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Harsanyi |title=Cardinal Utility in Welfare Economics and in the Theory of Risk-taking |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy|J. Polit. Economy]] |volume=61 |year=1953 |issue=5 |pages=434–435 |jstor=1827289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Harsanyi |title=Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility |journal=J. Polit. Economy |volume=63 |issue=4 |year=1955 |pages=309–21 |jstor=1827128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that it provides an argument in favor of [[utilitarianism]] rather than an argument for a social contract.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Samuel|title=Original Position|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=13 September 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern usage was developed by John Rawls in his 1971 book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Rawls |title=A Theory of Justice |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |year=1971 |isbn=0-674-00078-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Rawls |title=[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Belknap Press |year=2001 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zanzibar servaline genet''' (''Genetta servalina archeri'') is a recently discovered [[subspecies]] of [[servaline genet]] endemic to [[Unguja|Unguja Island]] in the [[Tanzania]]n archipelago of [[Zanzibar]]. Its conservation status is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Rompaey&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Rompaey, H.  |author2=Colyn, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = A New Servaline Genet (Carnivora, Viverridae) from Zanzibar Island | journal = South African Journal of Zoology | volume = 33 | pages = 42–46|url=http://content.ajarchive.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/00445096&amp;CISOPTR=968&amp;REC=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary history ==
The closest known relative of the Zanzibar servaline genet is [[Lowe's servaline genet]], ''G. s. lowei'', a subspecies which is found in the [[Eastern Arc Mountains]] of mainland Tanzania. These two animals have presumably been evolving independently since at least the end of the last [[ice age]], when Unguja was separated from continental [[Africa]] by rising sea levels. The survival of the servaline genet on the island parallels that of the endemic [[Zanzibar leopard]], and the [[Zanzibar red colobus]].

== Discovery and description ==

Although the servaline was known to rural Zanzibaris,&lt;ref name=Goldman2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldman, H.V., Winther-Hansen, J. &amp; Walsh, M.T. | year = 2004|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13994952/Zanzibars-Recently-Discovered-Servaline-Genet | title = Zanzibar's Recently Discovered Servaline Genet | journal = Nature East Africa | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoologists remained unaware of its existence until the last decade of the 20th century. In 1995 Tony Archer, a wildlife consultant working in Zanzibar, acquired a dried skin and skull in the village of Kitogani, in south-central Unguja. This specimen was subsequently described as a new subspecies of servaline genet (''G. s. archeri''), named in honour of Archer.&lt;ref name=Rompaey/&gt;

In January 2003 live Zanzibar servaline genets were photographed for the first time in nearby [[Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park]]. Camera traps yielded pictures of servalines at four locations, two in groundwater forest in the heart of the park and two in dry scrub to the north-east. These photographs provided new information about the distribution of the genet and its physical characteristics.&lt;ref name=Goldman2003a&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Winther-Hansen, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2003 | url = http://www.trailmaster.com/reference/ZbarCamTrap2003.pdf | title = The Small Carnivores of Unguja: Results of a Photo-trapping Survey in Jozani Forest Reserve, Zanzibar, Tanzania | accessdate = 2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldman2003b&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Winther-Hansen, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2003 | title = First Photographs of the Zanzibar Servaline Genet, ''Genetta servaline archeri'', and Other Endemic Subspecies on the Island of Unguja, Tanzania | journal = Small Carnivore Conservation | volume = 29 | pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
