[[File:AP Studio art.jpg|thumb|AP Studio Art is an advanced drawing and painting course. ]]
'''AP Studio Art''' is a series of [[Advanced Placement]] [[Course (education)|Course]]s divided into three different categories: AP Studio Art Drawing, AP Studio Art 2D Design, and AP Studio Art 3D Design.

==The portfolio==

Unlike traditional AP Exams that utilize a [[multiple-choice]] section, [[free response]] section, and occasionally an [[Audiobook|audio]] section, the AP Studio Art Exam is a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] that encompasses 3 different categories: Quality, Concentration, and Breadth.  Depending on the AP Studio Art exam the person is taking, the components for each of the 3 categories will vary.  Regardless of the exam, all AP Studio Art portfolios have to be turned in by a set date and time, for example, 12:00pm on May 11, 2007 for the 2007 exam.

==AP Studio Art Drawing==

AP Studio Art Drawing is an [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] course that deals with basic [[painting]] and [[drawing]]. Focus is applied on the [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the different [[wikt:line|line]]s/[[colors]]/[[shape]]/etc... of the painting instead of the design itself. Originally called AP Studio Art, it was later changed to AP Studio Art Drawing.

===Portfolio===

*'''Section I: Quality:''' A student submits 5 actual [[Visual arts|artwork]] to the AP College Board that represent the student's [[Quality (business)|quality]] of technique and their design concepts.
*'''Section II: Concentration:''' A student submits 12 different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to paint and draw a variety of pieces that relate to 1 idea. These are arranged in a special order on slide coverings from [[College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.
*'''Section III: Breadth:''' A student submits 12 additional and different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to incorporate [[drawing]] techniques and issues that include drawing from [[observation]], work with [[Inversive geometry|inverted]] or [[nonobjective]] [[Form (visual art)|forms]], effective use of [[light]] and [[shading|shade]], [[wikt:line|line]] quality, surface [[wikt:manipulate|manipulation]], composition, various spatial systems, and expressive mark-making.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/studioart/ap04_sg_studioart.pdf | title = AP Studio Art Scoring Guidelines | format = PDF | publisher = [[College Board]] | accessdate = 2006-05-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060421002604/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/studioart/ap04_sg_studioart.pdf| archivedate= 21 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are arranged similar to Section II.  Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.

===Grade distribution===

In the 2016 administration, 18,407 students took the exam with 21 students earning a perfect score of 72/72.

==AP Studio Art 2D==

AP Studio Art 2D is an [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] course that is similar to AP Studio Art Drawing. It deals with [[two-dimensional]] applications such as [[graphic design]], [[photography]], [[weaving]], and [[collage]]. As a contrary to AP Studio Art Drawing, focus is applied on the [[design]] itself instead of the composition of the artwork.

===Portfolio===

*'''Section I: Quality:''' A student submits 5 actual artwork that represents the student's [[Quality (business)|quality]] of designing pieces in [[2D geometric model|2D]].
*'''Section II: Concentration:''' A student submits 12 different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to make a variety of pieces in 2D that relate to 1 [[idea]]. These are arranged in a special order on slide coverings from [[College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.
*'''Section III: Breadth:''' A student submits 12 additional and different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to incorporate 2D [[Design principle]]s that include unity/variety, [[Equilibrioception|balance]], [[Cultural emphasis|emphasis]], [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[rhythm]], [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]/[[scale (ratio)|scale]], and figure-ground relationship.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; These are arranged similar to Section II. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.

===Grade distribution===

In the 2012 administration 23,591 students took the exam with a mean score of 3.28.

==AP Studio Art 3D==

AP Studio Art 3D is a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Advanced Placement]] Studio Art course that holds many similarities to the AP Studio Art 2D course. The course deals with [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] artistic applications such as [[metalworking]], [[sculpture]], [[computer model|model]], and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. Like AP Studio Art 2D, the focus on the [[design]] of the artwork itself as opposed to its composition.

===Portfolio===

*'''Section I: Quality:''' The actual work for this exam is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] and not flat, so transporting it directly to [[College Board|The College Board]] could cause damage to the artwork and the pieces would most likely not fit in portfolios. Because of this, five pieces of artwork are shown in ten slides to showcase the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of the student's [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] pieces.
*'''Section II: Concentration:''' 12 different slides are submitted to demonstrate the student's ability to produce a variety of pieces that relate to a single [[idea]]. The slides are arranged in slide coverings in an order designated by [[College Board|The College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents, and the student was allowed to determine the order of the works in their concentration.
*'''Section III: Breadth:''' Eight different works are shown in 16 slides which are meant to demonstrate the student's ability to incorporate a variety of different [[3D Design]] principles, including unity/variety, [[Equilibrioception|balance]], [[Cultural emphasis|emphasis]], [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[rhythm]], [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]/[[Scale (ratio)|scale]], and figure/ground relationship.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; Similar to Section II, this section's slides are also arranged in an order designated by [[College Board|The College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.

In [[Multi-hop routing|multi-hop networks]], '''Adaptive Quality of Service routing''' (AQoS or AQR) protocols {{Definition|date=July 2009}} have become increasingly popular and have numerous applications.  One application in which it may be useful is in [[Mobile ad hoc network]]ing (MANET). 

Adaptive QoS routing is a [[cross-layer optimization]] [[adaptive routing]] mechanism. The cross-layer mechanism provides up-to-date local QoS information for the adaptive routing algorithm, by considering the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link performance. The multiple QoS requirements are satisfied by adaptively using forward error correction and multipath routing mechanisms, based on the current network status. The complete routing mechanism includes three parts: (1) a modified dynamic source routing algorithm that handles route discovery and the collection of QoS related parameters; (2) a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node; and (3) an integrated
decision-making system to calculate the number of routing paths, coding parity length, and traffic distribution rates.

== Introduction ==
A [[wireless ad hoc network]] consists of a collection of mobile nodes interconnected by multihop wireless paths with wireless transmitters and receivers. Such networks can be spontaneously created and operated in a self-organized manner, because they do not rely upon any preexisting network infrastructure.

The emergence of multimedia applications in communications has generated the need to provide
[[mobile quality-of-service]] (QoS) support in ad hoc networks, and such applications require a stable path to guarantee QoS requirements. However, the topology of ad hoc networks is highly dynamic due to the unpredictable node mobility. In addition, wireless channel bandwidth is limited. So, QoS provisioning in such networks is complex and challenging.

QoS routing usually involves two tasks: collecting and maintaining up-to-date state information about the network and finding feasible paths for a connection based on its QoS requirements.  Many approaches currently exist to perform QoS routing, most of which consist of routing across the [[Network layer]] of the [[OSI model]] only.  Some approaches utilize both the Network and [[Data link layer]] but do not consider the cross layer behaviors.  This makes quantifying the QoS parameters difficult and leads to considerations of QoS but does not guarantee QoS.  

To address this problem, appropriate cross-layer cooperation is required.  Adaptive QoS schemes provide QoS information by factoring the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link parameters into QoS performance. 

=== Traditional QoS Approaches ===
Most QoS approaches tend to focus on only one QoS parameter (e.g., packet loss, end-to-end delay, and bandwidth). For example, while many of the QoS-related schemes are successful in reducing packet loss by adding redundancy in the packet, they do this at the expense of end-to-end delay. Because packet loss and end-to-end delay are inversely related, it may not be possible to find a path that simultaneously satisfies the delay, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints. Some proposed QoS routing algorithms do consider multiple metrics, but without considering cross-layer cooperation. Multipath routing is another type of QoS routing that has received much attention, since it can provide load balancing, fault tolerance, and higher aggregate bandwidth. Although this approach decreases packet loss and end-to-end delay, it is only efficient and reliable if a relationship can be found between the number of paths and QoS constraints.

== Adaptive QoS Scheme Overview ==
To implement an adaptive multipath routing scheme, three functions distributed in different parts of the network are needed. First, a modified dynamic source routing function is needed. It handles route discovery and collecting the local QoS-related information along the selected
routes. Second, there is a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node. This function is used to support the above routing function. It will manage
and build the local routing information in each node, which includes a QoS-related table. The third function will be in charge of the final decision-making process. The adaptive
routing parameters are derived from the decision-making algorithm based on the QoS constraints. They are the number N of selected paths, parity length k of the FEC, code and the set {R} of the traffic distribution rates on each path. With these functions, adaptive multipath QoS routing is implemented.

QoS requirements can be based on either a delay or a delay and bandwidth requirement, or a packet loss requirement. FEC parity length is derived from the difference between the QoS
delay requirement and the average delay on selected paths under the packet-loss constraint. Average packet loss under this FEC scheme is achieved by using multiple routing paths.
At the same time, the packet distribution rate on each path is determined under fair packet-loss and load-balance principles.  Routing maintenance under the same QoS guarantees
is achieved without increasing its computational complexity.This required to be understand.

== Adaptive QoS Performance ==
Three functions (routing function, local statistic computation and monitoring function, and integrated decisionmaking function) are implemented in the different parts of the mobile network. Due to the distributed structure, the computation and implementation complexity of the
routing scheme are reduced. Also, since routes are discovered based on the up-to-date local information and selected by the optimization computation, routing parameters (e.g., number of paths, FEC parity length, and traffic distribution rate) are dynamic and optimized. In addition
to supporting multiple QoS requirements, traffic balancing and bandwidth resources are factored into our decisionmaking process. The distributed structure of the local QoS statistics used in the routing enables this QoS support mechanism to be scalable in mobile networks. Simulation
results indicate that the performance (i.e., packet loss and end-to-end delay) are much better and less susceptible to the state changes (i.e., node mobility, transmission power, channel characteristics, and the traffic pattern) of the network, compared to a nonadaptive routing strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11616">'''Agroecosystem analysis''' is a thorough analysis of an [[agricultural]] environment which considers aspects from [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[politics]] with equal weight. There are many aspects to consider; however, it is literally impossible to account for all of them. This is one of the issues when trying to conduct an analysis of an agricultural environment. In the past, an agroecosystem analysis approach might be used to determine the [[sustainability]] of an agricultural system. It has become apparent, however, that the "sustainability" of the system depends heavily on the definition of sustainability chosen by the observer. Therefore, agroecosystem analysis is used to bring the richness of the true complexity of agricultural systems to an analysis to identify reconfigurations of the system (or ''holon'') that will best suit individual situations.

[[Agroecosystem]] analysis is a tool of the multidisciplinary subject known as [[Agroecology]]. Agroecology and agroecosystem analysis are not the same as [[sustainable agriculture]], though the use of agroecosystem analysis may help a farming system ensure its viability. Agroecosystem analysis is not a new practice, [[agriculturalists]] and [[farmers]] have been doing it since societies switched from hunting and gathering ([[hunter-gatherer]]) for food to settling in one area. Every time a person involved in agriculture evaluates their situation to identify methods to make the system function in a way that better suits their interests, they are performing an agroecosystem analysis.

== Agroecosystem analysis and sustainable agriculture differ ==

It is difficult to discuss these differences without the aid of an example. Consider the case of a conventional (see [[conventional agriculture]]) apple farmer. This farmer may choose to change his farm to conform to the standards of [[USDA]] approved [[organic agriculture]] because he felt motivated by social or moral norms or the potential of increased profits or a host of other reasons. This farmer evaluated his situation and reconfigured it to try to improve it. Some might look at this situation and conclude that the apple farmer chose organic apple production because it is more sustainable for the environment. But, what if a few years later the farmer finds that he is struggling to make a profit and decides to go back to conventional agriculture?  The farmer performed another agroecosystem analysis and arrived at a reconfiguration that some might see as unsustainable. This example illustrates how agroecosystem analysis is not required to lead a more environmentally sustainable form of agriculture. Agroecosystem analysis might produce a reconfiguration that is more economically sustainable or socially sustainable or politically sustainable for a farmer (or other actor). By definition, however, agroecosystem analysis is not required to produce an environmentally sustainable configuration for an agricultural system.

== Approach to analysis ==

William L. Bland, from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], developed the idea of a farm as a [[Holon (philosophy)]] This term, ''holon'', was originally introduced by [[Arthur Koestler]] in 1966, in which he referred to a ''holon'' as an entity in which it is a part by itself, a ''holon'', while contributing to a larger entity, which is also a ''holon''.&lt;ref&gt;* Koestler, Arthur, 1967. ''The Ghost in the Machine''. London: Hutchinson. 1990 reprint edition, Penguin Group. {{ISBN|0-14-019192-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bland develops this for an agricultural environment or [[farm]] as, "The farm holon is both the whole in which smaller holons exists, and a part of larger entities, themselves holons." This idea was expanded upon by Bland and Michael M. Bell [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in their 2007 article "A holon approach to agroecology,"&lt;ref&gt;*Bland, W.L. and Bell, M.M., (2007) A holon approach to agroecology ''International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability'' 5(4), 280-294. [http://www.drs.wisc.edu/documents/articles/bell/bland-bell-2007.pdf abstract available here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051309/http://www.drs.wisc.edu/documents/articles/bell/bland-bell-2007.pdf |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is difficult to account for boundary and change when using a [[systems thinking]] approach. One major difference between Koestler's holon and the holon idea developed for agroecosystem analysis is that the latter can only be defined as a holon if it has [[intentionality]].

The farm itself is a holon and within the [[farm]] holon, other holons exist. For example, a [[Livestock|farm animal]], the farm [[family]], and a [[farmworker]] can all be considered holons within the farm. Additionally, the farm is considered a holon which is inpart connected to other holons such as the [[county]] in which the farm resides, the [[bank]] from which the [[farmer]] borrowed money, or the [[grain elevator]] where the farmer can sell goods. Things like the [[tractor]] or the [[barn]] are not holons because they lack [[intentionality]].

When conducting an agroecosystem analysis, the analyst should approach the farm as the farm itself and the "[[ecology of contexts]]" in which the farm and the farmer function. A "context" is anything that might influence functioning of the farm and cause it to change. According to Bland and Bell, examples of contexts include, "family, farm business, genetic heart disease, and spiritual beliefs." These examples illustrate the breadth of contexts that could influence why farmers do what they do. Bland concluded his model of a [[farm]] as a ''holon'' by stating, "A farm is not [[sustainable]] (disintegrates) when it cannot find an overall configuration that is simultaneously viable in all contexts."

==Questions to consider==

There is no right or wrong way to evaluate an agroecosystem. It is important to identify all actors in a holon before beginning the analysis. When an analyst accepts the task of analyzing the agroecosystem, first and foremost, it must be approached as to incorporate all elements involved and should derive questions that should be answered. Questions such as:

*What defining factors (holons and contexts) determine the present configuration of the agroecosystem?
*How does one quantify the sustainability of the farm holon (economic, social, political, ecological and/or other)?
*How does the farmer or farm family perceive an agroecosystem?
*What is the farmer doing now, and how do those practices or actions affect the viability of the agroecosystem?
*Can the farmer maintain his livelihood continuing with current practices?
*What does the farmer value and where do those values come from?
*Will the farmer consider alternative farm configurations?

These are the types of questions an analyst could consider. There are no preset questions to ask, and usually more questions are derived than answered. However, the most important task an analysts can do, is to start the analysis with an open mind and under no presumptions about what is and is not sustainable for the farm holon.

== Analysis types ==

J. Visser of [[Dordt College]] uses a diagram, "Wealth Creation Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;*[http://cari.unl.edu/Presentations/wealthwheel.pdf Wealth Creation Wheel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907235848/http://cari.unl.edu/Presentations/wealthwheel.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to emphasize and account for the parameters of developing a thorough analysis. His diagram is more emphasized on [[economics]]; however, it is a useful tool to reference when starting to analyze an agroecoystem. His interest is to create a functioning wheel which will ''roll'' when all parameters are met equally. If one parameter is not functioning in context with the other parameters, then the wheel will be out of balance and ineffective, thus unsustainable. When referring to an [[agroecosystem]], if one parameter is out of balance, this could lead to an unproductive cropping season and loss of income and/or livelihood.

An '''air preheater''' (APH) is any device designed to heat [[air]] before another process (for example,  [[combustion]] in a [[boiler]]) with the primary objective of increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. They may be used alone or to replace a [[recuperator|recuperative]] heat system or to replace a steam coil.

In particular, this article describes the combustion air preheaters used in large [[boilers]] found in [[thermal power station]]s producing [[electric power]] from e.g. [[fossil fuel power plant|fossil fuels]], [[biomass]] or [[incinerator|waste]].&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sadik Kakaç |author2=Hongtan Liu |title=Heat Exchangers: Selection, Rating and Thermal Design|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8493-0902-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite book|author =Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sadik&gt;{{cite book|author =Sadik Kakaç (Editor)|title=Boilers. Evaporators and Condensers|edition= |publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=April 1991|isbn=0-471-62170-6}} (See Chapter 8 by Z.H.

Elliott |author2=Kao Chen |author3=Robert Swanekamp |title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the air preheater is to recover the heat from the boiler [[flue gas]] which increases the thermal efficiency of the boiler by reducing the useful heat lost in the flue gas. As a consequence, the flue gases are also conveyed to the [[flue gas stack]] (or [[chimney]]) at a lower temperature, allowing simplified design of the conveyance system and the flue gas stack. It also allows control over the temperature of gases leaving the stack (to meet emissions regulations, for example).It is installed between the economizer and chimney.

==Types==
There are two types of air preheaters for use in steam generators in [[thermal power station]]s: One is a tubular type built into the boiler flue gas ducting, and the other is a [[regenerative heat exchanger|regenerative]] air preheater.&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airpreheatercompany.com/Products/Category.aspx?cat=1&amp;subcat=12 |title=Trisector Ljungström Air Preheater |access-date=2007-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131420/http://www.airpreheatercompany.com/Products/Category.aspx?cat=1&amp;subcat=12 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be arranged so the gas flows horizontally or vertically across the axis of rotation.

Another type of air preheater is the ''regenerator'' used in iron or glass manufacture.

===Tubular type===

====Construction features====
Tubular preheaters consist of straight [[cylinder (geometry)|tube]] bundles which pass through the outlet ducting of the boiler and open at each end outside of the ducting. Inside the ducting, the hot furnace gases pass around the preheater tubes, transferring heat from the exhaust gas to the air inside the preheater. Ambient air is forced by a fan through ducting at one end of the preheater tubes and at other end the heated air from inside of the tubes emerges into another set of ducting, which carries it to the boiler furnace for combustion.

====Problems====
The tubular preheater ductings for cold and hot air require more space and structural supports than a rotating preheater design. Further, due to dust-laden abrasive flue gases, the tubes outside the ducting wear out faster on the side facing the gas current. Many advances have been made to eliminate this problem such as the use of ceramic and hardened steel.

Many new [[Fluidized bed combustion|circulating fluidized bed]] (CFB) and [[Fluidized bed combustion|bubbling fluidized bed]] (BFB) steam generators are currently incorporating tubular air heaters offering an advantage with regards to the moving parts of a rotary type.

=====Dew point corrosion=====
[[Dew point]] corrosion occurs for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmsinc.us/ Examples of dewpoint corrosion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmsinc.us/ More examples of dewpoint corrosion]&lt;/ref&gt; The type of fuel used, its sulfur content and moisture content are contributing factors. However, by far the most significant cause of dew point corrosion is the metal temperature of the tubes. If the metal temperature within the tubes drops below the acid saturation temperature, usually at between 190&amp;nbsp;°F (88&amp;nbsp;°C)and 230&amp;nbsp;°F (110&amp;nbsp;°C), but sometimes at temperatures as high as 260&amp;nbsp;°F (127&amp;nbsp;°C), then the risk of dew point corrosion damage becomes considerable.

=== Regenerative air preheaters ===
There are two types of [[regenerative heat exchanger|regenerative]] air preheaters: the rotating-plate regenerative air preheaters (RAPH) and the stationary-plate regenerative air preheaters (Rothemuhle).&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sadik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors =Lawrence Drbak, Patrica Boston, Kalya Westra, and R. Bruce Erickson (Editors)|title=Power Plant Engineering (Black and Veatch)|edition=|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=1996|isbn=0-412-06401-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rotating-plate regenerative air preheater====
[[File:Rotating Air Preheater.PNG|thumb|325px|right|Typical Rotating-plate Regenerative Air Preheater (Bi-sector type)&lt;ref&gt;[http://yosemite.epa.gov/oaqps/EOGtrain.nsf/fabbfcfe2fc93dac85256afe00483cc4/0747540cee26044285256db900597c4c/$FILE/SI%20428A_1.pdf Course SI:428A] Online publication of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Air Pollution Training Institute, known as APTI (Scroll down to page 23 of 28)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Ljungström regenerative heat exchanger.jpg|thumb|325px|Principle function for the [[Fredrik Ljungström]] regenerative preheater.]]

The rotating-plate design (RAPH)&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; consists of a central rotating-plate element installed within a casing that is divided into two (''bi-sector'' type), three (''tri-sector'' type) or four (''quad-sector'' type) sectors containing seals around the element. The seals allow the element to rotate through all the sectors, but keep gas leakage between sectors to a minimum while providing separate gas air and [[flue gas]] paths through each sector.

Tri-sector types are the most common in modern power generation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bwe.dk/pdf/brochure-01%20APH_06.pdf Air preheaters: Rotating regenerative heat exchangers]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tri-sector design, the largest sector (usually spanning about half the cross-section of the casing) is connected to the boiler hot gas outlet. The hot exhaust gas flows over the central element, transferring some of its heat to the element, and is then ducted away for further treatment in [[dust collector]]s and other equipment before being expelled from the [[flue gas stack]].  The second, smaller sector, is fed with ambient air by a [[Centrifugal fan|fan]], which passes over the heated element as it rotates into the sector, and is heated before being carried to the boiler furnace for combustion. The third sector is the smallest one and it heats air which is routed into the [[pulverizer]]s and used to carry the coal-air mixture to coal boiler burners. Thus, the total air heated in the RAPH provides: heating air to remove the moisture from the pulverised coal dust, carrier air for transporting the pulverised coal to the boiler burners and the primary air for combustion.
 
The [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor]] itself is the medium of [[heat transfer]] in this system, and is usually composed of some form of steel and/or [[ceramic]] structure. It rotates quite slowly (around 1-2 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) to allow optimum heat transfer first from the hot exhaust gases to the element, then as it rotates, from the element to the cooler air in the other sectors.

=====Construction features=====
In this design the whole air preheater casing is supported on the boiler supporting structure itself with necessary [[expansion joint]]s in the ducting.

The vertical rotor is supported on thrust bearings at the lower end and has an oil bath lubrication, cooled by water circulating in coils inside the oil bath. This arrangement is for cooling the lower end of the shaft, as this end of the vertical rotor is on the hot end of the ducting. The top end of the rotor has a simple roller bearing to hold the shaft in a vertical position.

The rotor is built up on the vertical shaft with radial supports and cages for holding the baskets in position. Radial and circumferential seal plates are also provided to avoid leakages of gases or air between the sectors or between the duct and the casing while in rotation.

For on line cleaning of the deposits from the baskets steam jets are provided such that the blown out dust and ash are collected at the bottom ash hopper of the air preheater. This dust hopper is connected for emptying along with the main dust hoppers of the dust collectors.

The rotor is turned by an air driven motor and gearing, and is required to be started before starting the boiler and also to be kept in rotation for some time after the boiler is stopped, to avoid uneven expansion and contraction resulting in warping or cracking of the rotor. The station air is generally totally dry (dry air is required for the instrumentation), so the air used to drive the rotor is injected with oil to lubricate the air motor.

Safety protected inspection windows are provided for viewing the preheater's internal operation under all operating conditions.

The baskets are in the sector housings provided on the rotor and are renewable. The life of the baskets depend on the ash abrasiveness and corrosiveness of the boiler outlet gases.

=====Problems=====
The boiler flue gas contains many dust particles (due to high ash content) not contributing towards combustion, such as silica, which cause abrasive wear of the baskets, and may also contain corrosive gases depending on the composition of the fuel. For example, [[India]]n coals generally result in high levels of [[Fly ash|ash]] and [[silica]] in the flue gas. The wear of the baskets therefore is generally more than other, cleaner-burning fuels.

In this RAPH, the dust laden, corrosive boiler gases have to pass between the elements of air preheater baskets. The elements are made up of zig zag corrugated plates pressed into a steel basket giving sufficient annular space in between for the gas to pass through. These plates are corrugated to give more surface area for the heat to be absorbed and also to give it the rigidity for stacking them into the baskets. Hence frequent replacements are called for and new baskets are always kept ready. In the early days, [[Cor-ten]] steel was being used for the elements. Today due to technological advance many manufacturers may use their own patents.
Some manufacturers supply different materials for the use of the elements to lengthen the life of the baskets.

In certain cases the unburnt deposits may occur on the air preheater elements causing it to catch fire during normal operations of the boiler, giving rise to explosions inside the air preheater. Sometimes mild explosions may be detected in the [[control room]] by variations in the inlet and outlet temperatures of the combustion air.

[[Image:Stationary Plate Air Preheater.png|thumb|right|266px|Schematic of typical stationary-plate regenerative air preheater]]

====Stationary-plate regenerative air preheater====
The heating plate elements in this type of regenerative air preheater are also installed in a casing, but the heating plate  elements are stationary rather than rotating. Instead the air ducts in the preheater are rotated so as to alternatively expose sections of the heating plate elements to the upflowing cool air.&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sadik/&gt;

As indicated in the adjacent drawing, there are rotating inlet air ducts at the bottom of the stationary plates similar to the rotating outlet air ducts at the top of the stationary plates.

Stationary-plate regenerative air preheaters are also known as Rothemuhle preheaters, manufactured for over 25 years by Balke-Dürr GmbH of [[Ratingen]], [[Germany]].

===Regenerator===
{{main|Regenerative heat exchanger}}
A [[regenerative heat exchanger|regenerator]] consists of a brick checkerwork: bricks laid with spaces equivalent to a brick's width between them, so that air can flow relatively easily through the checkerwork. The idea is that as hot exhaust gases flow through the checkerwork, they give up heat to the bricks. The airflow is then reversed, so that the hot bricks heat up the incoming combustion air and fuel. For a glass-melting furnace, a regenerator sits on either side of the furnace, often forming an integral whole. For a [[blast furnace]], the regenerators (commonly called '''Cowper stoves''') sit separate to the furnace. A furnace needs no less than two stoves, but may have three. One of the stoves is 'on gas', receiving hot gases from the furnace top and heating the checkerwork inside, whilst the other is 'on blast', receiving cold air from the blowers, heating it and passing it to the blast furnace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18974">{{about|attenuation in physics|other uses|Attenuation (disambiguation)}}

In [[physics]], '''attenuation''' or, in some contexts, '''extinction''' is the gradual loss of [[flux]] intensity through a [[Transmission medium|medium]]. For instance, dark [[glasses]] attenuate [[sunlight]], [[lead]] attenuates [[X-ray]]s, and [[water]] and [[air]] attenuate both [[light]] and [[sound]] at variable attenuation rates.

[[Hearing protectors]] help reduce [[Sound power|acoustic flux]] from flowing into the ears. This phenomenon is called [[acoustic attenuation]] and is measured in [[decibel]]s (dBs).

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[telecommunication]]s, attenuation affects the [[Wave propagation|propagation of waves]] and [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] in [[electrical circuit]]s, in [[optical fiber]]s, and in air. [[Attenuator (electronics)|Electrical attenuator]]s and [[optical attenuator]]s are commonly manufactured components in this field.

== Background ==
[[Image:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|Frequency-dependent attenuation of electromagnetic radiation in standard atmosphere.]]
In many cases, attenuation is an [[exponential function]] of the path length through the medium. In chemical [[spectroscopy]], this is known as the [[Beer–Lambert law]]. In engineering, attenuation is usually measured in units of [[decibel]]s per unit length of medium (dB/cm, dB/km, etc.) and is represented by the attenuation [[coefficient]] of the medium in question.&lt;ref name=Zagzebski&gt;Essentials of Ultrasound Physics, James A. Zagzebski, Mosby Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Attenuation also occurs in [[earthquake]]s; when the [[seismic waves]] move farther away from the [[hypocenter]], they grow smaller as they are attenuated by the [[Earth|ground]].

==Ultrasound==
{{main|Acoustic attenuation}}
One area of research in which attenuation plays a prominent role, is in [[ultrasound]] physics. Attenuation in ultrasound is the reduction in amplitude of the ultrasound beam as a function of distance through the imaging medium. Accounting for attenuation effects in ultrasound is important because a reduced signal amplitude can affect the quality of the image produced. By knowing the attenuation that an ultrasound beam experiences traveling through a medium, one can adjust the input signal amplitude to compensate for any loss of energy at the desired imaging depth.&lt;ref name="Bushong"&gt;Diagnostic Ultrasound, Stewart C. Bushong and Benjamin R. Archer, Mosby Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ultrasound attenuation'' measurement in [[heterogeneous]] systems, like [[emulsion]]s or [[colloid]]s, yields information on [[particle size distribution]]. There is an ISO standard on this technique.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 20998-1:2006 "Measurement and characterization of particles by acoustic methods"&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ultrasound attenuation'' can be used for [[extensional rheology]] measurement. There are [[acoustic rheometer]]s that employ [[Stokes' law of sound attenuation|Stokes' law]] for measuring [[extensional viscosity]] and [[volume viscosity]].

Wave equations which take acoustic attenuation into account can be written on a fractional derivative form, see the article on [[acoustic attenuation]] or e.g. the survey paper.&lt;ref name="Nasholm"&gt;S. P. Näsholm and S. Holm, "On a Fractional Zener Elastic Wave Equation," Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal. Vol. 16, No 1 (2013), pp. 26–50, {{doi|10.2478/s13540-013--0003-1}} [https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4024 Link to e-print]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attenuation coefficient===
{{Main|Attenuation coefficient}}
[[Attenuation coefficient]]s are used to quantify different media according to how strongly the transmitted ultrasound amplitude decreases as a function of frequency. The attenuation [[coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) can be used to determine total attenuation in [[decibel|dB]] in the medium using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Attenuation} = \alpha [\text{dB}/(\text{MHz} \cdot \text{cm})] \cdot \ell [\text{cm}] \cdot \text{f}[\text{MHz}]&lt;/math&gt;

Attenuation is linearly dependent on the medium length and attenuation coefficient, and also –approximately– on the [[frequency]] of the incident ultrasound beam for biological tissue
(while for simpler media, such as air, the relationship is [[ Stokes's_law_of_sound_attenuation| quadratic]]). Attenuation coefficients vary widely for different media. In biomedical ultrasound imaging however, biological materials and water are the most commonly used media. The attenuation coefficients of common biological materials at a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz are listed below:&lt;ref name="Culjat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culjat |first1=Martin O. |last2=Goldenberg |first2=David |last3=Tewari |first3=Priyamvada |last4=Singh |first4=Rahul S. |year=2010 |title=A Review of Tissue Substitutes for Ultrasound Imaging |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology |volume=36 |pmid=20510184 |issue=6 |pages=861–873 |url=http://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(10)00075-X |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416030037/http://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(10)00075-X |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.02.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two general ways of acoustic energy losses: [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]] and [[scattering]], for instance [[light scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;Bohren, C. F. and Huffman, D.R. "Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Particles", Wiley, (1983), {{ISBN|0-471-29340-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound propagation through [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] media is associated only with absorption and can be characterized with [[absorption coefficient]] only. Propagation through [[heterogeneous]] media requires taking into account scattering.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. "Ultrasound for characterizing colloids", Elsevier, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Fractional derivative wave equations can be applied for modeling of lossy acoustical wave propagation, see also [[acoustic attenuation]] and Ref.&lt;ref name="Nasholm"/&gt;

==Light attenuation in water==
[[Shortwave radiation]] emitted from the sun have wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]] of light that range from 360&amp;nbsp;nm (violet) to 750&amp;nbsp;nm (red). When the sun's radiation reaches the sea-surface, the shortwave radiation is attenuated by the water, and the intensity of light decreases exponentially with water depth.  The intensity of light at depth can be calculated using the [[Beer-Lambert Law]].

In clear open waters, visible light is absorbed at the longest wavelengths first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths are absorbed at higher water depths, and blue and violet wavelengths reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths are absorbed last compared to the other wavelengths, open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.

In near-shore (coastal) waters, sea water contains more [[phytoplankton]] than the very clear central ocean waters. [[Chlorophyll]]-a pigments in the phytoplankton absorb light, and the plants themselves scatter light, making coastal waters less clear than open waters. Chlorophyll-a absorbs light most strongly in the shortest wavelengths (blue and violet) of the visible spectrum. In near-shore waters where there are high concentrations of phytoplankton, the green wavelength reaches the deepest in the water column and the color of water to an observer appears green-blue or green.

==Seismic waves==
The energy with which an [[earthquake]] affects a location depends on the running [[distance]]. The attenuation in the signal of ground motion intensity plays an important role in the assessment of possible strong groundshaking. A [[seismic wave]] loses [[energy]] as it propagates through the [[earth]] (attenuation). This [[phenomenon]] is tied into the [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] of the seismic energy with the distance. There are two types of [[Dissipation|dissipated]] energy:

* geometric dispersion caused by distribution of the seismic energy to greater volumes
* dispersion as heat, also called intrinsic attenuation or anelastic attenuation.

==Electromagnetic==
Attenuation decreases the intensity of [[electromagnetic radiation]] due to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[scattering]] of [[photon]]s.  Attenuation does not include the decrease in intensity due to [[inverse-square law]] geometric spreading.  Therefore, calculation of the total change in intensity involves both the inverse-square law and an estimation of attenuation over the path.

The primary causes of attenuation in matter are the [[photoelectric effect]], [[compton scattering]], and, for photon energies of above 1.022 MeV, [[pair production]].

===Radiography===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}

The beam of X-ray is attenuated when photons are absorbed when the x-ray beam passes through the tissue. Interaction with matter varies between high energy photons and low energy photons. Photons travelling at higher energy are more capable of travelling through a tissue specimen as they have less chances of interacting with matter. This is mainly due to the photoelectric effect which states that "the probability of photoelectric absorption is approximately proportional to (Z/E)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where Z is the atomic number of the tissue atom and E is the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xrayphysics.com/attenuation.html|title=X-Ray Physics: X-Ray Interaction with Matter, X-Ray Contrast, and Dose - XRayPhysics|website=xrayphysics.com|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context of this, an increase in photon energy (E) will result in a rapid decrease in the interaction with matter.

===Optics===
{{main|Transparent materials}}

Attenuation in [[fiber optics]], also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance travelled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is typically a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.
Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].&lt;ref name="Vardeny"&gt;Telecommunications: A Boost for Fibre Optics, Z. Valy Vardeny, Nature 416, 489–491, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attenuation in fiber optics can be quantified using the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://floti.bell.ac.uk/MATHSPHYSICS/5attenua.htm
 |title=Fibre Optics|publisher=Bell College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224231950/http://floti.bell.ac.uk/MATHSPHYSICS/5attenua.htm |archivedate = 2006-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{Attenuation (dB)} = 10\times\log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{Input intensity (W)}}{\text{Output intensity (W)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Light scattering ====
[[Image:Reflection angles.svg|frame|Specular reflection]]
[[Image:Diffuse reflection.PNG|thumb|right|Diffuse reflection]]
The propagation of light through the core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level of the glass, can cause light rays to be reflected in many random directions. This type of reflection is referred to as "[[diffuse reflection]]", and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles. Most objects that can be seen with the naked eye are visible due to diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is "[[light scattering]]". Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.
&lt;ref name="z"&gt;{{cite journal

|title=The Scattering of Light (Academic, New York)
|year=1909
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Light scattering from many common surfaces can be modelled by [[lambertian reflectance]].

Light scattering depends on the [[wavelength]] of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident lightwave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific microstructural feature. For example, since [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] has a wavelength scale on the order of one [[micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter), scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.

Thus, attenuation results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at internal [[Interface (matter)|surface]]s and [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]s. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that, when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of [[transparent materials|transparent ceramic materials]].

Likewise, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular-level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, "domains" exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building-blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are microstructural defects that will provide the most ideal locations for the occurrence of light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, P.S. and Bennett, H.E., "Scattering from infrared missile domes", Opt. Engr., Vol. 17, p.647 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UV-Vis-IR absorption ====
In addition to light scattering, attenuation or signal loss can also occur due to selective absorption of specific wavelengths, in a manner similar to that responsible for the appearance of color. Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:

* At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or "quantized") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.
* At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.

The selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integral multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.

===Applications===
In [[optical fiber]]s, attenuation is the rate at which the signal light decreases in intensity.  For this reason, glass fiber (which has a low attenuation) is used for long-distance fiber optic cables; plastic fiber has a higher attenuation and, hence, shorter range.  There also exist [[optical attenuator]]s that decrease the signal in a fiber optic cable intentionally.

Attenuation of light is also important in [[physical oceanography]].  This same effect is an important consideration in [[weather radar#Attenuation|weather radar]], as raindrops absorb a part of the emitted beam that is more or less significant, depending on the wavelength used.

Due to the damaging effects of high-energy photons, it is necessary to know how much energy is deposited in tissue during diagnostic treatments involving such radiation. In addition, gamma radiation is used in [[cancer treatments]] where it is important to know how much energy will be deposited in healthy and in tumorous tissue.

===Radio===
{{main|Path loss}}
Attenuation is an important consideration in the modern world of wireless [[telecommunication]].  Attenuation limits the range of radio signals and is affected by the materials a signal must travel through (e.g., air, wood, concrete, rain).  See the article on [[path loss]] for more information on signal loss in wireless communication.

== Early life and business ==
Tek was born in [[Jakarta]] and grew up in [[Singapore]]. He became a successful entrepreneur and was president/director of Indonesia-based PT Sierad Produce Tbk, with interests in poultry production through to restaurant management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://international.binus.ac.id/rnd/2007/12/23/case-study-debt-restructure-a-financial-turnaround-of-pt-sierad-produce-tbk/|title=[Case Study] Debt Restructure: A Financial Turnaround  of PT Sierad Produce.

Thailand's labor law sparks concersn of costly business|website=www.readabstracts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yuz collection ==
In 2004, Tek began collecting artworks, amassing a collection of over 1,500 pieces, the Yuz Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artreview.com/power_100/budi_tek/|title=Budi Tek / Power 100 / ArtReview|last=name|first=Site|website=artreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Invited by London's [[Tate]] to sit on its Asia Pacific Acquisitions Committee to raise awareness of Asia Pacific arts, Tek expanded the scope of his interests beyond Asian art to include Western art, acquiring works by artists such as [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Anselm Kiefer]] and [[Adel Abdessemed]] to his collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artcollector.net.au/RemarkablecollectorsphilanthropistsBudiTek|title=Remarkable collectors &amp; philanthropists: Budi Tek - Art Collector|website=www.artcollector.net.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has made a name for collecting large and difficult to display 'mega art' works, including a tigerskin made of 600,000 cigarettes, a high pressure fire hose which whips around in a purpose-built room,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/budi-tek/|title=Budi Tek in Conversation {{!}} Ocula|date=2018-11-25|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Random International]]'s ''[[Rain Room]]'', a computer-controlled indoor rain shower which remains dry around visitors walking through the deluge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peninsula.com/en/shanghai/our-city/pencities/content-calendar/everything-or-nothing|title=Everything or Nothing {{!}} The Peninsula Shanghai|website=www.peninsula.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he announced plans to house the Yuz Collection in [[Bali]], including a super-sized 150-metre square version of ''Rain Room'', but the plan was shelved due to his ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/budi-tek-presses-china-to-make-his-yuz-museum-public|title=Budi Tek presses China to make his Yuz Museum public|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yuz Foundation ==
Tek founded the Yuz Foundation in 2007. It is the umbrella organization of the Yuz Collection and the Yuz Museum. The Yuz Museum was established in Jakarta&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/arts/16iht-rartjessop16.html|title=Chinese-Indonesian Collector Makes Up for Lost Time|last=Kolesnikov-Jessop|first=Sonia|date=15 March 2012|work=New York Times|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by Shanghai, which opened in May 2014, is a non-profit museum of contemporary art, located in the core area of Shanghai West Bund. The museum was launched with the aim of establishing itself as a new landmark for exhibiting contemporary Chinese art and to be a preeminent contemporary art museum in the world. Since its opening, it has staged exhibitions by [[Yang Fudong]], Huang Yuxing, Liu Shiyuan, Random International, [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]] since its opening in May 2014.

Designed by Japanese Architect [[Sou Fujimoto]] and built on the old site of the aircraft hangar of the former [[Shanghai Longhua Airport|Long Hua Airport]], the museum boasts a total area of 9,000 square meters, among which the hangar-converted great hall alone covers over 3,000 square meters, complementing the numerous large-scale art installations, while the other galleries offer more than 1,000 square meters for paintings, sculptures and photography of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yuzmshanghai.org/about-yuz-foundationyuz-museum-and-the-founder-budi-tek/|title=About Yuz Foundation/Yuz Museum and the founder Budi Tek - Yuz Museum Shanghai|work=Yuz Museum Shanghai|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Tek was voted eighth on [[Art+Auction|Art&amp;Auction]]’s list of the top 10 most influential figures in the art world. He was also listed by ''[[Business Insider]]'' as one of the 12 most influential art collectors in the world in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/most-powerful-art-collectors-2011-12#budi-tek-9|title=Now Meet The 12 Most Powerful Art Collectors In The World|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013 he was conferred the [[Legion of Honour|French Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artasiapacific.com/Blog/LegaciesProfileOfBudiTek|title=ArtAsiaPacific: Legacies Profile Of Budi Tek|website=artasiapacific.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joint foundation with LACMA ==
Tek compared his 2018 partnership with LACMA, two years in the making, to a marriage. The move will see most of the Yuz Collection donated to a new, jointly-owned foundation. The [[University of Chicago]] art history professor Wu Hung will oversee the programme as consulting artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/budi-tek-reveals-landmark-deal-with-lacma-to-preserve-his-collection|title=Budi Tek reveals landmark deal with Lacma to preserve his collection|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move will significantly expand LACMA's holding of contemporary Chinese art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/28/lacma-yuz-museum-will-partner-exhibitions-programming/|title=In Historic U.S.-China Partnership, Budi Tek’s Shanghai-Based Yuz Museum Will Partner With LACMA|last=Binlot|first=Ann|date=2018-03-28|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed attempts by Tek to convince the Chinese government to establish a special status for the Yuz Museum, which would have created a China-based NGO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/budi-tek-presses-china-to-make-his-yuz-museum-public|title=Budi Tek presses China to make his Yuz Museum public|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Announcing the foundation, speaking remotely to an audience in Hong Kong, Tek spoke of his desire to establish his legacy: "For the last two years, not only, I used to say that was always on my mind—the second thing on my mind—is always how my legacy will be preserved for the benefit of the world [and] the glory of my God, because I am a Christian. So, this is the second thing that I need to do in my life, actually."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://museumnetwork.sothebys.com/en/articles/museum-directors-discuss-the-future-of-museums|title=Museum Directors Discuss the Future of Museums|date=2018-04-23|work=Museum Network|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bukkake videos are a relatively prevalent niche in contemporary pornographic films. Originating in Japan in the 1980s, the genre subsequently spread to North America and Europe, and crossed over into [[gay pornography]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Bukkake udon tent.jpg|thumb|right|In Japanese, the word ''bukkake'' has extensive non-sexual use, such as this food tent advertising [[bukkake udon]] noodles.]]

Bukkake is the noun form of the Japanese verb ''bukkakeru'' (ぶっ掛ける, to dash or sprinkle water),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/744/The%20(Almost)%20Complete%20Japanzine%20Dictionary%20of%20Japan%20Sex |title=The (Almost) Complete Japanzine Dictionary of Japan Sex |work=seekjapan.jp |accessdate=3 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202033818/http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/744/The%2B%28Almost%29%2BComplete%2BJapanzine%2BDictionary%2Bof%2BJapan%2BSex |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and means "to dash", "splash", or "heavy splash".&lt;ref name=Routledge /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle201077"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Moore | first1 = Lisa Jean | last2 = Weissbein | first2 = Julianna | author-link1 = Lisa Jean Moore | contribution = Cocktail parties: fetishizing semen in pornography beyond bukkake | editor-last = Boyle | editor-first = Karen | editor-link = Karen Boyle | title = Everyday pornography | page = 77 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780415543781 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8yznvRX-hfAC&amp;pg=PA77 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; The compound verb can be decomposed into a prefix and a verb: ''butsu'' (ぶつ) and ''kakeru'' (掛ける). ''Butsu'' is a prefix derived from the verb "buchi", which literally means to hit, but the usage of the prefix is a verb-intensifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ぶち【打ち】 |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E3%81%B6%E3%81%A1&amp;dtype=0&amp;stype=0&amp;dname=0na&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=18773916144900 |publisher=Shogakukan |accessdate=2010-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804061906/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8 |archivedate=4 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kakeru'' in this context means to shower or pour. The word ''bukkake'' is often used in Japanese to describe pouring out a liquid with sufficient momentum to cause splashing or spilling. Indeed, bukkake is used in Japan to describe a type of dish where hot broth is poured over noodles, as in [[Udon#Cold|bukkake udon]] and bukkake [[soba]].

==History==
Bukkake was first represented in [[pornographic films]] in the mid to late 1980s in Japan.&lt;ref name="Baker2004" /&gt; According to one commentator, a significant factor in the development of bukkake as a pornographic form was the [[Censorship in Japan#Pornography|mandatory censorship in Japan]] where genitals must be [[Pixelization|pixelated]] by a "mosaic".&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; One consequence of this is that Japanese pornography tends to focus more on the face and body of actresses rather than on their genitals.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Since film producers could not show penetration, they sought other ways to depict sex acts without violating Japanese law and since semen did not need to be censored, a loophole existed for harder sex scenes.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; However, popularization of the act and the term for it has been credited to director [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/04/63009?currentPage=2 |title=Fix for Japan Pop-Culture Addicts |accessdate=2009-07-01 |author=Xeni Jardin |date=4 December 2004 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese adult video studio [[Shuttle Japan]] registered the term "ぶっかけ/ＢＵＫＫＡＫＥ" as a trademark (No. 4545137) in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttle-japan.com/regi.html |title=Registered Trademark|publisher=shuttle-japan.com|accessdate=2010-07-09|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice then spread from Japan to the United States and then Europe in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake&gt;Pp. 31–37 ''My, My American Bukkake'' by Susannah Breslin in Greta Christina, Daniel Clowes, ''Best Erotic Comics 2008, illustrated edition'', Last Gasp, 2007. {{ISBN|0-86719-686-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sigel&gt;{{cite book|title=International exposure: perspectives on modern European pornography, 1800–2000|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|author=Lisa Z.

==Male viewers' motivation==
[[Americans|American]] editor and publisher [[Russ Kick]], quoting a [[sexologist]], states that men enjoy a "sense of closure and finality about sex", something that watching other men ejaculate provides.&lt;ref name="Kick2005" /&gt; The viewer identifies with the ejaculating men, experiencing a sense of vicarious pleasure.&lt;ref name="Kick2005" /&gt; According to [[English–American]] [[anti-pornography]] campaigner [[Gail Dines]], the ejaculate on the female performer's body "also marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership; she quotes veteran American porn actor and producer [[William Margold|Bill Margold]] stating: "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have."&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv" /&gt;

==Reception==
A number of authors have described bukkake as premised on humiliation. [[Forensic psychologist]] [[Karen Franklin]] has described bukkake as symbolic [[group rape]], characterising its primary purpose as the [[Sexual abuse|humiliation]], degradation and [[Sexual objectification|objectification of women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Feminist anti-pornography activist [[Gail Dines]] describes the [[money shot]] of a man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman, taken to a new extreme in bukkake through the involvement of multiple men, as "one of the most degrading acts in porn".&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Dines|title=Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZOjb8Sk1bUC&amp;pg=PR26|accessdate=18 February 2011|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-4452-0|page=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tristan Taormino]], feminist author and sex educator, has likened bukkake to a "gay [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|circle jerk]]", noting the inconsistency between its billing as a heterosexual practice and the fact that it features a group of naked men standing in close proximity to each other, [[masturbating]] together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Taormino | first = Tristan | authorlink = Tristan Taormino | title = Eminem Is My Bitch | date = 13 March 2001 | work = [[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phillip Vannini]], [[associate professor]] in the School of Communication and Culture at [[Royal Roads University]], quotes "self-proclaimed net sex commentator" George Kranz, who views recent American interpretations of bukkake as a "significant advance in human behaviour", emphasising the lively, almost party-like atmosphere of American bukkake videos compared to the more subdued Japanese style.&lt;ref name="Waskul2004" /&gt;

A '''catena''' (from Latin ''catena'', a chain) is a form of biblical commentary, verse by verse, made up entirely of excerpts from earlier [[Biblical commentator]]s, each introduced with the name of the author, and with such minor adjustments of words to allow the whole to form a continuous commentary.

The texts are mainly compiled from mainstream authors, but they often contain fragments of certain [[patristic]] writings now otherwise lost.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). [[Cf.]] Holl, Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter, Leipzig, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been asserted by [[Faulhaber]] that half of all the commentaries on scripture composed by the church Fathers are now extant only in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). See Catholic Encyclopedia article's bibliography listed in the reference section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest Greek catena is ascribed to [[Procopius of Gaza]], in the first part of the sixth century.  Between the seventh and the tenth centuries [[Andreas Presbyter]] and [[Johannes Drungarius]] are the compilers of catenas to various Books of Scripture.  Towards the end of the eleventh century [[Nicetas of Heraclea]] produces a great number of catenae. Both before and after, however, the makers of catenae were numerous in the Greek Orient, mostly anonymous, and offering no other indication of their personality than the manuscripts of their excerpts. Similar compilations were also made in the Syriac and Coptic Churches.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Wright, de Lagarde, Martin, in Krumbacher, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, [[Primasius of Adrumentum]] in the former Roman province of Africa in the sixth century compiled the first catena from Latin commentators. He was imitated by [[Rhabanus Maurus]] (d. 865), [[Paschasius Radbertus]], and [[Walafrid Strabo]], later by [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (d. 900), and by [[Lanfranc of Canterbury]] (d. 1089). The Western catenae have had less importance attached to them. The most famous of the medieval Latin compilations of this kind is that of [[Thomas Aquinas]], generally known as the ''Catena aurea'' (Golden chain) and containing excerpts from some eighty Greek and Latin commentators on the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Ed. J. Nicolai, Paris, 1869, 3 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas composed the parts of his ''Catena aurea'' treating the gospels of Mark, Luke, and John while directing the Roman ''studium'' of the [[Dominican Order]] at the convent of [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].&lt;ref&gt;Torrell, 161 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar collections of Greek patristic utterances were constructed for dogmatic purposes. They were used at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth General Council]] in 553, also apropos of [[Iconoclasm]] in the [[Seventh General Council]] in 787; and among the Greeks such compilations, like the exegetical catenae, did not cease until late in the Middle Ages. The oldest of these dogmatic compilations, attributed to the latter part of the seventh century, is the "Antiquorum Patrum doctrina de Verbi incarnatione".&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Edited by [[Cardinal Mai]] in Scriptor. Vet. nova collectio, Rome, 1833, VII, i, 1-73; cf. [[Loofs]], Leontius von Byzanz, Leipzig, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, in response to homiletic and practical needs, there appeared, previous to the tenth century, a number of collections of moral sentences and paraenetic fragments, partly from Scripture and partly from the more famous ecclesiastical writers; sometimes one writer (e.g. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil the Great]], especially [[John Chrysostom]] whom all the catenae-makers pillage freely) furnishes the material. Such collections are not so numerous as the Scriptural or even the dogmatic catenae. They seem all to depend on an ancient Christian "Florilegium" of the sixth century, that treated, in three books, of God, Man, the Virtues and Vices, and was known as τα ιερά (Sacred Things). Before long its material was recast in strict alphabetical order; took the name of τα ιερά parállela, "Sacra Parallela" (because in the third book a virtue and a vice had been regularly opposed to one another); and was attributed widely to [[John Damascene]],&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Migne, ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XCV, 1040-1586; XCVI, 9-544.&lt;/ref&gt; whose authority was defended (against Loofs, [[Paul Wendland|Wendland]], and Cohn) by [[K. Holl]] in the above-mentioned "Fragmente vornikänischer Kirchenväter" (Leipzig, 1899), though the Damascene probably based his work on the "Capita theologica" of [[Maximus Confessor]]. The text of these ancient compilations is often in a dubious state, and the authors of most of them are unknown; one of the principal difficulties in their use is the uncertainty concerning the correctness of the names to which the excerpts are attributed. The carelessness of copyists, the use of "[[sigla]]", contractions for proper names, and the frequency of transcription, led naturally to much confusion.

==Printed editions==

From the sixteenth century to the nineteenth, various catenas were published.  However no modern editions exist, and there are severe textual problems in editing them.

Among the editors of Greek catenae was the Jesuit [[Balthasar Cordier]], who published (1628–47) collections of Greek patristic commentaries on St. John and St. Luke and, in conjunction with his confrère [[Possin]], on St. Matthew; the latter scholar edited also (1673) similar collections of patristic excerpts on St. Mark and Job. The voluminous catenae known as ''Biblia Magna'' (Paris, 1643) and ''Biblia Maxima'' (Paris, 1660), edited by [[J. de la Haye]], were followed by the nine volumes of ''[[Critici Sacri|Critici Sacri, sive clarissimorum virorum annotationes atque tractatus in biblia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Shahan (1913). Cites: Edited by Pearson, London, 1660; Amsterdam, 1695-1701&lt;/ref&gt; containing selections, not only from Catholic but also from Protestant commentators. 

An important collection of the Greek catenae on the New Testament is that of [[J. A. Cramer]] (Oxford, 1838–44), online at archive.org. See also the twenty-eight volumes of the [[Migne]] commentary in his "Scripturae sacrae cursus completus" (Paris, 1840–45).

For the Byzantine collections of ethical sentences and proverbs of ([[Stobaeus]] Maximus Confessor, [[Antonius Melissa]], [[Johannes Georgides]], [[Macarius]], [[Michael Apostolios]]) partly from Christian and partly from pagan sources, see [[Krumbacher]], pp.&amp;nbsp;600–4, also {{cite|last=[[Anton Elter|Elter]]|first=E.|title=De Gnomologiorum Graecorum historii atque origine|place=Bonn|year=1893}}.

[[Image:Diamond Core.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Rock core samples, the product of a [[Drilling rig#Diamond core drilling|diamond rig]]. A [[pied butcherbird]] perches nearby.]]
A '''core sample''' is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, for example sediment or rock, with a hollow [[steel]] tube called a [[core drill]]. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core bowling". A variety of core samplers exist to sample different media under different conditions. More continue to be invented on a regular basis. In the coring process, the sample is pushed more or less intact into the tube. Removed from the tube in the laboratory, it is inspected and analyzed by different techniques and equipment depending on the type of data desired. 

Core samples can be taken to test the properties of [[manmade]] materials, such as [[concrete]], [[ceramic]]s, some [[metal]]s and alloys, especially the softer ones. Core samples can also be taken of living things, including human beings, especially of a person's bones for microscopic examination to help diagnose diseases.  

== Methods ==
[[Image:Granitic_core_Stillwater.jpg|thumb|60px|Granitic rock core from [[Stillwater igneous complex]], Montana (from a spoil pile).]]
The composition of the subject materials can vary from almost liquid to the strongest materials found in nature or technology, and the location of the subject materials can vary from on the laboratory bench to over 10&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of the Earth in a borehole. The range of equipment and techniques applied to the task is correspondingly great. Core samples are most often taken with their long axis oriented roughly parallel to the axis of a borehole, or parallel to the gravity field for the gravity-driven tools. However it is also possible to take core samples from the wall of an existing borehole. Taking samples from an exposure, albeit an overhanging rock face or on a different planet, is almost trivial. (The Mars Exploration Rovers carry a [[Rock Abrasion Tool]], which is logically equivalent to the "rotary sidewall core" tool described below.)

Some common techniques include:
* ''gravity coring'', in which the core sampler is dropped into the sample, usually the bed of a water body, but essentially the same technique can also be done on soft materials on land. The penetration forces, if recorded, give information about the strength of different depths in the material, which may be the only information required, with samples as an incidental benefit. This technique is common in both civil engineering site investigations (where the techniques tend towards into [[pile driving]]) and geological studies of recent aquatic deposits. The low strength of the materials penetrated means that cores have to be relatively small.
* ''vibracoring'', in which the sampler is vibrated to allow penetration into [[thixotropic]] media. Again, the physical strength of the subject material limits the size of core that can be retrieved.
* ''drilling'' [[exploration diamond drilling]] where a rotating annular tool backed up by a cylindrical core sample storage device is pressed against the subject materials to cut out a cylinder of the subject material. A mechanism is normally needed to retain the cylindrical sample in the coring tool. Depending on circumstances, particularly the consistency and composition of the subject materials, different arrangements may be needed within the core tools to support and protect the sample on its way to surface; it is often also necessary to control or reduce the contact between the [[drilling fluid]] and the core sample, to reduce changes from the coring process. The mechanical forces imposed on the core sample by the tool frequently lead to fracture of the core and loss of less-competent intervals, which can greatly complicate interpretation of the core. Cores can routinely be cut as small as a few [[millimeter]]s in diameter (in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to over 150 millimeters in diameter (routine in [[oil exploration]]). The lengths of samples can range from less than a meter (again, in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to around 200 metres in one run, though 27m to 54m is more usual (in [[oil exploration]]), and many runs can be made in succession if "quick look" analysis in the field suggests that the zone of interest is continuing.
* ''percussion sidewall coring'' uses robust cylindrical "bullets" explosively propelled into the wall of a borehole to retrieve a (relatively) small, short core sample. These tend to be heavily shattered, rendering [[porosity]]/ [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] measurements dubious, but are often sufficient for [[petrography|lithological]] and [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontological]] study. Many samples can be attempted in a single run of the tools, which are typically configured with 20 to 30 "bullets" and propulsive charges along the length of a tool. Several tools can often be ganged together for a single run. The success rates for firing a particular bullet, it penetrating the borehole wall, the retention system recovering the bullet from the borehole wall, and the sample being retained in the bullet are all relatively low, so it is not uncommon for only half the samples attempted to be successful. This is an important consideration in planning sample programmes.
* ''rotary sidewall coring'' where a miniaturised automated rotary drilling tool is applied to the side of the borehole to cut a sample similar in size to a percussion sidewall core (described above). These tend to suffer less deformation than percussion cores. However the core-cutting process takes longer and jams are common in the ancillary equipment which retrieves the sample from the drill bit and stores it within the tool body. This complicates the planning of a coring programme.

==Management of cores and data==
Although often neglected, core samples always degrade to some degree in the process of cutting the core, handling it, and studying it. Non-destructive techniques are increasingly common (e.g. the use of [[MRI]] scanning to characterize grains, pore fluids, pore spaces ([[porosity]]) and their interactions (constituting part of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]) but such expensive subtlety is likely wasted on a core that has been shaken on an unsprung lorry for 300&amp;nbsp;km of dirt road.  What happens to cores between the retrieval equipment and the final laboratory (or archive) is an often neglected part of record keeping and core management.

[[File:Cut Bakken Core samples.jpg|thumb|Cut [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] Core samples]]Coring has come to be recognized as an important source of data, and more attention and care is being put on preventing damage to the core during various stages of it transportation and analysis. The usual way to do this is to freeze the core completely using liquid nitrogen, which is cheaply sourced. In some cases, special polymers are also used to preserve and seat/cushion the core from damage.

Equally, a core sample which cannot be related to its context (where it was before it became a core sample) has lost much of its benefit. The identification of the borehole, and the position and orientation ("way up") of the core in the borehole is critical, even if the borehole is in a tree trunk - [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] always try to include a bark surface in their samples so that the date of most-recent growth of the tree can be unambiguously determined.

If these data become separated from core samples, it is generally impossible to regain that data. The cost of a coring operation can vary from a few currency units (for a hand-caught core from a soft soil section) to tens of millions of currency units (for sidewall cores from a remote-area offshore borehole many kilometres deep). Inadequate recording of such basic data has ruined the utility of both types of core.

Different disciplines have different local conventions of recording these data, and the user should familiarize themselves with their area's conventions. For example, in the oil industry, orientation of the core is typically recorded by marking the core with two longitudinal colour streaks, with the red one on the right when the core is being retrieved and marked at surface. Cores cut for mineral mining may have their own, different, conventions. Civil engineering or soil studies may have their own, different, conventions as their materials are often not competent enough to make permanent marks on.

[[File:Bakken Core samples under a black light.jpg|thumb|Bakken Core samples under a black light]]It is becoming increasingly common to retain core samples in cylindrical packaging which forms part of the core-cutting equipment, and to make the marks of record on these "inner barrels" in the field prior to further processing and analysis in the laboratory.  Sometimes core is shipped from the field to the laboratory in as long a length as it comes out of the ground; other times it is cut into standard lengths (5m or 1m or 3&amp;nbsp;ft) for shipping, then reassembled in the laboratory. Some of the "inner barrel" systems are capable of being reversed on the core sample, so that in the laboratory the sample goes "wrong way up" when the core is reassembled. This can complicate interpretation. [[File:Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core.JPG|thumb|Goniometers are used to measure angles of fractures and other features in a core sample relative to its standard orientation.]]

If the borehole has [[petrophysics|petrophysical]] measurements made of the wall rocks, and these measurements are repeated along the length of the core then the two data sets correlated, one will almost universally find that the depth "of record" for a particular piece of core differs between the two methods of measurement. Which set of measurements to believe then becomes a matter of policy for the client (in an industrial setting) or of great controversy (in a context without an overriding authority. Recording that there are discrepancies, for whatever reason, retains the possibility of correcting an incorrect decision at a later date ; destroying the "incorrect" depth data makes it impossible to correct a mistake later. Any system for retaining and archiving data and core samples needs to be designed so that dissenting opinion like this can be retained.

If core samples from a campaign are competent, it is common practice to "slab" them - cut the sample into two or more samples longitudinally - quite early in laboratory processing so that one set of samples can be archived early in the analysis sequence as a protection against errors in processing. "Slabbing" the core into a 2/3 and a 1/3 set is common. It is also common for one set to be retained by the main customer while the second set goes to the government (who often impose a condition for such donation as a condition of exploration/ exploitation licensing). "Slabbing" also has the benefit of preparing a flat, smooth surface for examination and testing of profile permeability, which is very much easier to work with than the typically rough, curved surface of core samples when they're fresh from the coring equipment. Photography of raw and "slabbed" core surfaces is routine, often under both natural and ultra-violet light.

A unit of length occasionally used in the literature on seabed cores is ''cmbsf'', an abbreviation for centimeters below sea floor.

==History of coring==
The technique of coring long predates attempts to drill into the [[Earth]]’s [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Program]]. The value to oceanic and other [[geologic history]] of obtaining cores over a wide area of [[sea floor]]s soon became apparent. Core sampling by many scientific and exploratory organizations expanded rapidly. To date hundreds of thousands of core samples have been collected from floors of all the planet’s [[ocean]]s and many of its [[inland water]]s. 
Access to many of these samples is facilitated by the [[Index to Marine &amp; Lacustrine Geological Samples]],
:"A collaboration between twenty institutions and agencies that operate geological repositories."
The above agency keeps a record of the samples held in the repositories of its member organizations. Data includes

[[File:Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition.JPG|thumb|Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition]]
==Informational value of core samples==

Coring began as a method of sampling surroundings of ore deposits and oil exploration. It soon expanded to [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[Ice core|ice]], [[mud]], [[soil]] and [[Dendrochronology|wood]]. Cores on very old [[tree]]s give information about their growth rings without destroying the tree. 

Cores indicate variations of [[climate]], [[species]] and [[sediment]]ary composition during geologic history. The dynamic phenomena of the Earth’s surface are for the most part cyclical in a number of ways, especially [[temperature]] and [[rainfall]].

There are many ways to date a core. Once dated, it gives valuable information about changes of climate and [[terrain]]. For example, cores in the ocean floor, soil and ice have altered the view of the geologic history of the [[Pleistocene]] entirely.

In [[computer security]], the "dancing pigs" is a term or problem that describes computer users' attitudes to computer security. It states that users will continue to pick an amusing graphic even if they receive a warning from security software that it is potentially dangerous. In other words, users choose their primary desire features without considering the security. "Dancing pigs" is generally used by tech experts and can be found in IT articles.

== Origins ==
The term has its origin in a remark by [[Edward Felten]] and [[Gary McGraw]]:
{{cquote|Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time.&lt;ref&gt;Gary McGraw and Edward Felten: ''[http://www.securingjava.com/ Securing Java]'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999; {{ISBN|0-471-31952-X}}), Chapter one, Part seven&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Bruce Schneier]] states:
{{quote| The user's going to pick dancing pigs over security every time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=Q&amp;A: Schneier warns of marketers and dancing pigs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10381460-245.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Bruce Schneier expands on this remark as follows:
{{quote|If [[J. Random Websurfer]] clicks on a button that promises dancing pigs on his computer monitor, and instead gets a hortatory message describing the potential dangers of the applet&amp;nbsp;— he's going to choose dancing pigs over computer security any day. If the computer prompts him with a warning screen like: "The applet DANCING PIGS could contain malicious code that might do permanent damage to your computer, steal your life's savings, and impair your ability to have children," he'll click OK without even reading it. Thirty seconds later he won't even remember that the warning screen even existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Schneier: ''[[Secrets and Lies (Schneier)|Secrets and Lies]]'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000; {{ISBN|0-471-45380-3}}), p262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Mozilla]] Security Reviewers' Guide states:
{{quote|Many of our potential users are inexperienced computer users, who do not understand the risks involved in using interactive Web content. This means we must rely on the user's judgement as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/reviewguide.html |title= Mozilla Security Review and Best Practices Guide |date= 17 May 2002 |accessdate= 2 February 2015 |publisher= [[Mozilla Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A widely publicized 2009 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Please Do Not Change Your Password|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/04/11/please_do_not_change_your_password/|first=Mark|last=Pothier|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=11 April 2010|accessdate= 2 February 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly addresses the dancing pigs quotation and argues that users' behavior is plausibly rational:
{{quote|While amusing, this is unfair: users are never offered security, either on its own or as an alternative to anything else. They are offered long, complex and growing sets of advice, mandates, policy updates and tips. These sometimes carry vague and tentative suggestions of reduced risk, never security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=So Long and No Thanks for the Externalities: the Rational Rejection of Security Advice by Users|conference=New Security Paradigms Workshop|conferenceurl=http://www.nspw.org/2009/|year=2009|author=Cormac Herley|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cormac/papers/2009/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Experimental support ==
One study of [[phishing]] found that people really do prefer dancing animals to security. The study showed participants a number of phishing sites, including one that copied the [[Bank of the West]] home page:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Phishing Works|author=Rachna Dhamija, J. D. Tygar and Marti Hearst|url=http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rachna/papers/why_phishing_works.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306023403/http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rachna/papers/why_phishing_works.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For many participants the "cute" design, the level of detail and the fact that the site does not ask for a great deal of information were the most convincing factors. Two participants mentioned the animated bear video that appears on the page, (e.g., "because that would take a lot of effort to copy"). Participants in general found this animation appealing and many reloaded the page just to see the animation again.}}

Schneier believes the dancing pigs problem will lead to crime, a key threat. He said: "The tactics might change (...) as security measures make some tactics harder and others easier, but the underlying issue is constant." Ignoring computer security can inflict various types of damage resulting in significant losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=Q&amp;A: Schneier warns of marketers and dancing pigs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10381460-245.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=October 23, 2009|quote=The tactics might change--phishing, pharming, key logging, social engineering, password guessing, whatever--as security measures make some tactics harder and others easier, but the underlying issue is constant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Discover Sensors''' project is an initiative of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) to support the use of sensor technology in hands-on scientific investigations by Junior Certificate Science students. It is designed to provide students with an experience of "real science" in the classroom, supporting the investigative approach promoted by the revised [[Junior Certificate]] Science syllabus. DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science &amp; Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9772 Article in Silicon Republic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205060423/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9772 |date=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterford-today.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1644&amp;Itemid=1&amp;ed=136 Article in Waterford Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.ie/article/10123534.html Article in ENN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419061334/http://www.enn.ie/article/10123534.html |date=April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project also has a website to support [[teachers]] and [[students]], and encourages teacher collaboration via broadband technology using the [[Moodle]] online learning support system.

Discover Sensors now has 190 participating schools throughout [[Ireland]]. If you are a Junior Certificate Science teacher, Discover Sensors can assist you by bringing new learning opportunities to your students using sensor technology.

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science Week Ireland]], [[Discover Primary Science]], [[Greenwave]] and [[Science.ie]].

The '''Earth [[Institute]] Center for [[Environmental quality|Environment]]al [[Sustainability]]''' ('''EICES''', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ai|s|iː|z}}), formerly known as the Center for [[Environmental Research]] and Conservation (CERC), consists of two institutions located at [[Columbia University]]. The first is an [[Earth Institute]], which was begun as the first Earth Institute in 1995. The second is the Secretariat for the Consortium for Environmental Research and Conservation, a collaboration between the Earth Institute, the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[New York Botanical Garden]], The [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] and [[EcoHealth Alliance]] on [[biodiversity]] conservation.

EICES primary goal is protecting biodiversity and [[ecosystem]]s. The Earth Institute Center for Environmental Sustainability is "dedicated to the development of a rich, robust and vibrant world within which we can secure a sustainable future."

EICES is headquartered at the [[Earth Institute]], [[Columbia University]]. This location facilitates multidisciplinary work within the university and with external collaborators.

EICES is also responsive to the non-science community, providing training and education through the application of understandable, robust [[Conservation biology|conservation science]].

== Research ==
EICES facilitates the development of research programs between its consortium members: the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), Columbia University, the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and EcoHealth Alliance. Some activities are consortium-wide, representing all the institutions, while others can involve just two or three consortium partners. Collectively, the consortium’s research covers the globe with programs in over 60 countries.

Throughout EICES’s 18-year history, consortium researchers, volunteers, interns, students, faculty and staff have been involved in:

*Finding new species of plants and animals in biodiversity hotspots
*Mapping the movement of wildlife and [[Zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]] that pass from animals to humans
*Studying the evolution of [[primate]] [[behavior]]
*Examining how forests respond to disturbance
*Studying ecosystem processes and ecosystem services like carbon storage by tropical trees and grasslands
*Understanding how to develop participatory conservation programs
*Working on the restoration of damaged [[habitat]]s
*Exploring models for sustainable development through a balance of good economics, governance and conservation

In addition to research activities and projects, EICES adjunct faculty and research scientists adjunct scientists teach science courses in the Department of [[Ecology]], [[Evolution]], and [[Environmental science|Environmental Biology]] (E3B) and in the EICES [http://eices.columbia.edu/education-training/see-u/ Summer Ecosystem Experience for Undergraduates] Program (SEE-U) and [http://eices.columbia.edu/education-training/certificate/ Certificate Program] in Conservation and Environmental Sustainability. Instructors are faculty and staff at consortium institutions and the consortium often provides research opportunities for Columbia’s undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. students, especially those in E3B.

== Education and training ==
The Earth Institute Center for Environmental Sustainability (EICES) brings together five renowned scientific, academic and cultural institutions: Columbia University, American Museum of Natural History, New York Botanical Garden, Wildlife Conservation Society and EcoHealth Alliance (formerly known as Wildlife Trust). Since its inception in 1994, EICES’s ambitious educational agenda has evolved in response to the emergent issues of environmental and ecological sustainability. Programs encompass graduate, undergraduate and K-12 levels, as well as those for private and public sector executives and citizens interested in environmental sustainability. The overarching goal of EICES’s education programs is to ensure that research informs what we teach in the classroom.

'''Far-infrared astronomy''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] that deals with objects visible in [[far-infrared]] radiation (extending from 30 [[µm]] towards [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] wavelengths around 450&amp;nbsp;µm).

In the far-infrared, stars are not especially bright, but we{{who|date=March 2018}} can see emission from very cold matter (140 Kelvins or less) that is not seen at shorter wavelengths.

Huge, cold clouds of gas and dust in [[Milky Way|our own galaxy]], as well as in nearby [[galaxy|galaxies]], glow in far-infrared light. This is due to [[thermal radiation]] of [[Interstellar Dust|interstellar dust]] contained in [[molecular clouds]].&lt;ref name="caltech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html|title=Near, Mid and Far-Infrared|accessdate=2013-01-28|publisher=Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html|archivedate=2012-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some of these clouds, new stars are just beginning to form. Far-infrared observations can detect these [[protostar]]s long before they "turn on" visibly by sensing the heat they radiate as they contract.

The center of our galaxy also shines brightly in the far-infrared: These emissions are from dust in [[circumstellar shell]]s around numerous old [[red giant]] stars. These stars heat up the dust and cause it to glow brightly in the [[infrared]]. The [[Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS)|Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey]] mapped the galaxy for the first time in the far-infrared.&lt;ref name="caltech" /&gt;

Except for the plane of our own [[Milky Way|galaxy]], the brightest far-infrared object in the sky is central region of a [[galaxy]] called [[Messier 82]]. The nucleus of M82 radiates as much energy in the far-infrared as all of the stars in our galaxy combined. This far-infrared energy comes from dust heated by a source that is hidden from view. The central regions of most galaxies shine very brightly in the far-infrared. Many galaxies ("[[Active galaxy|active galaxies]]") have active [[galaxy nucleus|nuclei]] hidden in dense regions of dust. Others, called [[starburst galaxy|starburst galaxies]], have an extremely high number of newly forming stars heating [[interstellar cloud|interstellar dust clouds]]. These galaxies, far outshine all others galaxies in the far-infrared.&lt;ref name="caltech" /&gt;

The Earth's atmosphere is opaque over most of the far-infrared, so that ground-based observations are limited to submillimetre wavelengths using high-altitude telescopes such as the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], the [[Caltech Submillimeter Observatory]], the [[High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz Telescope]] and the [[Submillimeter Array]]. Most far-infrared astronomy is performed by satellites such as the [[Herschel Space Observatory]], [[Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]], [[IRAS]], and [[Infrared Space Observatory|ISO]]. Upper-atmosphere observations are also possible, as conducted by the airborne [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy|SOFIA]] telescope.

On 22 January 2014, [[European Space Agency|ESA scientists]] reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of [[water vapor]] on the [[dwarf planet]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], largest object in the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref name="KüppersO’Rourke2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küppers |first1=Michael |last2=O’Rourke |first2=Laurence |last3=Bockelée-Morvan |first3=Dominique |last4=Zakharov |first4=Vladimir |last5=Lee |first5=Seungwon |last6=von Allmen |first6=Paul |last7=Carry |first7=Benoît |last8=Teyssier |first8=David |last9=Marston |first9=Anthony |last10=Müller |first10=Thomas |last11=Crovisier |first11=Jacques |last12=Barucci |first12=M.

[[File:Matteucci's frog battery trimmed2.jpg|thumb|300px|Matteucci's frog battery, 1845 (top left); Aldini's frog battery, 1818 (bottom); apparatus for controlled exposure of gases to frog battery (top right).]]
A '''frog battery''' is an [[battery (electricity)|electrochemical battery]] consisting of a number of dead frogs (or sometimes live ones), which form the [[electrochemical cell|cells]] of the battery connected in a [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] arrangement.  It is a kind of [[biobattery]].  It was used in early scientific investigations of electricity and academic demonstrations.

The principle behind the battery is the ''injury potential'' created in a muscle when it is damaged, although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries; the [[potential difference|potential]] being caused incidentally due to the dissection of the frog's muscles.

The frog battery is an example of a class of biobatteries which can be made from any number of animals.  The general term for an example of this class is the '''muscular pile'''.

The first well-known frog battery was created by [[Carlo Matteucci]] in 1845, but there had been others before him.  Matteucci also created batteries out of other animals, and [[Giovanni Aldini]] created a battery from ox heads.

==Background==
In the early days of electrical research, a common method of detecting electric current was by means of a [[frog's leg galvanoscope]].  A good supply of live frogs was kept to hand by the researcher ready to have their legs prepared for the galvanoscope.  Frogs were therefore a convenient material to use in other experiments.  They were small, easily handled, the legs were especially sensitive to electric current, and they carried on responding longer than other animal candidates for this role.&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1849), pp.28-29&lt;br /&gt;Valli, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Matteucci's frog battery detail.jpg|thumb|150px|Frog half-thighs in series]]
It was usual to use the thighs of frogs for the battery construction.  The legs of the frog were first skinned, then the lower leg was cut off at the knee joint and discarded.  Damaging the muscle during this procedure would detract from the results.  The thigh muscle was then cut in two transversely to produce two half-thighs.  Only the lower, conical shaped piece was kept.  The half-thighs were then laid on an insulator of varnished wood so arranged that the inside surface of one was in contact with the outside surface of the next, with the conical ends of the outside surface being pushed into the cavity of the cut surface.  The ends of the pile were placed in cups of water sunk into the wood and formed the terminals of the battery.&lt;ref name=Medico311&gt;Longet and Matteucci, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NhYCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Traité des phénomènes electro-physiologiques des animaux", "Rapport entre le sens du courant electrique et les contractions musculaires dues et ce courant"] ''The Medico-chirurgical Review'', '''vol.46''', p.311, April 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matteucci (1848), p.391&lt;br /&gt;Rutter, pp.110-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrangement of inside surface connected to outside surface was on the basis of the incorrect theory that there was an electric current in muscles continually flowing from the inside to the outside.  It is now known that the half-thighs were more successful at generating electricity because they had suffered the greatest injury to the muscle.  This effect of increased [[electric potential]] due to injury is known as ''demarcation potential'' or ''injury potential''.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p.199&lt;br /&gt;Hellman, p.32&lt;br /&gt;Kipnis, pp.144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Other constructions could also be used.  For instance the complete rear legs could be used with the [[sciatic nerve]]s exposed so that the nerve of one frog could be connected to the feet of the next.  Whole frogs too could be used.  Although it was more time consuming to prepare the thigh muscles, most experimenters preferred to do this since it gave better results.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frog battery from Bird.jpg|thumb|200px|Bird's diagram of a frog battery, 1848]]
The first frog battery was constructed by [[Eusebio Valli]] in the 1790s with a chain of 10 frogs.  Valli had difficulty understanding all of his own results; he followed [[Luigi Galvani]] in believing that ''animal electricity'' (or [[galvanic electricity]]) was a different phenomenon from metal-metal electricity (or [[voltaic electricity]]), even denying its existence.  [[Alessandro Volta]]'s theory was proved correct when he succeeded in constructing the [[voltaic pile]] without the use of any animal material.  Because Valli found himself on the wrong side in this dispute, and refused to change his opinion despite the evidence, his work has become a bit of a backwater and his frog battery is little known and poorly documented.&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1848), p.344&lt;br /&gt;*Valli, p.155, Experiment 122 uses 10 frogs&lt;br /&gt;Kipnis, pp.144-145&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aldini's ox battery.jpg|thumb|left|Aldini's 1803 ox-head battery.]]
[[Leopoldo Nobili]] built a frog battery in 1818 out of complete frog legs which he called a '''frog pile'''.  He used this to investigate animal electricity but his experiments were strongly criticised by Volta who argued that the true source of electricity was dissimilar metals in the external circuit.  According to Volta, fluids in the frog merely provided the electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p.199&lt;br /&gt;Clarke &amp; O'Malley, p.186&lt;br /&gt;Hellman, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

The first well-known frog battery was constructed by [[Carlo Matteucci]] which was described in a paper presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1845 by [[Michael Faraday]] on his behalf.  It later also appeared in the popular medical student physics textbook ''Elements of Natural Philosophy'' by [[Golding Bird]].  Matteucci constructed his battery from a pile of 12 to 14 half-thighs of frogs.  Despite the misguided theory behind the half-thigh battery, Matteucci's frog battery was nevertheless sufficiently powerful to decompose [[potassium iodide]].  Matteucci aimed with this apparatus to address Volta's criticism of Nobili by constructing a circuit, as far as possible, entirely out of biological material and hence prove the existence of animal electricity.  Matteucci also studied the effects vacuum, various gases, and poisons had on the frog battery, concluding that in many cases its operation was not affected even when the substance would be toxic or lethal to the living animal.&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1848), pp.344-345&lt;br /&gt;Hellman, p.32&lt;br /&gt;Matteucci (1845), pp.284-285&lt;/ref&gt;

Frogs were not the only creatures to be press-ganged into serving as battery components.  In 1803 [[Giovanni Aldini]] demonstrated that electricity could be obtained from an ox head from a freshly killed animal.  A frog galvanoscope connected between the ox's tongue and ear showed a reaction when the circuit was completed through the experimenter's own body.  A greater reaction was obtained when Aldini joined two or three heads together into a battery.  Later, in the 1840s, Matteucci also created eel batteries, pigeon batteries and rabbit batteries.  Further, he created a battery out of ''living'' pigeons by connecting a wound made on the breast of one pigeon to the body of the next.  Matteucci states that this design was based on a pre-existing battery of living frogs.&lt;ref name=Medico311/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1848), p.341-342&lt;br /&gt;Matteucci (1848), p.391&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===

Bangladesh has 5 toll bridges and 4 toll roads. None of them are of an electronic collection system. In Bangladesh, roads and bridges are built by the Government. After building the roads and bridge, the governmement invites tender to give an Operation and management (O&amp;M) contract for 5 years against a fee. The O&amp;M operators maintains the bridge and collects toll on behalf of the government. The toll tariff of Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge (formerly known as Jamuna Bridge), length 4.8&amp;nbsp;km, the longest bridge of the country is considered very high compared with other bridges. Mr. Md. Mobarak Hossain, the CEO of Marga Net One Limited (Joint Venture by Pt. Jasa Marga (Persaro) Indonesia and Net One Solutions Ltd. Bangladesh who was also the CEO of the 2nd O&amp;M Operator of Bangabandhu (Jamuna) Bridge, feels that Taka 400 (USD 6.00)per private car is too high, while the trucks and loriies pays a maximum of USD 18.00 for single trip. The Bangabandhu Bridge is a vital link connecting the eastern part of the country with its northern part.

===China===

Nearly all Chinese expressways and express routes charge tolls, although they are not often networked from one toll expressway to another. However, beginning with the [[Jingshen Expressway]], tolls are gradually being networked. Given the size of the nation, however, the task is rather difficult.

[[China National Highway]]s, which are not expressways, but "grade-A" routes, also charge tolls. Some provincial, autonomous-regional and municipal routes, as well as some major bridges, will also charge passage fees. In November 2004, legislation in China provided for a minimum length of a stretch of road or expressway in order for tolls to be charged.

===Hong Kong===
{{further|List of tunnels and bridges in Hong Kong}}
In [[Hong Kong]], most tunnels and some bridges that form part of the motorway networks are tolled to cover construction and maintenance costs.  Some built recently are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) basis.  The companies which build the tunnels or bridges are given franchise of a certain length of time (usually 30 years) to operate.  Ownership will be transferred to the government when the franchise expires. An example is the [[Cross Harbour Tunnel]].

=== India===
{{main|Indian Expressways}}
[[Image:Mumbai Pune ExpresswayDec2007.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai-Pune Expressway]], [[India]]]]
[[Expressway (India)|Access-controlled roads]] in India are tolled. In addition to cash tolls, toll plazas have dedicated [[electronic toll collection]] lanes for quicker operation.

In addition, most of the [[NHDP|upgraded sections]] of the [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] network are also tolled. These tolls are lower than those on expressways. The length of [[Expressway (India)|Indian Expressways]] is more than {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}}, also more than {{convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} of expressways are already under construction.

Currently, a [[National Highways Development Project|massive project]] is underway to expand the highway network and the [[Government of India]] plans to add an additional {{convert|18637|km|abbr=on}} of expressways to the  network by the year 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_expressway-cost-pegged-at-rs20-crore-km_1381235 Govt plans to build 18637 km expressways]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
''Further information: [[List of toll roads in Indonesia]]''
[[Image:Jakpek36.JPG|thumb|KM 36 of [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]].]]
[[Indonesia]] opened its first toll road, the [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], in 1978. This linked the capital city of [[Jakarta]] to the neighboring cities of [[Bogor]] and [[Ciawi]] south of the capital. 
Today, the system is still limited in its existence, as major toll routes remain in and around the major cities of [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Semarang]]. 
Recently, development in inter–city routes has increased. In 2005, the [[Cipularang Toll Road]] connecting [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] to [[Jakarta]] was completed. This is a major development for the Indonesian transport system, as a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]] can now be completed in just under 3 hours.

In 2015, the [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]] connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Cirebon]] in [[West Java]] was completed. This is another major development as this Toll Road connects [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]] and [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], and a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Central Java]] using this Toll Road can now be completed around 4 hours.

Indonesia had 34 toll roads until October 2015 :

'''North Sumatra''' : 
[[Belmera]], connecting [[North Sumatra]].

'''Jakarta and Banten''' : 
[[Jakarta–Serpong Toll Road]], [[Jakarta–Tangerang Toll Road]], [[Tangerang–Merak Toll Road]], 
[[Prof. Dr. Sedyatmo Toll Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Banten]].

'''Jakarta''' :
[[Jakarta Inner Ring Road]], [[Jakarta Outer Ring Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]].

'''Jakarta and West Java''' :
[[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]], [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]] and [[Jakarta]].

'''West Java''' :
[[Cipularang Toll Road]], [[Padaleunyi Toll Road]], [[Bogor Ring Road]], [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]], [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], [[Kanci–Pejagan Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]].

'''Semarang, Central Java''' :
[[Semarang Section A, B, C Toll Road]], [[Semarang–Ungaran Toll Road]] connecting [[Semarang]].

'''East Java''' :
[[Surabaya–Gresik Toll Road]], [[Surabaya–Gempol Toll Road]], [[Waru–Juanda International Airport Toll Road]], 
[[Surabaya–Madura Bridge Toll Road]], connecting [[East Java]].

'''Denpasar, Bali Island''' :
[[Bali Mandara Toll Road]], connecting Ngurah Rai Airport–Nusa Dua, Ngurah Rai Airport–Denpasar–Benoa.

'''Makasar, South Sulawesi''' :
[[Makassar Airport Toll Road]], connecting [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport]].	
 
Plans for another inter–city route in [[Central Java]] between the cities of [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]] are under development. Eventually,{{when|date=April 2016}} the whole city in island of Java will be connected by [[Trans–Java toll road]] from [[Merak, Banten|Merak]], [[Banten]] to [[Ketapang]], [[East Java]]. If the [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] is built, the highway network in Java and Sumatra will be connected. By 2025, Indonesia may be connected with the Asia by [[Malacca Strait Bridge]] and [[Trans-Sumatra Toll Road]]. Indonesia also has a project to build [[Trans-Kalimantan Toll Road]] and [[Trans-Sulawesi Toll Road]].

===Israel===
[[Image:Israel Toll Symbol.svg|150px|thumb|right|Israeli toll road sign, showing the [[Israeli new sheqel]] symbol: ₪]]
[[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]] in [[Israel]], widely known as the Trans-Israel Highway or Cross-Israel Highway, is to date the only electronic toll highway in Israel. Currently Highway 6 is 110&amp;nbsp;km long, all of which is a freeway. This figure will grow in the next few years as additional segments, currently undergoing statutory approvals and permitting processes, are added to the main section of the road. Highway 6 uses a system of cameras and [[transponders]] to toll vehicles automatically. There are no toll booths, allowing Highway 6 to be designed as a normal freeway with interchanges.

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Expressways of Japan}}
The vast majority of Japan's extensive expressway consists of toll roads. Payment of the fare can either be made in cash as one exits or using the [[electronic toll collection]] card system.  As of 2001 the toll fees for an ordinary passenger car was 24.60 [[yen]] per kilometre plus a 150 yen terminal charge.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Malaysian Expressway System}}
[[Malaysia]] has extensive toll roads that forms the majority of country's expressways which in length spans more than 1400&amp;nbsp;km ranging North to the Thai border, South to the Causeway and Second Link to Singapore, West to Klang and Pulau Indah and East towards Kuantan.  Most of the toll roads are in major cities and conurbations such as [[Klang Valley]], [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Penang]].  All of Malaysian toll roads are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] basis as in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] (see [[#Japan|below]]).

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Motorways of Pakistan}}
All motorways and few expressways are toll roads. First such motorway M2 was opened to public in 1997. Since then the M3, M9, M10, and M1, all toll roads, have become operational. The M8 is under construction.

[[File:SLEX Skyway Northbound.jpg|thumb|[[Metro Manila Skyway]]]]
[[File:NAIA Expressway southbound.jpg|thumb|[[NAIA Expressway]]]]
Currently, the [[Philippines]] have ten toll roads, all on the main Island of [[Luzon]].

The 84 kilometer [[North Luzon Expressway]] or NLEx, connecting [[Manila]] with the Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It starts at [[Balintawak Interchange]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]] and ends at Sta. Ines in [[Pampanga]].

The 93.77 kilometer [[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway]] or SCTEx, connecting the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]], [[Clark Freeport Zone]], and the Central Techno Park in [[Tarlac City]], [[Tarlac]]. It is also connected to the North Luzon Expressway via a Spur Road in Mabalacat, Pampanga which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It is the longest expressway in the Philippines.

The 51 kilometer [[South Luzon Expressway]] or SLEx connecting [[Manila]] with [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]]. It is composed of two segments namely, the Osmeña Highway (formerly/also known by many as South Superhighway) which starts from [[Paco, Manila]] and continues until [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]] and the Alabang-Calamba-Santo Tomas Expressway, which is also known as the South Luzon Tollway (SLT), which comprises the Alabang to Santo Tomas, Batangas segment.

The 16 kilometer [[Metro Manila Skyway]] or simply Skyway is an elevated expressway that connects Manila with [[Alabang]], [[Muntinlupa City]] which is located above the SLEX.

The 42 kilometer [[Southern Tagalog Arterial Road]] or STAR Tollway which runs south from [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]] to the City of [[Batangas City|Batangas]]. It is also connected to the South Luzon Expressway via an exit in Santo Tomas, Batangas since 2010 which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of the Southern part of Luzon as it also a part or extension of the Radial Road 3 network (see [[Radial Road 3]]).

The 14 kilometer [[Manila–Cavite Expressway]] or CAVITEx is an expressway in the south of the Manila metropolitan area. Connects Manila with the province of [[Cavite]].

The 88.85 kilometer [[Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway]] is a four lane expressway currently under construction north of Manila in the Philippines. It connects Central Luzon and North Luzon. It starts at SCTEX in Tarlac Exit and currently ends at Binalonan Exit in [[Pangasinan]]. When the expressway is complete, the northern terminus will be at Rosario Exit in [[La Union]].

The 8.8&amp;nbsp;km [[Subic-Tipo Expressway]] or the NLEx Segment 7 is a two lane expressway in which the alignment traverses the provinces of [[Zambales]] and [[Bataan]]. It begins at Rizal Highway in [[Hermosa, Bataan]] and ends at [[Subic Freeport Zone]]/SBMA at [[Olongapo, Zambales]].

The 4&amp;nbsp;km [[Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway]], which is also known as MCX and formerly Daang Hari-SLEX Link Expressway is a long access-controlled toll expressway linking the southern province of [[Cavite]] to [[Muntinlupa]] in the [[Philippines]]. The east end is the SLEX in Muntinlupa and the west end is at Daang Hari and Daang Reyna Road junction in Cavite.

The 11.6 kilometer [[NAIA Expressway]] is an elevated expressway that runs from the [[Metro Manila Skyway]] to [[Diokno Boulevard]], and [[Ninoy Aquino Avenue]] and [[NAIA Road]] near [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] Terminal 3. This elevated expressway project is divided into 4 packages. This is also the first airport expressway in the Philippines. It is located in [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]], and a little portion in [[Taguig]].

Only the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway (including the Skyway) have an [[electronic toll collection]] system, which is based on the 5.7&amp;nbsp;GHz standard.

===  Singapore ===
''Further information: [[Singapore Area Licensing Scheme]], [[Electronic Road Pricing]]''

In Singapore, toll stations are automated, thus reducing manpower. The automated toll stations, also known to the locals as [[Electronic Road Pricing|ERP]] or Electronic Road Pricing, was introduced by [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) to reduce city traffic jams. Although it is advanced, it is still unpopular among Singaporean drivers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The number of toll stations is increasing rapidly and some Singaporeans even call it "Every road pay".

=== Sri Lanka ===

Sri Lanka currently operates 2 toll roads. The Southern Expressway (E 01) and the Katunayake Expressway (E 03). The Kandy Colombo Expressway (E 02) is under planning at the moment (2013). The toll revenue is used to repair and maintain the expressways.

=== Taiwan===

[[Image:Taiwan Freeway Toll Station Notification.gif|250px|left|thumb|A typical toll booth notification sign in Taiwan]]
[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.3.png|100px|right|thumb|Taiwanese Toll Booth Sign off freeways meaning: stop the vehicle to pay toll]]

Freeways in Taiwan are not exactly toll roads in the sense that toll gates/stations are not located at the entrance and exits of the freeway.  Toll stations with [[weigh station]]s are located every thirty to forty kilometres on the No. 1 and No. 3 National Freeways of the [[Republic of China]]. There are usually no freeway exits once a toll station notification sign appears, making it necessary for the driver to be familiar with the locations of the toll stations in advance.

''See [[Highway System in Taiwan#Toll station]] for more detailed information.''

Other toll roads in Taiwan are usually newly built bridges and tunnels. Tolls are frequently collected to pay off the construction cost and once paid off, the tolls may be repealed.

=== Tajikistan ===
Toll roads in Tajikistan are owned and operated by Innovative Road Solutions (IRS). The northern point is in the in Sughd Viloyat and the Southern point ends at Kurgan Tyube (100&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital of the country - Dushanbe). While going from end to end costs roughly $12 US Dollars for regular 2 axle vehicles, it can top to $100 for semitrucks. The IRS is setting up new toll plazas that are going to be able to read off the digital device attached to windshield while passing through at the speed of no more than 15 kph, similar to ones in the United States. This is the only toll road in the entire Central Asia with about 5 cars going through each toll plaza every minute in every direction. The more information can be found on their homepage at www.IRS.tj

=== Thailand ===
Most of the toll roads in Thailand are either within [[Greater Bangkok]] or originated from Bangkok.  They are called [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], [[tollway]]s, and [[motorway]]s.  Two government agencies under the Ministry of Transport, namely the Expressway Authority of Thailand (EXAT) and the Department of Highways (DoH), own networks of toll roads.  Some are operated by the agencies themselves; others are operated by private concessionaires.  EXAT is in charge of Chaloem Mahanakhon Expressway, Si Rat Expressway, Chalong Rat Expressway, Udon Ratthaya Expressway, Burapha Withi Expressway and Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road (southern section).  DoH is in charge of Uttraphimuk Tollway (formerly [[Don Mueang]] Tollway), Motorway No. 7 (Bangkok-[[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]), and Motorway No. 9 (Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road - eastern section).  Both agencies have plans to build more toll roads in the future, expanding their networks to the provinces.

[[Electronic Toll Collection]] using passive [[RFID]] tags is used in Chaloem Mahanakhon, Si Rat, Chalong Rat, and Burapha Withi Expressway while Uttraphimuk Tollway  employs passive IC-card-based [[contactless payment|Touch-and-Go]] system.  There are plans to upgrade and expand ETC systems in the near future.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The toll system [[Salik (Road Toll)|Salik]] started in [[Dubai]] in July 2007.

== Africa ==

===Morocco===
[[Image:A3 Rabat.jpg|thumb|[[Casablanca–Rabat expressway]]]]
[[Morocco]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autoroutes. These were for the most part recently built, and from [[Casablanca]] connect all of Moroccos major cities such as [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], and [[Tangier]]. Operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|Autoroutes Du Maroc]] runs the network on a pay-per-use basis, with toll stations placed along its length. Goal is completing a North-South and an East-West link crossing the country. Both axis will be important sections of the ''Pan-African'' main links.&lt;ref&gt;Moroccan operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|ADM's]][http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf Year 2007 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194551/http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}, PDF file, downloaded 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
The Mozambique South Africa Tollway was established in 2014 and is run by private contractors leasing the highway from the Mozambican Government and tolls will be established on many other important paved roads in Mozambique

===South Africa===
In South Africa many of the [[National routes (South Africa)|National routes]] have sections that are toll roads. In cities such as [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]] the freeways are free of charge. However, with the introduction of electronic tolling (e-tolls) as part of the [[Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project]], tolls were introduced on the upgraded the urban freeways that are National Roads in the province of [[Gauteng]], which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]]. These Gauteng tolls met resistance in the media and from parts of the population.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195422/http://www.thinkafricapress.com/south-africa/buckle-up-going-be-long-ride-e-tolls-gauteng-anc-da] Toll roads are run by the [[South African National Roads Agency Limited]][http://www.nra.co.za/index.html] or in the case of routes like the N3 and N4, by concessionaires.

===Zimbabwe===
In 2013 the Ntabazinduna Toll Plaza was opened outside of Bulawayo and the toll system was introduced by a South African Group named Group Five as part of a government project to provide safer highways and to also benefit the local community and also the local economy. Additionially eight more toll plazas will be operating in Zimbabwe.

== Europe ==
{{Main|Toll roads in Europe}}
Toll roads in Europe have a long history. The first turnpike road in England was authorised in the seventeenth century. The term ''turnpike'' refers to a gate on which sharp pikes would be fixed as a defence against cavalry. Early references include the (mythical) Greek ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] charging [[Charon's obol|a toll to ferry (dead) people]] across the river [[Acheron]]. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across [[mountain pass]]es. Tolls were used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 14th century and 15th century.

In some European countries payment of road tolls is made using stickers which are affixed to the windscreen.  [[Germany]] uses [[Toll Collect|a system]] based on satellite technology for large vehicles.  In other countries payment may be made in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card or by an [[electronic toll collection]] system. Tolls may vary according to the distance travelled, the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Some of these toll roads are privately owned and operated.  Others are owned by the government.  Some of the government-owned toll roads are privately operated.

=== Belarus ===
Major highways in Belarus are [[toll roads]] with [[Open road tolling]] (ORT) or free-flow tolling. BelToll is an [[electronic toll collection]] system (ETC), valid from 1 July 2013 in the Republic of Belarus.

=== Croatia ===
[[Image:Autocesta A1 kod Trogira.jpg|thumb|[[A1 (Croatia)|A1 motorway]] near [[Trogir]].]]
Almost all Croatian highways are [[toll road]]s with the exception of the [[Zagreb bypass]] and [[Rijeka bypass]]. Most of the highways feature a [[closed toll collection]] system. Tolls are usually calculated according to the basic formula of 0,40 [[Croatian kuna|kn]]/km, multiplied by a factor according to the vehicle category. There are four [[Vehicle classification in Croatia|vehicle categories in Croatia]]:

# two-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the front axle, including motorcycles
# three and multi-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans
# vehicles more than 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans with trailers
# same as the 3rd class, but at least four axles

At some motorways, the motorcycles are classified as a separate category and charged less than two-axle vehicles.

Each class of vehicles pays approximately 1,5 times the toll paid by the previous class. The length and the exact toll for a highway section can be found at the official website of Croatian highway authority.&lt;ref name="hrhac"&gt;[[Hrvatske autoceste]] (HAC) - Croatian highway authority&lt;/ref&gt; If a highway features an [[open toll collection]] system, the toll for the whole highway is paid at a mainline plaza. Such toll collection attracts the [[shunpike]]rs.

There are four Croatian companies that build and maintain highways and collect tolls:

* [[Hrvatske autoceste]] (Croatian Motorways Ltd)
* [[Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj]] (Zagreb - Macelj Motorway)
* [[Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb]] (Rijeka - Zagreb Motorway)
* [[BINA Istra]]

=== France ===
[[Image:French Autoroute.jpg|thumb|A typical French autoroute.]]
In Europe, the most substantial use of toll roads is in [[France]], where most of the [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]s carry quite heavy tolls. In a number of countries the companies have often fallen in and out of the public sector,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and many have had financial problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Iceland ===
The [[Hvalfjörður Tunnel]] is tolled.

=== Ireland ===
The [[Republic of Ireland]] has three toll roads, three toll bridges, and two toll tunnels, which are operated by various independent operators. Most were built under a [[public-private partnership]] system, giving the company which arranged for the road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from €1.65 to €12 for cars.

=== Italy ===

Most [[Autostrada|Italian motorways]] are toll roads, with some exceptions such as some motorways in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] or the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' ([[Rome]]'s ring road).

In most motorways, toll is proportional to the distance traveled and has to be paid on exit, where toll gates — {{it}} ''caselli'' — are placed. On other motorways, however, toll gates are placed directly along the route — {{it}} ''barriere'' —. In such cases, it is required to pay a fixed amount, regardless of the distance traveled. [[Autostrada A8 (Italy)|A8]], [[Autostrada A9 (Italy)|A9]], [[Autostrada A52 (Italy)|A52]] are good examples of that system.

Toll can be paid in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card, or by [[Telepass]].

61% of the Italian motorways are handled by the "Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A." company, and its subsidiaries. All of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by ANAS. The network of motorways covers most of [[Italy]]: northern and central Italy are well covered, the south and Sicily are scarcely covered, [[Sardinia]] is not covered at all.

The motorway operators are required to build, operate and maintain their networks at cost and to cover their expenses from the toll they collect. The tolls vary according to the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Besides the motorways, only some alpine tunnels (such as the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]]) are tolled. Today, no toll is required on other roads, including motorway-like [[dual carriageway]]s — {{it}} ''superstrade''. The first tolled superstrada is under construction now north of Venice.

=== The Netherlands ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, almost all communities collected toll on all passing traffic, usually including pedestrians and livestock. In 1953, the central government abolished all communal tolls.

As of 2008, there are three effective toll roads in Netherlands. They are for the [[Western Scheldt Tunnel]], [[Kil tunnel]], both major arteries, and the "Tolbrug" (Toll Bridge) in [[Nieuwerbrug]], a local hand-drawn bridge. Also, for the [[Wijkertunnel]], a "shadow toll" is paid by [[Rijkswaterstaat]] for each passed vehicle.

=== Norway ===
Norway has extensively been using toll as a way to finance road infrastructure in the last decades. The toll is called "bompenger" (gate coin) which from comes the first toll roads in Norway, private roads where owners were allowed to charge traffic. The toll ends when the road has been paid off.

There are also toll rings around some cities, where drivers have to pay to enter or leave the city, regardless of if the road is new or old. The first city was [[Bergen]] in 1986. The money goes to construction of intrastructure in and around the city.

=== Poland ===
[[File:Punkty poboru opłat.svg|thumb|Toll plazas in Poland]]
There are three toll highways in Poland, connecting the major cities and the nation's boundaries. Two routes travel east–west, one running between [[Łódź]] and the German border, the other currently connecting [[Katowice]] and [[Kraków]], with current construction extending the roads to the German and Ukrainian boundaries. A north–south route connects Rybnik to Katowice, and [[Torun]] to [[Gdańsk]].

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]] a certain number of roads are designated Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being [[Brisa - Auto-estradas de Portugal|BRISA]]. For cash-free payments there exists the [[Via Verde]], an electronic toll collection system. On leaving the motorway, charges are automatically debited from a bank account.

=== Russia ===
A number of toll roads in Barnaul and Pskov Region (Nevil-Velezh (RUR 190 ($8)), Pechori-state border RUR 140), also M4-Don (18&amp;nbsp;km close to Lipetsk costs RUR20($0,75) for cars and RUR40 ($1,7) for trucks).

Overall toll network is 383&amp;nbsp;km or 0,05% of total road network. Average price in Pskov region having 226&amp;nbsp;km of toll roads is RUR 2,4-5,5 per km for cars, and RUR 7,9-19,5 for trucks. This comes close to $0,5 per km for trucks.

Ordinary speed limits apply so far. In 2007 adopted Toll Road Law and Concession Law in 2005 to develop this sector.

=== Slovenia ===
For the use of 464,7&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Highways in Slovenia|Slovenian freeways and expressways]] use of toll stickers is obligatory for all vehicles with the permissible maximum weight of 3.5 tons on motorways and expressways as of July 1, 2008. The sticker costs are €15 for 7 days, €30 for a month and €95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay €7.50 for 7 days, €25 for a half year and €47.50 for a year.&lt;ref name=price_DARS&gt;[http://www.dars.si/Dokumenti/Toll/Methods_of_payment/Vehicles_up_to_35_t/Vignette_308.aspx Vignette prices on DARS.si]&lt;/ref&gt; Trucks use existing toll road stops.&lt;ref name=cestnina&gt;[http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 Cestnina v Sloveniji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826075216/http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 |date=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of €300 or more.&lt;ref name=wieninternational /&gt;

Due to the high costs of toll stickers for transit drivers going to vacation to [[Croatia]]n and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] coast and others only passing through Slovenia, the highways are avoided by some travellers.&lt;ref name=wieninternational&gt;{{cite web

=== Spain ===
Most [[Spain|Spanish]] toll roads are networked, so you must get a ticket on entering and pay when leaving the road. Technically, all roads belong to the Government, although toll roads are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road is reverted to State ownership, however most of then are renewed. Toll roads are called in Spanish ''[[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]''. Freeways, often comparable to ''autopistas'' in building and ride quality, are called '' [[autovía]]s''.

There are some ''autovías'' which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logroño A-12&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navarra.es/home_es/Actualidad/Informes/Obras+Publicas+Transportes+y+Comunicaciones/Autivia+Pamplona-Estella+Logrono.htm Navarra.es Navarran Autonomous Community news bulletin, February 5 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php Noticias de Navarra, May 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205716/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid access road M45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/M-45/negocio/sombra/elpepuespmad/20050808elpmad_1/Tes El País, August 8 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The company assumes the building costs and the [[Autonomous Community]] where they are located (in the given examples, [[Navarre]] and [[Madrid]]) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics, called "shadow toll" (in Spanish, ''peaje en la sombra'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html Capital Madrid, march 30 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730010406/http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html |date=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the build of new roads at the expense of the building company. Also, since the payment starts only after the road is finished, construction delays are usually shorter than those of regular state-owned freeways. However, those cannot be classified as toll roads since drivers do not need to pay any fees.

=== Sweden ===
The border-crossing [[Oresund Bridge|The Oresund Bridge]] and [[Svinesund Bridge]] have tolls. The [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg congestion tax|Gothenburg]] City areas have [[congestion pricing]] on entry. The [[Sundsvall Bridge]] is a proper toll bridge. Before the year 2000 road tolls did not exist in Sweden for several decades.

=== Switzerland ===

[[Image:A2 Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] in [[Ticino]], suspended over viaducts]]
For the use of [[Motorways of Switzerland|Swiss motorways]] the use of toll stickers is obligatory. They costs CHF&amp;nbsp;40 per year per vehicle (a car towing a trailer needs two stickers). There are no stickers for shorter periods and they are valid 14 months (the 2010 sticker is valid from 1 December 2009 until 31 January 2011). However, this also means that a sticker bought any time during the year can only be used for less than the maximum period until January 31 of the following year.

=== Republic of Turkey ===

In the Republic of [[Turkey]] toll is collected on certain highways, the so-called ''Otoyolları'' or ''Karayolları''. This is done so by three different systems. Every toll road has lanes for all three payment methods. One method is KGS (Kartlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Card passage system'') which requires a [[Stored-value card|Prepaid]] card to be presented at the toll port. Every passing will be withdrawn from the card. Another method is HGS (Hızlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Fast passage system''.) which uses a [[RFID]] chip stuck to the windshield of the vehicle. This chip is scanned automatically when passing the toll collecting point and money will be automatically withdrawn from the connected bank account. The last system is OGS which is calles ''Otomatik Geçiş Sistemi'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and translates ''Automatic passage system'' in [[English language|English]]. This form of payment requires a fixed amount of money to be paid for a monthly or annual subscription. When subscribed, your car will be equipped with a [[barcode]]d sticker, which will be checked by [[CCTV]] cameras automatically to check if the car is actually subscribed. The Turkish toll system can't be avoided (except for avoiding toll roads), because one can simply not pass KGS without the required card, and due to the cameras, all cars passing OGS and HGS with no or expired or counterfied chips or stickers will get a fine nicely presented at their home address.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Toll roads in Great Britain|Turnpike Trust}}
[[Image:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|[[M6 Toll|M6]] Toll plaza for northbound traffic at [[Great Wyrley]]]]
Road rates were introduced in [[England]] in the seventeenth century. The first turnpike road, whereby travellers paid tolls to be used for road upkeep, was authorised in 1663 for a section of the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] in [[Hertfordshire]].  The first [[turnpike trust]] was established by Parliament through a Turnpike Act in 1706. From 1751 until 1772 there was a flurry of interest in turnpike trusts and a further 390 were established. By 1825 over 1,000 trusts controlled 25,000 miles (40,000&amp;nbsp;km) of road in England and [[Wales]].

The rise of [[railway]] transport largely halted the improving schemes of the turnpike trusts. Unable to earn sufficient revenue from tolls alone the trusts took to requiring taxes from the local parishes. The system was never properly reformed but from the 1870s Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities, the last trust vanishing in 1895. The [[Local Government Act 1888]] created county councils and gave them responsibility for maintaining the major roads. There are still a small number of toll bridges left including [[Swinford toll bridge]] near [[Oxford]].

Most UK roads today are maintained from general taxation, some of which is raised from motoring taxes including [[Hydrocarbon oil duty|fuel duty]] and [[vehicle excise duty]].  Today, there are few tolls on roads in the United Kingdom - mainly toll bridges and tunnels. Until recently there were only two toll roads to which there is a [[public right of way]] (Rye Road in [[Stanstead Abbotts]] and College Road in [[Dulwich]]) together with another five or so private toll-roads. However, the motorway recently constructed to the north of [[Birmingham]] levies a usage charge, and is therefore known as the [[M6 Toll]]. It is potentially the first of a new generation of toll roads.

== North and South America ==

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], toll roads are a recent institution, and were adopted mostly in non-federal [[highways]]. The state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] has the highest length of toll roads, which are exploited either by private companies which bought a concession from the state, or by a state owned company (see [[Highway system of São Paulo]]). In São Paulo there is also a statewide electronic collection system using a plastic transponder (e-tag) attached to the windscreen, named ''SemParar'''. There is a growing trend towards tolling in all major highways of the country, but some resistance by the population is beginning to be felt, particularly due to some abuses which are being imposed, restricting the constitutional rights of coming and going (because the Brazilian highway system has very few non-tolled vicinal roads in parallel to highways) and making some trips an extremely expensive affair, as compared to average Brazilian earning power (in São Paulo, a 1,000&amp;nbsp;km round trip may cost upward of two hundreds [[Brazilian real]] in some roads, higher than petrol expenses).

=== Canada ===
Most tolled roadways in [[Canada]] are bridges to the [[United States]], although a few domestic bridges in some provinces have tolls. In [[Vancouver]], tolls were set up to pay for the construction of the new [[Port Mann Bridge]] which connects the [[Trans Canada Highway]] from [[Surrey]] to [[Coquitlam]] over the [[Fraser River]].  Toll highways disappeared, for the most part, in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the 1990s, political pressure dropped the new tolls on an upgraded section of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in [[New Brunswick]].  [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is a modern ''toll route'' and does not have collection booths but an overhead sensor. It's heavily criticized as the government leased it for 99 years with the company having unlimited control of the highway and tolls so it is expensive, but still a necessity for gridlocked [[Toronto]]. [[Nova Scotia]] has a toll highway on the Trans Canada Highway between [[Debert, Nova Scotia|Debert]] and [[Oxford, Nova Scotia|Oxford]].

=== Colombia ===
Many highways in [[Colombia]] charge tolls. Motorcycles are allowed to bypass for free.

=== Ecuador ===
The [[Pan-American Highway]] in [[Ecuador]] charges tolls. Motorcycles pay a reduced fare.

=== Mexico===
[[Mexico]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autopistas. Autopistas are built and funded by Federal taxes and are built to nearly identical standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Also, many states in Mexico have their own toll roads such as Puebla, Veracruz and Nuevo León. Motorcycles pay the same fare as cars.
All federal toll highways operate with 3 payment options, cash, credit card and electronic tag IAVE.
IAVE in all the highways is operated by Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE).

=== Panama ===
Most of the toll roads in [[Panama]] were built in the mid 1990s, with the exception of the [[Arraijan-Chorrerra Highway]]. The three modern toll roads were built after the transportation plan made by the Government of [[Japan]] in the mid 1980s using the [[Build–operate–transfer|BOT]] formula. This highways are the [[Corredor Norte]] in the north of the [[Panama City]], and the [[Corredor Sur]] in the south. Another highway was built and is the [[Panama-Colon Highway]].

=== Puerto Rico ===
There are several toll roads in Puerto Rico, where toll roads are called "autopista" (which loosely translates to "car raceway") and toll houses are called "peaje".

=== United States ===
{{Main|Toll roads in the United States}}
[[Image:Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound.jpg|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] westbound, approaching Pittsburgh interchange with I-376/US 22.]]
[[Image:Dallas North Tollway - Texas State Highway Loop 12 Northwest Highway - 4548 - jpfagerback 2013-05-07.jpg|thumb|[[Dallas North Tollway]] just north of the [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Northwest Highway]]]]

A ''toll road'' in the United States, especially near the east coast, is often called a ''turnpike''. The term ''turnpike'' originated from the ''turnstile'' or gate which blocked passage until the fare was paid at a ''toll house'' (or ''toll booth'' in current terminology). Most tolled facilities in the US today use an [[electronic toll collection]] system as an alternative to paying cash. Examples of this are the [[E-ZPass]] system used on most [[toll bridge]]s and toll roads in the eastern U.S. from [[North Carolina]] to [[Maine]] and [[Illinois]]; [[Houston]]'s [[EZ Tag]], which also works in other parts of the state of [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]]'s [[PikePass|Pikepass]] (which also works in Texas and Kansas), [[California]]'s [[FasTrak]], [[Illinois]]' [[I-Pass]], and [[Florida]]'s [[SunPass]]. Toll roads are only in 26 states as of 2006. The majority of states without any turnpikes are in the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Southern United States|South]].

After a halt in toll road construction following the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1956, many states are going back to implementing tolls to fund capital improvements and manage congestion.  This is because the cost of expanding and maintaining the highway network is increasing faster than the amount of revenue that can be generated by the federal [[gasoline tax]] for the [[Highway Trust Fund]].  Years after abolishing tolls, [[Kentucky]] and [[Connecticut]] are both re-examining the possibility of reinstating tolls on some highways, while several other states are advancing the construction of new toll roads to supplement their existing networks of toll-free expressways.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a small number of motorways have been tolled due to cover the expense of their construction. Such roads can be found in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. There are no toll roads in the Australian states of [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] or any of the mainland [[States and territories of Australia|territories]]. Toll collection is by electronic toll collection; there are no longer any cash booths in Australia.

In [[Brisbane]], there are three tollway operators ([[Brisbane City Council]], [[Queensland Motorways]], and [[RiverCity Motorway]]).  Brisbane City Council owns and operates the [[Go Between Bridge]] over the [[Brisbane River]] in the city.  Queensland Motorways operates the tolls on the [[Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges]], and another two on the [[Logan Motorway]] on the south side.  RiverCity Motorway operates the [[Clem Jones Tunnel]], which runs underneath the city between the inner southern and northern suburbs.  All toll collection points are electronically operated. Another company, BrisConnections, is currently constructing another toll tunnel (the longest tunnel in Australia) called the [[Airport Link, Brisbane|Airport Link]], and will allow traffic to flow from the northern Clem Jones - [[Inner City Bypass]] interchange, direct to [[Brisbane Airport]].  Construction is due to be complete in 2012. International Travellers and people that are new to Brisbane should note, the penalty for non payment of tolls is in excess of $140 (per trip). It is best to avoid toll roads at all costs as it really saves little time and is often classed by the general Brisbane public as "revenue raising".

In [[Melbourne]], there are two companies that operate tollways within the Melbourne metropolitan area. Transurban operates [[CityLink]] covering sections of the [[Monash Freeway]], Southern Link, Western Link and the upgraded sections of the [[Tullamarine Freeway]]. ConnectEast operates [[EastLink, Melbourne|EastLink]] that runs through the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. All Melbourne tollways are electronically tolled. The [[West Gate Bridge]] opened as a toll bridge upon its completion in 1978, however the toll was abolished in 1985.

In [[Sydney]], many of the motorways contain at least one tolled section with a mixture of government and private ownership. The State Government owns the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], while the [[Metroad 2|M2 Motorway]], [[Metroad 4|M4 Motorway]], [[Metroad 5|M5 Motorway]], [[Eastern Distributor]], [[Westlink M7]] and [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] are privately operated by a variety of companies such as Macquarie Infrastructure, Transurban, and to a lesser extent Industry Super funds such as Retail Employees Super, SunSuper, and the Industry Funds Management which partly own the M5 motorway in South Western Sydney.

As well as the tolled motorways, the [[Cross City Tunnel]] - an east–west route underneath the Sydney CBD - was opened to traffic in 2005. This road has become somewhat controversial due to the relatively high toll charge and the closure of surrounding roads designed to funnel traffic through the tunnel.

All Sydney tollways accept E-tags; the [[Westlink M7]], [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], [[Cross City Tunnel]], [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] and from 1 December 2007 on the [[M2 Hills Motorway|M2 Motorway]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000527/http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30] [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22023173-5001021,00.html] have no cash booths, just E-Tag readers to zoom on through as they charge their tolls only through electronic tolling methods or through the use of number plate reading as you go through, then you have to pay after a certain time frame (for example; before 24 hours), otherwise you will get a fine in the mail. The [[M5 South Western Motorway|M5 Motorway]] moved to electronic only tolling in 2013. Tolls on the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4 Motorway]] were abolished in 2010. An E-Tag is an RFID device that allow a driver to pass through a toll point without physically stopping. When a vehicle fitted with an E-Tag passes through a toll collection point, the E-Tag identifies the electronic account of the vehicle passing through and the toll-road operator recovers the toll via that account. There are four providers of E-tag accounts in New South Wales (RTA, RoamTag, Interlink Roads, and M2 Consortium). All tags provided by these four providers can be used on every E-Tag-enabled tollway in Australia.

=== New Zealand ===
* [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] was opened in 1959 and operated as a toll bridge until 1984. In the 1960s a group of university students attempted to disrupt the toll system by repeatedly crossing the bridge using motor-scooters (to which a very low toll applied), and paying their toll in £5 notes; the hope was that they would exhaust the supplies of change held at the toll booths. However, the toll authority got wind of their plans and got a very large supply of small change (copper coinage), so the students were soon weighed down with large amounts of small change.
* The [[Lyttelton Road Tunnel]], linking the City of [[Christchurch]] with the harbour at [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], was originally a Toll Tunnel built in 1962. The government of the day promised that as soon as the tunnel was paid for, the toll would be removed The promise was kept, and the toll was removed in the mid-1970s once the tunnel had been paid off. The Tunnel Authority building and toll booths are still there at the Heathcote end.
* The City of [[Tauranga, New Zealand|Tauranga]] operates a toll road running between the outlying settlement of Tauriko on State Highway 2 and central business district of the city. This toll road also act as a feeder route for the [[Tauranga Harbour Bridge]]. Tolls are collected by staff operating tollbooths at the western end of the road.
* The Northern Gateway Toll Road is a 7.5&amp;nbsp;km motorway extension to State Highway 1 just north of [[Auckland]]. Northbound, the toll road begins just before [[Orewa]] and ends via a pair of road tunnels through the Johnstone Hills near Puhoi. The toll road opened in January 2009 and gives motorists a choice between a more direct route or State Highway 17 via Orewa. Tolling is implemented through automatic vehicle license plate reading with cameras in an overhead gantry.

A '''great conjunction''' is a [[Astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] of the planets [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="animation" group="Note"&gt;
[http://www.geogebratube.org/student/m21235 Orbital Motion Simulation of Jupiter and Saturn]
&lt;/ref&gt; The last great conjunction took place on May 31, 2000, while the next one will be in late December 2020. Great conjunctions take place regularly, every 18–20 years, as a result of the combined ~12-year orbital period of Jupiter around the Sun, and Saturn's ~30-year orbital period. The 2000 conjunction fell within mere weeks after both had passed conjunction with the Sun, and it was very difficult to observe without visual aid because the two planets rose only 30–45 minutes before sunrise, depending upon the location of the observer.

A ''greatest conjunction'' is a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn at or near their [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. In this scenario, Jupiter and Saturn will occupy the same position in [[right ascension]] on three separate occasions over a period of a few months. Such tripled occurrences are actually known as [[triple conjunction]]s.

== As omens ==
{{original research section|date=February 2018}}

Great conjunctions have attracted considerable attention as celestial omens. There has been some speculation,{{by whom|date=February 2018}} for example, that the so-called "[[Star of Bethlehem]]" was a great conjunction that occurred c. 7 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Molnar: The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi, Rutgers University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; During the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], great conjunctions were a topic broached by most astronomers of the period up to the times of [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Kepler]], by scholastic thinkers as [[Roger Bacon]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Opus Majus'' of Roger Bacon, ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford:Clarendon Press, 1897, Vol. I, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Pierre d'Ailly]],&lt;ref&gt;'' De concordia astronomice veritatis et narrationis historice'' (1414) [http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/pdf/fah1620p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and they are mentioned in popular and literary writing by authors such as [[Dante]]&lt;ref name=Woody&gt;Woody K., ''Dante and the Doctrine of the Great Conjunctions'',Dante Studies, with the Annual Report of the Dante Society, No. 95 (1977), pp. 119–134&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name=Aston&gt;Aston M., ''The Fiery Trigon Conjunction: An Elizabethan Astrological Prediction'', Isis, Vol. 61, No. 2 (Summer, 1970), pp. 158–187&lt;/ref&gt; This interest is traced back in Europe to the translations from Arabian sources, most notably [[Albumasar]]'s book on conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;''De magnis coniunctionibus'' was translated in the 12th century, a modern edition-translation by K. Yamamoto and Ch. Burnett, Leiden, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

As successive great conjunctions occur nearly 120° apart, their appearances form a triangular pattern. In a series every fourth conjunction returns after some 60 years in the vicinity of the first. These returns are observed to be shifted by some 7–8°, so no more than four of them occur in the same zodiacal sign.  To each triangular pattern astrologers have ascribed one from the series of [[Classical element|four elements]] and thus four ''[[Triplicity|triplicities]]'' or ''trigons'' are formed. Particular importance has been accorded to the occurrence of a great conjunction in a new trigon, which is bound to happen after some 200 years at most.&lt;ref&gt;Etz D., (2000), ''Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn'', Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol. 94, p.174 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000JRASC..94..174E]&lt;/ref&gt; Even greater importance was attributed to the beginning of a new cycle after all fours trigons had been visited, something which happens in about 800 years. Since each 'element' (trigon) consists of 3 signs it takes 800x3=2400 for the whole process to start anew (relation with the cycle of Precession).

[[Image:Keplers trigon.jpg|thumb|250px|Kepler's trigon, a diagram of great conjunctions (from the book ''De Stella Nova'' (1606) by [[Johannes Kepler]])]]

Originally a trigon was thought{{by whom|date=February 2018}} to last 240 years, and the full cycle 960 years; but later more correct estimation were provided by the [[Alphonsine tables]].&lt;ref name="Woody"/&gt; Despite the inaccuracies and some disagreement about the beginning of the cycle the belief in the significance of such events generated a stream of publications which grew steadily up to the end of the 16th century. As the great conjunction of 1583 was the last in the watery trigon it was widely supposed to herald apocalyptic changes; a [[papal bull]] against divinations was issued in 1586 and as nothing really significant had happened by 1603 with the advent of a new trigon, the public interest rapidly died.

=== Great conjunctions and US president deaths ===
According to financial astrologer Daniel T. Ferrera,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mysteries of Gann Analysis Unveiled!|last=Ferrera|first=Daniel T.|publisher=Sacred Science Institute|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whenever a great conjunction occurs during an election or inauguration year, the president is likely to die in office. Careful analysis shows that, although it remained correct from 1840 to 1960, this rule started to “lose its power” after 1980. However, even though those presidents did not die in office, they still came close in each case. See the table below for details:

[[Image:Basho by Kinkoku c1820.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portrait of [[Matsuo Bashō]] by [[Yokoi Kinkoku]], c. 1820. The calligraphy relates one of Bashō's most famous haiku poems: ''Furu ike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto'' (An old pond / a frog jumps in / the sound of water).]]

'''{{nihongo|''Haiga''|俳画||extra=haikai drawing}}''' is a style of [[Japanese painting]] that incorporates the [[aesthetics]] of ''[[haikai]]''. ''Haiga'' are typically painted by [[haiku]] poets (''haijin''), and often accompanied by a haiku poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Daijirin'' entry for ''haiga''|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%BF%B3%E7%94%BB|work=Kotobank dictionary aggregator website|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the poetic form it accompanied, ''haiga'' was based on simple, yet often profound, observations of the everyday world. [[Stephen Addiss]] points out that "since they are both created with the same brush and ink, adding an image to a haiku poem was&amp;nbsp;... a natural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, ''haiga'' vary widely based on the preferences and training of the individual painter, but generally show influences of formal [[Kanō school]] painting, minimalist [[Zen painting]], and [[Ōtsu-e]], while sharing much of the aesthetic attitudes of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' tradition. Some were reproduced as [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]]. The subjects painted likewise vary widely, but are generally elements mentioned in the [[calligraphy]], or poetic images which add meaning or depth to that expressed by the poem. The moon is a common subject in these poems and paintings, sometimes represented by the Zen circle ''[[ensō]]'', which evokes a number of other meanings, including that of the [[Mu (negative)|void]]. Other subjects, ranging from [[Mount Fuji]] to rooftops, are frequently represented with a minimum of brushstrokes, thus evoking elegance and beauty in simplicity.

==History==
[[Image:A little cuckoo across a hydrangea(Haiga) by Yosa Buson.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A little cuckoo across a hydrangea by [[Yosa Buson]].]]

[[Nonoguchi Ryūho]] (1595–1669), a student of [[Kanō Tan'yū]], is sometimes credited{{By whom|date=November 2012}} with founding the style; though poetry was commonly accompanied by images for centuries prior, Ryūho was the first poet to regularly include paintings alongside his calligraphy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Matsuo Bashō]], known worldwide as the definitive master of haiku, frequently painted as well. ''Haiga'' became a major style of painting as a result of association with his famous works of haiku.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Like his poems, Bashō's paintings are founded in a simplicity which reveals great depth, complementing the poems they are paired with. Towards the end of his life, he studied painting under [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], his pupil in poetry; the works of both men benefited from the exchange, and a number of works were produced combining Morikawa's painting with Bashō's poetry and calligraphy.

Composing haiku, and painting accompanying pictures, was a common pastime of [[Edo period]] aesthetes, who would pursue these activities in their spare time, or at friendly gatherings as a communal form of entertainment. The famous novelist [[Ihara Saikaku]] was one of many people not normally associated with either poetry or painting, who took part. By contrast, the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' painter [[Yosa Buson]], widely considered second only to Bashō as a master of haiku, is said to be "the only artist to be included in surveys both of great poets and great painters in Japanese history."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other schools of painting which maintained a standard set of styles passed from master to apprentice, the genre of ''haiga'' encompassed a variety of artists with different approaches. Some, like Bashō, were primarily poets, accompanying their compositions with simple sketches,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} while others, like Buson, were primarily painters, devoting more space and centrality of focus to the image.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Maruyama Goshun]] and [[Ki Baitei]] were among those who tended to paint portraits of poets and other figures in a relatively quick, loose style which looks somewhat [[cartoon]]ish to the modern eye. Some ''haiga'' paintings, such as those by [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], reflect the formal training of the artists, while others, like those by [[Nakahara Nantenbō]], reflect the artist's background in [[Zen]].

One overall trend that developed over time, despite this wide variety, was a shift from the circles of literati (''bunjin'') painters to the orbit of the [[Shijō school]] of the naturalistic painter [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]. This move was effected primarily by Maruyama Goshun,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and can be seen as well in the works of [[Yamaguchi Soken]]. Some later painters, such as [[Takebe Sōchō]], were influenced by ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' styles, and used color in highly detailed works.

Though traditional-style ''haiga'' are still produced today, contemporary artists experiment with the style, coupling haiku with digital imagery, photography, and other media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">The '''Heidelberg Research Architecture''' (HRA)&lt;ref&gt;http://hra.uni-hd.de&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Digital Humanities]] unit of the [[Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"]] at [[Heidelberg University]].
It embraces digital resource development, project consultation and trainings for researchers and students. The HRA’s specialists work with researchers and students at the Cluster to form an integrated digital humanities environment for transcultural studies. Its agenda ranges from developing the Tamboti ecosystem that allows transcultural relations to be traced and analysed across diverse media types (texts, images, films, audio) and disparate objects (texts, concepts, social networks), to offering hands-on workshops on digital humanities tools for researchers working at the Cluster and Heidelberg University. Furthermore, digital resources and their production are increasingly integrated into teaching environments. The HRA provides advice to researchers on how to conceptualize and implement digital resources to structure their research.
As a cooperation partner at local, national, and international level the HRA works together with partners from the public as well as the private sector.

==The Tamboti ecosystem==
At the core of the HRA’s work is the development of the Tamboti ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;http://tamboti.uni-hd.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamboti is modular, and currently (November 2014) features these modules:
* [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]] editor
* Ziziphus [[Visual Resources Association#VRA Core Categories|VRA Core 4]] editor&lt;ref&gt;http://ziziphus-help.uni-hd.de&lt;/ref&gt;
* Atomic Wiki
Tamboti serves as central access point to data from several different collections, where users can store and share, but also edit and comment on it. The ecosystem facilitates research collaboration and academic exchange in the field of Digital Humanities. Tamboti contains multilingual bibliographical information on books and articles as well as research based metadata on image collections, videos and various forms of digital material. It is possible to search the different types of sources and establish semantically qualified relations between them. Tamboti's modular design makes it flexible to use and adopt for research. On the back-end Tamboti makes use of [[EXist|eXist-db]]. Data is stored in XML using international [[Metadata standards|metadata schema]], like [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]], [[Metadata Authority Description Schema|MADS]], [[Visual Resources Association#VRA Core Categories|VRA Core 4]], or [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] which allows for both, interchangeability and sustainability of the knowledge. Tamboti is [[open source software]]. International metadata standards and terminologies are used to ensure sustainability.

'''HomeSeer Technologies LLC''' is a technology company based in [[Bedford, New Hampshire]], in the United States. HomeSeer makes [[home automation]] controllers and software, designed to integrate lighting, [[HVAC]], security, [[Audiovisual|AV]] and other subsystems in most homes. Additionally, the company maintains an online store of compatible home automation products and a free online community [[Internet forum|forum]] for users and dealers.

== History ==

===1999-2004===
[[File:HomeSeer_HS1_CD_Media.png|thumb|HS1 v1.7 distribution CD from 2004.]]
HomeSeer was founded in 1999 by company president Richard Helmke. At the time, Helmke was employed as Software Project Leader for [[Cabletron Systems|Cabletron]] (later becoming [[Enterasys Networks|Enterasys]]) in [[Rochester, New Hampshire]]. Helmke developed an interest in home automation and set about to find a software program that would fit his needs. After trying several programs, Helmke elected to create his own program (initially named ''AutoHome''), and launched that effort, as a part-time pursuit, under the company name "Keware". Shortly after release, Keware was renamed ''HomeSeer'' and AutoHome was renamed ''HomeSeer v1'' or ''HS1'' for short. At first, the software was compatible with [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] light switches, plug-in modules and controllers. Over time, support was added for additional products such as the ADI Ocelot, JDS Stargate controller and WGL W800 wireless receivers. An open [[API]] coupled with a freely available [[Software development kit|SDK]] was added to encourage 3rd party development of plug-in (drivers) for support of additional technologies and products. HS1 included support for remote internet access and voice control using [[Microsoft Speech API|Microsoft speech technology (SAPI)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/Working-Home-2016743.php| title=Simple, low-cost automation kit turns lights on when nobody's home |publisher=Houston Chronicle| last=Currid| first=Cheryl| date=16 August 2001| accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sales of HS1 increased, a message board forum was implemented to provide community-based support for HS1 users.

In 2002, Helmke left his position at Enterasys to focus solely on HomeSeer.

In 2003, driver support was added to HS1 for [[Z-Wave]], a wireless [[Mesh networking|mesh network]] technology. At that time, the technology was in its infancy with only a handful of lighting products available from ''Advanced Control Technologies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://products.z-wavealliance.org/Search/DoAdvancedSearch?regionId=2&amp;category=-1&amp;manufacturer=13|title=Z-Wave Product Catalog|publisher=Z-Wave Alliance|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]]. As of 2015, the [[Z-Wave|Z-Wave Alliance]] reported there were more than 1,400 Z-Wave certified products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave-pavilion-promotes-robust-smart-home-ecosystem-to-installer-community-at-cedia-expo/|title=Z-Wave Pavilion Promotes Robust Smart Home Ecosystem to Installer Community at CEDIA EXPO.|publisher=[[Z-Wave|Z-Wave Alliance]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including light switches, thermostats, door locks, water valves, garage door controllers, sensors and other products.

In 2004, HomeSeer released its first hardware product, the ''ZU0100-001'' Z-Wave USB interface. This product functioned as a Z-Wave [[transceiver]] to allow HS1 software to communicate with wireless Z-Wave devices.

===2005-2010===
August 2005 marked the release of HS2 software. The new version was designed as a [[web application]] to allow for remote set up and configuration, as well as remote control. A professional version (HSPRO) targeting custom installers and featuring advanced Z-Wave support with pre-licensed plug-ins, was also released. In December, the company's first hardware controller (PRO-100) was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/reviews/channel-programs/189501102/review-homeseers-home-controller-gets-smarter.htm|title=Review: HomeSeer's Home Controller Gets Smarter|publisher=CRN|last=Morejon|first=Mario|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRO-100 was a [[Mechanical fan|fan-less]] design with [[Solid-state drive#DOM|DOM]] storage that included an embedded installation of HSPRO software.

In 2006, HomeSeer released the ''Z-Troller'', a handheld Z-Wave network controller that doubled as a Z-Wave interface. Since Z-Troller was both a network controller ''and'' interface, it supported advanced features such as network optimization and network backup and restore. In October, the PRO-100 was upgraded to a faster Series II model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/10/28/homeseer-announces-pro-100-series-ii-home-automation-controller/|title=HomeSeer announces PRO-100 Series-II home automation controller|publisher=Engadget|last=Murph|first=Darren|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, HomeSeer released the ''HSM100'', a battery operated Z-Wave 'multisensor' with built-in sensors for [[Motion detector|motion]], [[Thermometer|temperature]] and [[Photodetector|light level]]. The HSM100 was well suited for home automation ''events'' that relied on some combination of its sensor data. HomeSeer's ''HomeTroller'' was also released in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/press_release_homeseer_unveils_new_hometroller_home_automation_controller/ |title=HomeSeer Unveils New HomeTroller Home Automation Controller |publisher=CEPro.com |accessdate=25 November 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide functionality similar to the PRO-100 but at a lower price point. Unlike the PRO-100, the original HomeTroller was equipped with a conventional mechanical hard drive, active cooling (with fans) and embedded HS2 software. Subsequent versions were released with passive cooling (no fans) and with DOM, [[Secure Digital|SD Card]] or [[SSD]] storage to improve reliability.

In 2009, HomeSeer released its first [[mobile app]], a software program called ''HSTouch''. Originally developed for [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iOS]] platform, HSTouch gave HomeSeer users the ability to monitor and control their homes with their [[iPhone]]s and [[iPod]]s. A companion program, ''HSTouch Designer'', was also released for those who wished to customize the mobile app with their own screen designs and graphics.

In 2010, HomeSeer released its [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version of HSTouch mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_hstouch_android_app/|title=HomeSeer is putting customized HSTouch control into the palm of Android users.|publisher=CEPro|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, HomeTroller was upgraded to the S3 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_exploits_rise_of_android_fall_of_charmed_quark/|title=HomeSeer Exploits Rise of Android, Fall of Charmed Quark|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011-2013===
[[File:HomeTroller-SE_Home_Controller.png|thumb|HomeTroller-SE was in production from 2011-2014]]
In 2011, HomeSeer released the HomeTroller-SE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/reviews/homeseer-hometroller-se-pro-home-automation-controller-review.html|title=HomeSeer Hometroller SE-Pro Home Automation Controller Review|publisher=Automated Home|last=Watt|first=Ken|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its new entry level controller. The -SE model featured a less powerful [[CPU]] and fewer features than the standard HomeTroller model but at approximately half the cost. An even lower cost ''HomeTroller-Mini'' was also in the works with a prototype unit debuting at CES 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/homeseer-hometroller-mini-home-automation-controller-gets-you-on/|title=HomeSeer HomeTroller-Mini home automation controller gets you one step closer to the bachelor pad of the future|publisher=Engadget|last=Trout|first=Christopher|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the HomeTroller-Mini design was later abandoned before release because of parts availability and cost issues.

In 2013, HomeSeer released HS3, a significant upgrade to the HS2 version. HS3 included an all-new [[JQuery UI|JQuery]] web [[GUI]], redesigned automation 'engine', multi-network Z-Wave support and new counter and timer features. A professional version, ''HS3PRO'', was also released to service the dealer channel.

HomeSeer's HomeTroller Zee was also released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_debuts_its_smallest_cheapest_home_automation_hub/|title=HomeSeer Debuts its Smallest, Cheapest Home Automation Hub|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zee was based on the [[Raspberry Pi|Raspberry Pi1 model B computer]], included HS3 software and was bundled with an [[Aeon Labs]] Z-Stick Z-Wave interface. HomeTroller Zee replaced the HomeTroller-SE as the company's entry level home controller.

===2014===
In January 2014, HomeSeer introduced voice programming and automatic camera support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocoontech.com/forums/page/articles/_/news/events/ces-2014-exclusive-update-homeseer-technologies-r781|title=CES 2014: Exclusive Update - HomeSeer Technologies|publisher=Cocoontech|last=Lavelle|first=Morgan|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_adds_camera_voice_support_to_hometroller_zee/|title=HomeSeer Adds Camera, Voice Support to HomeTroller Zee|publisher=CEPro|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their controllers. Voice programming allowed users to create automation events solely by voice using any Android mobile device. Automatic camera support was designed to automatically detect and configure settings for [[Foscam]] brand IP cameras. This allowed the cameras to be viewed with the HSTouch mobile app.

In March, HomeSeer released the model WFTT07 ''Control Pad'' free-standing 7" Android tabletop [[touchscreen]] embedded with their HSTouch mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-makes-a-tabletop-touchscreen-for-android-users/|title=HomeSeer Makes a Tabletop Smart Home Touchscreen for Android Users|publisher=Electronic House|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was designed to function as a WiFi connected control [[Web portal|portal]] for HomeSeer controllers.

In April, HomeSeer launched ''MyHomeSeer-Remote'' (''MyHS'') remote access web service for HS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_adds_cloud_service_to_home_automation_system/|title=HomeSeer Adds Cloud Service to Home Automation System|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MyHS simplified the process of enabling remote access to HomeSeer systems by eliminating the need to adjust [[Router (computing)|router]] settings or use [[DDNS]] technology. MyHS was also designed to optimize connection performance in the home by automatically providing a direct [[Local area network|LAN]] connection for users attempting to access their systems on the local [[Subnetwork|sub-net]].

In September, HomeSeer released their ''HomeTroller-SEL'' to replace the HomeTroller-SE as the company's mid-level controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-makes-new-hometroller-sel-home-controller-faster-and-more-affordab/|title=HomeSeer Makes New HomeTroller-SEL Home Controller Faster and More Affordable|publisher=Electronic House|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the [[Windows XP|WindowsXP]]-based SE, the new SEL model included a faster CPU, twice the [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and SSD storage, all running on a [[Debian]] distribution of [[Linux]].

Also in September, HomeSeer released their ''A2Z-Link'' Z-Wave bridge module and the ''HSM200'' Z-Wave multi-sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-puts-z-wave-into-2-new-home-automation-products/|title=HomeSeer Puts Z-Wave into 2 New Home Automation Products|publisher=Electronic House|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The A2Z-Link module was similar in design to the HomeTroller Zee but also included a newly developed [[Communications protocol|protocol]] to allow other controller manufacturers to communicate with Z-Wave devices using simple [[JSON]] or [[ASCII]] commands. A2Z-Link was conceived as an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] product; not intended for direct to consumer sales.
* The new HSM200 was [[Mains electricity|line-powered]], allowing the unit to function as a Z-Wave [[repeater]]. HSM200 also included an [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[LED]] indicator that could be controlled by HomeSeer systems to change colors when things happened in the home.

In November, the HomeTroller S6 becomes HomeSeer's new [[flagship]] home controller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-promises-efficient-home-automation-with-hometroller-s6/|title=HomeSeer Promises Efficient Home Automation with HomeTroller S6|publisher=Electronic House|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the PRO-100.

===2015===
In January 2015, HomeSeer released the Z-NET,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-z-net-can-combine-232-z-wave-home-automation-devices/|title=HomeSeer Z-NET Can Combine Up to 232 Z-Wave Home Automation Devices|publisher=Electronic House|last=Rachel|first=Cericola|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Internet Protocol|IP-enabled]] remote Z-Wave interface for use with its HS3-based systems. Since Z-NET works over a network connection, it can be placed nearly anywhere in the home and may also be used in outbuildings, vacation homes or other secondary residences.

In April, HomeSeer launched its [[IFTTT]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/enabling_richer_home_automation_through_limited_ifttt_smart_home_engine/|title=Enabling Richer Home Automation Through IFTTT Smart-Home Engine|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFTTT is a web service that allows users to create ''recipes'' that connect products, services and apps from more than 200 different companies around the world. The principal benefit of launching the channel is that it provides web-based integration for products, services and apps for which there are no native HomeSeer drivers (plug-ins). For example, a HomeSeer/IFTTT user could activate the [[ESPN]] sports network IFTTT channel and create a recipe to launch a HomeSeer event to turn on their TV and speak an alert when a sporting event begins.

In May, HomeSeer released its HomeTroller Zee S2 controller, based on the Raspberry Pi2 computer. Compared to the original Zee, the S2 model included a faster CPU, had twice the RAM and it included an internal [[Sigma Designs|Sigma]] 500 series Z-Wave module for native Z-Wave support. At the same time, several HomeSeer products underwent and achieved [http://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave_plus_certification/ Z-Wave Plus certification]. These products included HS3 software, HomeTroller Zee S2, HomeTroller-SEL, HomeTroller S6, Z-NET, SmartStick+ and A2Z-Link.

In December, HomeSeer released its Skill (app) for the [[Amazon Echo]]. The Skill allows HomeSeer users to control their systems by voice using the Amazon Echo.

===2016===
In March 2016, HomeSeer released a line of Z-Wave Plus lighting products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twice.com/news/home-automation/homeseer-adds-z-wave-plus-products/60922|title=HomeSeer Adds Z-Wave Plus Products|publisher=Twice.com|last=Palenchar|first=Joseph|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line included the HS-WS100+ wall switch, HS-WD100+ wall dimmer, HS-WA100+ wall accessory (for 3-way circuits), HS-PD100+ lamp module, HS-PA100+ appliance module and HS-DTA19+ smart light bulb.

== Compatible Technologies &amp; Products ==
Software is at the core of every system produced by HomeSeer. It's licensed as a stand-alone product (HS3) for users who wish to run it on their own personal computers. It's also pre-installed onto HomeTroller controllers, for users who prefer a more fully configured solution. In a typical installation, HS3 systems are connected to the users home network and may be programmed with any web browser. Once programming is complete, the HS3 system will carry out automation functions unattended. If desired, the HSTouch mobile app may be used to monitor and manually control the products in the home. HomeSeer's MyHS web service is designed to provide remote internet access only and is not required for processing of automation events in the home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">'''Kunyaza''' is the [[Rwanda-Rundi]] name given to a sexual practice found in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of [[East Africa]] which is meant to facilitate [[female orgasm]] during [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]].

==Terminology==
The Rwanda-Rundi word ''kunyaza'' is derived from the verb ''kunyaàra'', meaning "to urinate" but also signifying [[female ejaculation]] achieved by the practice.&lt;ref name=fusachi/&gt; It is known with various names in different regions, the regular Ugandan term being ''kakyabali'' (often ''kachabali'' in anglicised spelling) or "Western Jazz" in slang, due to its prevalence in western regions such as [[Ankole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weddingbells.co.ug/index.php/weddings-in-uganda/wedding-cultures/item/145-culture-pulling Culture of Pulling - Weddings in Uganda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415045101/http://weddingbells.co.ug/index.php/weddings-in-uganda/wedding-cultures/item/145-culture-pulling |date=2014-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic extent==
Kunyaza is present particularly in [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], western [[Uganda]], western [[Tanzania]], and eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name=bizimana&gt;[http://www.afrik-news.com/article14174.html Kunyaza, the secret to female orgasm], AfrikNews, 30 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey with Rwandan male respondents suggested that female [[Europe]]an visitors to the country are being introduced to the practice by local men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oxlund |first1=Bjarke |last2= |first2= |editor1-last=Barrett |editor1-first=Barbara Ann |editor2-last=Groes-Green |editor2-first=Christian |title=Studying Intimate Matters: Engaging Methodological Challenges in Studies on Gender, Sexuality and Reproductive Health in sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Fountain Publishers |date= |orig-year=1st pub. 2011 |pages=103 |chapter=Let's Talk About Sex: Comparing Notes from Qualitative Research on Men, Relationships and Sex in South Africa and Rwanda|chapterurl=|isbn=978-9970-02-999-0 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2010s, the practice saw spread through [[social media]] to [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/m/story.php?articleID=2000155361&amp;story_title=New-sex-craze-that-has-Nairobi-women-begging-for-more New sex craze that has Nairobi women begging for more], Standard Digital News, 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nairobiwire.com/2014/06/former-tv-presenter-offers-sex-advice-kenyan-ladies.html Former TV Presenter Offers Sex Advice To Kenyan Ladies], Nairobi Wire, 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kunyaza is usually considered a traditional practice in Rwanda and the folk tradition suggests that it dates back to the [[List of kings of Rwanda#3rd Dynasty|Third Dynasty]] rule. According to the lore, a royal guard the queen chose to have sex became very anxious and failed to penetrate the queen but instead, his [[penis]] rubbing against her [[labia minora|labia]] and [[clitoris]] gave satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/a-kunyara-primer.html|title=Kunyara|author=Matthew Stein|work=AskMen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formulated version of kunyaza was introduced to the Western public in books ''Weiblicher Orgasmus und weibliche Ejakulation dank afrikanischer Liebeskunst'' (2005) and ''Le secret de l’amour à l’africaine'' (2008) by [[Germany|German]]-based Rwandan traditional medicine specialist Nsekuye Bizimana.&lt;ref name=bizimana/&gt; A [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation of ''Le secret de l’amour à l’africaine'' was published in [[Hong Kong]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp1897.com.hk/product_info.php?BookId=9789861854496|title=非洲慾經|author=商務印書館|work=cp1897.com.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Kunyaza_phases.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Progressive non-penetrative (rubbing and tapping) and penetrative (thrusting and "screwing") phases of kunyaza.]]
Publicised by Dr. Nsekuye Bizimana as a secure means to achieve [[female orgasm]], often in the form of ejaculation, kunyaza involves a [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] and a penetrative phase in progression:

# The male partner first stimulates the [[labia minora]] of the female partner by tapping and also rubbing with his penis and then, at a certain level of arousal, proceeds to stimulate the internal surfaces of the labia minora and the [[vulval vestibule]], including the [[urinary meatus]] in the same manner, followed by stimulation of the [[clitoris]], vulval vestibule, labia minora and the vaginal opening.&lt;ref name="nsekuye bizimana"&gt;Dr. Nsekuye Bizimana, ''Kunyaza, a traditional sexual technique for triggering female orgasm at heterosexual encounters''. Sexologies (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hair removal|Removal]] of the female partner's [[pubic hair]] is advised for more comfortable manipulation of the penis.&lt;ref name="redpepper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.co.ug/kunyaza-sex-trick-that-trigger-womans-orgasm-in-five-minutes|title=Kunyaza, Sex Trick That Trigger Woman’s Orgasm In Five Minutes|work=Brian Kwesiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The male partner penetrates the vagina with alternating shallow thrusts (''gucuga'') at the vaginal opening with deep thrusts (''gucumita'') pushing against the [[cervix]] while maintaining exaggerated circular movements between [[vagina]] walls in a "screwing" fashion during penetration, often facilitating the movement by holding the penis between the middle and the index finger.&lt;ref name="nsekuye bizimana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebadamani.com/2/post/2013/07/kunyaza-an-afrika-sexual-technique.html|title=Kunyaza: An Afrikan Sexual Technique|work=Seba Damani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paroledafrique.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/le-kunyaza-une-methode-de-nos-ancetres-qui-fait-jouir-intensement-les-femmes-pendant-les-rapports/|title=Le kunyaza, une méthode de nos ancêtres qui fait jouir intensement les femmes pendant les rapports|work=PAROLE D'AFRIQUE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, other researchers emphasise that the version introduced by Dr. Bizimana diverts from the traditional kunyaza in fully omitting the [[labia elongation]] technique of ''gukuna'', which is in fact seen as integral to kunyaza.&lt;ref name=fusachi&gt;[http://gss.revues.org/2571?lang=en Plaisirs croisés : gukuna-kunyaza. Missions, corps et sexualités dans le Rwanda contemporain], Michela Fusaschi, ''Genre, sexualité &amp; société'', Autumn 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
As ''kunyaza'' involves some commitment of time, and, on the part of the man, restraint, it is posited as a relationship signifier.

'''Ludomusicology''' (also called '''video game music studies''' or '''video game music research''') is a field of academic research and scholarly analysis focusing on  [[video game music]], understood as the music found in [[video game]]s and in related contexts. It is closely related to the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Sound effect#Video games|interactive and games audio research]], and game music and audio are sometimes studied as a united phenomenon. Ludomusicology is also related to the field of [[game studies]], as music is one element of the wider video game text and some theories on video game functions are directly relevant to music.

Whereas the overarching areas of interactive and game audio research and game studies are highly interdisciplinary (ranging from [[Interface (computing)|interface]] research, [[Neurology|neurological research]], [[psychology]] and [[informatics]] to [[sound studies]], [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]]), ludomusicology as a subfield has been mainly driven by musicologists (albeit with an openness to interdisciplinary inquiry). Ludomusicology not only deals with music in games and music games as its subject matter, but is also interested in the ways in which games and their music have become subjects of playful engagement themselves, e.g. within the frame of fancultural practices. Additionally and more generally, game music challenges the ways in which we think about music, and subsequently how we study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Elferen|first1=Isabella|title=Ludomusicology and the new drastic (Conference paper, unpublished)|journal=Creativity, Circulation and Copyright: Sonic and Visual Media in the Digital Age|date=28–29 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|title=Playing Games with Music (and Vice Versa): Ludomusicological Perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of anthologies and monographs dealing with the specific subject of game music and music in game culture is steadily increasing. The ludomusicological community now organizes conferences, runs subgroups within the musicological societies, and engages in discourse with scholarly colleagues in a wide range of related fields.

==History==
Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthew|first1=Belinkie|title=Video game music: not just kid stuff|url=http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|website=Videogame Music Archive|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613143431/http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|archivedate=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed through the mid 2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen's article "Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music" which includes both).&lt;ref name="whalen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whalen|first1=Zach|date=November 2004|title=Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0401/whalen/|journal=Game Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of video game music is also known by some as "ludomusicology" — a portmanteau of "[[ludology]]" (the study of games and gameplay) and "[[musicology]]" (the study and analysis of music) — a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Cook|editor1-first=Nicholas|editor2-last=Pettengill|editor2-first=Richard|title=Taking it to the bridge: music as performance|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=283, 308|chapter=Playing games with music (and vice versa): ludomusicological perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karbani|first1=Tasneem|title=Summer research project was music to student's ears|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~publicas/folio/45/01/04.html|website=University of Alberta|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the [[University of Waterloo]] and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Collins|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/english/people-profiles/karen-collins|website=University of Waterloo|accessdate=2 May 2017|date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her monograph ''Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design'' (MIT Press 2008)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design|last1=Collins|first1=Karen|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262033787|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.

In 2012, the Ludomusicology Research Group held its inaugural conference at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was the first conference in the world to be focused specifically on video game music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014 the inaugural North American Conference on Video Game Music was held at [[Youngstown State University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both conferences have since been held annually, at varying locations in Europe and North America respectively.

In late 2016, the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg" /&gt; The SSSMG is the first international society dedicated to the study of video game music. In September 2017, the SSSMG announced the planned launch of a new journal dedicated to video game music and sound research, the ''Journal of Sound &amp; Music in Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/2017/09/04/announcement/|title=SSSMG Executive Committee Appointments &amp; Journal Announcement|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|date=4 September 2017|website=SSSMG|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of enquiry==
Ludomusicology examines any and all aspects of video game music and audio, some of which are described in brief here.

===Interactivity===
{{see also|Interactivity}}
Interactivity is one of the major differentiating qualities of video game music, distinguishing it from other screen media music through the incorporation of player actions. In interactive gameplay, the sound and music played by the game can respond to the actions of the player within the game.&lt;ref name="whalen" /&gt; Furthermore, as video games frequently feature non-linear or multi-linear timelines, their music can be similarly multi-threaded in both its form and its experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} Because each player takes an independently-chosen path through the game, any player’s experience of a game's music will be different (considered as a whole) to any other player's experience from the same game, even though constructed from the same basic elements. Therefore, the intent and output of the composer and the music's effect on the player (which similarly varies from player to player) must both be considered during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Iain|title=Meaningful Play: Performativity, Interactivity and Semiotics in Video Game Music|journal=Musicology Australia|date=2014|volume=36|issue=2|pages=273–290|doi=10.1080/08145857.2014.958272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept to that of interactivity is that of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]], which considers the ability of a video game to draw the player into a deep engagement with the game's diegetic space. Isabella van Elferen has developed a model of video game music immersion called "the ALI model", which understands player immersion to be a confluence of "musical affect, musical literacy and musical interaction":
* Affect: "personal investment in a given situation through memory, emotion and identification"
* Literacy: "fluency in hearing and interpreting... music through the fact of our frequent exposure to [it]", which builds on such literacy from other musical media
* Interaction: the player's reactions to music, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Isabella|first=van Elferen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=34–39|chapter=Analysing Game Musical Immersion: The ALI Model|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{see also|Video game music|Chiptune}}
Historical studies of video game music usually incorporate examinations of game music technology. Technological limitations of audio chips in early consoles and computer systems were, in many ways, instrumental in shaping the development of both the functions and aesthetics of game music. For example, Karen Collins describes how the [[Television Interface Adaptor|Television Interface Adapter]] in the [[Atari 2600]] created tones that could be out of tune by up to half a semitone; this led to minimal music in games for this platform, and substantial modifications to the music of ported games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|21–23}} Similarly, Melanie Fritsch observes the relative freedoms afforded to game composers by [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] (higher quality, though limited to 79.8 minutes) and later [[MP3]] (similar quality to CD audio but with compression minimising length restrictions), while also noting the challenges presented by writing increasingly detailed music to accompany hundreds of hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Fritsch|first=Melanie|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=24–25|chapter=History of Video Game Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technology that has attracted significant academic attention is [[iMUSE]], a [[MIDI]]-based system developed by [[LucasArts]] that allowed dynamic and smooth musical transitions, which were triggered by game conditions but which would occur at musically expedient (pre-designated) positions in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51–57}}

Ludomusicology also investigates muso-technological practices in fields surrounding video games. For example, scholarly attention is turning to [[chiptune]], which is the creation of music using old video game or sound chip hardware (a definition which is sometimes broadened to include the imitation of the resulting aesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Pasdzierny|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=174–175|chapter=Geeks on Stage? Investigations in the World of (Live) Chipmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
{{see also|Video game music}}
Ludomusicology examines the composition of video game music, both in relation to and as distinct from other forms of [[Musical composition|music composition]]. Studies of game music compositional processes are often contributed by active [[composer]]s and industry practitioners (for example, [[Winifred Phillips]]'s book ''A Composer's Guide to Game Music'', and [[Stephen Baysted]]'s chapter "Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' ''Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed''").&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Composer's Guide to Game Music|last=Phillips|first=Winifred|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Baysted|first=Stephen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=152–171|chapter=Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction of video game music composition is the need to incorporate the player's interactivity into the compositional process, and particularly as part of the negotiation of engagement and immersion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|35–36}} Composition is also at the nexus of creative potential and technological possibility, and throughout the development of game music (and particularly in its early phases) this has had significant effects on both compositional processes and game music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|35}}

===Music video games===

Music video games, which use music as part of a dominant gameplay mechanism, are a focus of many ludomusicological studies. The clear relationship between music and gameplay in games like the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' series facilitates the study of performance and performativity within gameplay, and provokes questions of musical ideology, performance practice and multimedia pedagogy. Kiri Miller writes that music video games feature a smaller disparity between the actions of player and avatar than is usually present in video games, and that this can encourage heightened levels of physical and musical engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Playing Along: Digital Games, YouTube, and Virtual Performance|last=Miller|first=Kiri|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Roesner, Anna Paisley, and Gianna Cassidy have examined these phenomena within the classroom context, observing that music video games can inspire not only musical creativity, but the positive self-perception of musicality in students; they suggest that such effects can be used to encourage student engagement and development within both musical and non-musical curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music Video Games: Performance, Politics, and Play|last=Roesner|first=David|last2=Paisley|first2=Anna|last3=Cassidy|first3=Gianna|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Austin|editor-first=Michael|location=New York|pages=213–215|chapter=Guitar Heroes in the Classroom: The Creative Potential of Music Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to music in other screen media===
{{see also|Soundtrack|Film score}}
Because video games are (usually) screen-based media, there are strong links between the study of game music and the study of music in other screen-based media (like film and television). Concepts such as [[Diegesis#In film|diegesis]] and [[Acousmatic sound|acousmatics]], which originate in film and film audio studies, are broadly applicable to video game music analyses, often with minimal adjustment.&lt;ref name=whalen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medina-Gray|first1=Elizabeth|editor1-last=Donnelly|editor1-first=K.J.|editor2-last=Gibbons|editor2-first=William|editor3-last=Lerner|editor3-first=Neil|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=Meaningful Modular Combinations: Simultaneous Harp and Environmental Music in two ''Legend of Zelda'' Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are similarities between video game and film music techniques as varying stages throughout video game music history. For example, Neil Lerner notes a relationship between music in [[Silent film|early/silent cinema]] and game music aesthetics from the 1970s onwards, on the basis of "largely nonverbal communication system[s]" and "continuous musical accompaniment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|last=Lerner|first=Neil|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Donnelly|editor-first=K.J.|location=New York|pages=12|chapter=Mario's Dynamic Leaps: Musical Innovations (and the Specter of Early Cinema) in ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Super Mario Bros.''|editor-last2=Gibbons|editor-first2=William|editor-last3=Lerner|editor-first3=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Gregor Herzfeld compares the use of high energy music in ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' to the use of rock music in action films like ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', due to associations with risky and/or exciting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Herzfeld|first=Gregor|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also well noted within ludomusicological discourse that video games are very different media to film and television due to the player's interaction. Consequently, the application of concepts like diegesis does require a nuanced approach that takes the peculiarities of the video game medium into account. For example, Collins observes that linear approaches to [[musical analysis]] (such as the observation of synchronicity between musical and visual cues) fail to address the non-linear timescales that are typical of video games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} This forms a basis of Collins's reiteration of a warning by video game theorists against "theoretical imperialism".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|5}}

===Research methods===
Several academics have written about the research methods involved in ludomusicology. One of the more comprehensive of these studies is found in Tim Summers's book ''Understanding Video Game Music'', in which Summers describes the process of "analytical play", wherein the analyst is "deliberately subverting the game's expectations of the player's actions.... At moments when game rules are tested, the architecture is often clearest. By playing experimentally (or using 'analytical play') to investigate the musical system in the game and comparing multiple play sessions, the musical mechanics of the game programming can be divined".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|35}} Summers places this analytical method alongside more conventional sources of research data, both from inside the game (e.g., programmatic and musical information, the latter of which frequently involves the application of conventional musicology and music theory to the video game music text) and from texts and communities surrounding the game.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|34–50}}

==Groups and Conferences==

===Ludomusicology Research Group===
The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/about/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludo 2017|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/past-events/ludo-2017/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ludo2018 held in Leipzig, Germany, in April 2018, was the biggest Ludo-conference so far, attracting more than 80 participants from all over the world. The group was originally founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled ''Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music'', published in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kamp|editor1-first=Michiel|editor2-last=Summers|editor2-first=Tim|editor3-last=Sweeney|editor3-first=Mark|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Equinox|isbn=9781781791974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludomusicology|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/ludomusicology/|website=Equinox|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also edited a double special issue of [https://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2999/ ''The Soundtrack''] and initiated a new book series called [http://www.ludomusicology.org/2017/04/20/new-book-series-studies-game-sound-music/ ''Studies in Game Sound and Music''] in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers' book ''Understanding Video Game Music'' was published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Tim|title=Understanding Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107116870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal [http://www.act.uni-bayreuth.de/en/archiv/2011-02/index.html ''ACT - Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance''], published in July 2011 that included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven Reale and James Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in Musicology, Fritsch has her background in Performance Studies. Her doctoral thesis and first monograph "Performing Bytes. Musikperformances der Computerspielkultur" is scheduled for publication during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://uni-bayreuth.academia.edu/mfritsch&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM)===
The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, B. I. (2014, January 18). [https://www.wired.com/2014/01/game-music/  There Really Is a Conference Where Nerds Study Videogame Music.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Checkpoint!: The floodgates have opened.

===Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG)===
In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SSSMG|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/about-sssmg/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field's understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its initial focus is the use of its website as a "hub" for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/bibliography/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMS Ludomusicology Study Group===
The Ludomusicology Study Group of the [[American Musicological Society]] was founded in 2015 and "is dedicated to facilitating academic research on music interactive media", including holding a panel on video game music as part of the annual meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamemusicstudies.org/?page_id=12|title=About|work=Ludomusicology Study Group|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludomusicology Society of Australia (LSA)===
The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to "offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LSA is here!|url=http://ludomusicologysociety.com.au/2017/03/07/hello-world/|website=The Ludomusicology Society of Australia|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modified Active Gas Sampling''' (MAGS) is an [[environmental engineering]] assessment technique which rapidly detects unsaturated [[soil]] source areas impacted by [[volatile organic compounds]]. The technique was developed by [[HSA Engineers &amp; Scientists]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] in 2002, led by Richard Lewis, Steven Folsom, and Brian Moore. It is being used all over the [[United States]], and has been adopted by the state of [[Florida]] in its Dry-cleaning Solvent Cleanup Program.&lt;ref name="ebiusa.com"&gt;[http://www.ebiusa.com/EBJAwards.html 2007 EBJ Business Achievement Awards – Winners, Environmental Business Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
MAGS involves the extraction and analysis of soil vapor from a piezometer screened through the unsaturated soil column for the purpose of locating unsaturated zone source material.  According to the MAGS Manual, written by HSA and adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, MAGS is performed "by utilizing a typical regenerative blower fitted to a temporary [[soil vapor extraction]] well, [such that]a large volume of soil can be assessed with a limited number of samples.  While lacking the resolution of traditional soil sampling methods (e.g., discrete soil sampling, low flow active gas sampling, etc.), the statistical representativeness (in the sense of sample coverage) of MAGS results versus traditional methods is much greater.  Moreover, the results of the assessment provide useful transport and exposure assessment information over traditional techniques.  Lastly, MAGS is effective as both an initial site assessment and remedial assessment tool, in that, MAGS directly yields data required for remedial design."&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.dep.state.fl.us/pub/reports/wc/hsa/mags.pdf Modified Active Gas Sampling Manual, Florida Department of Environmental Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

MAGS is an alternative to discrete and composite [[soil test|soil sampling]]. MAGS, while it does not describe the sample with as much precision as the previously mentioned sampling methods, is more powerful statistically: it represents a larger area of a site which is more useful in determining the presence of a compound. Besides increasing the accuracy in identifying the presence compounds in the soil, MAGS also can quickly and accurately narrow down the location and spread of the compounds after a few trials. Once the location has been determined, more thorough and traditional soil borings can be done in the identified location, instead of sampling a whole site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broward.org/PollutionPrevention/ContaminatedSites/Documents/RemediationTimesArchive/NovemberDecember2002.pdf Broward Environmental Remediation Times, November/December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

HSA found particular success using the technique at solvent-impacted sites that were showing signs of rebound after initial remediation efforts. These rebounds are commonly the result of multiple (relatively small) release areas that had not been previously discovered with discrete soil sampling. MAGS can be useful in detecting how effectively the site had been cleaned up post-remediation.&lt;ref name="Poison Detective"&gt;[http://www.review.net/section/detail/poison-detective/ "Poison Detective," Gulf Coast Business Review, 2009 December 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding==
HSA Engineers &amp; Scientists considered patenting MAGS technology, but decided to trademark MAGS instead, asking that those who use the technique credit the firm.&lt;ref name="Poison Detective"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2009, HSA was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal with a Technology Merit Award in the category of remediation for the invention of MAGS technology.&lt;ref name="ebiusa.com"/&gt;

'''Morphing''' is a [[special effect]] in [[film|motion pictures]] and [[animation]]s that changes (or morphs) one [[image]] or shape into another through a seamless transition. morphing means stretching or as part of a fantasy or surreal sequence. Traditionally such a depiction would be achieved through cross-fading techniques on film. Since the early 1990s, this has been replaced by computer software to create more realistic transitions.

==Early transformation techniques==
Long before digital morphing several techniques were used for similar image transformations. Some are closer to a matched dissolve - a gradual change between two pictures without warping the shapes in the images - while others did change the shapes in between the start and end phases of the transformation.

===Tabula scalata===
Known since at least the end of the 16th century, [[Tabula scalata]] is a type of painting with two images divided over a corrugated surface. Each image is only correctly visible from a certain angle. If the pictures are matched properly a primitive type of morphing effect occurs when changing from one viewing angle to the other.

===Mechanical transformations===
Around 1790 French [[shadow play]] showman [[François Dominique Séraphin]] used a metal shadow figure with jointed parts to have the face of a young woman changing into that of a witch.&lt;ref&gt;https://filslisibles.blogspot.nl/2015/05/le-cinema-avant-le-cinema-1-theatre.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 19th century mechanical [[magic lantern]] slides produced changes to the appearance of figures. For instance a nose could grow to enormous size, simply by slowly sliding away a piece of glass with black paint that masked part of another glass plate with the picture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/wipwaps06_uk.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdcmuseum.org.uk/explore/item/64097/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matched dissolves===
In the first half of the 19th century "[[dissolving views]]" were a popular type of magic lantern show, mostly showing landscapes gradually dissolving from a day to night version or from summer to winter. Other uses are known, for instance Henry Langdon Childe showed groves transforming into cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|title=The Spectator|date=1835-07-18|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/18th-july-1835/13/the-colosseum|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910 short film ''Narren-grappen'' shows a [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] transformation of the clothing of a female character.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRLaG1TYakY&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL7R2kkNY-OHggGsxTF5cXyP6UUI_P92zj&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Tourneur]]'s 1915 film [[Alias Jimmy Valentine (1915 film)|Alias Jimmy Valentine]] featured a subtle dissolve transformation of the main character from respected citizen Lee Randall into his criminal alter ego Jimmy Valentine.

''The Peter Tchaikovsky Story'' in a 1959 TV-series episode of ''Disneyland'' features a swan automaton transforming into a real ballet dancer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZQr0DUf3uM&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL7R2kkNY-OHggGsxTF5cXyP6UUI_P92zj&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Godley &amp; Creme]] created a "morph" effect using analogue cross-fades on parts of different faces in the video for "[[Cry (Godley &amp; Creme song)|Cry]]".

===Animation===
In animation the effect was created long before the invention of film. A [[phenakistiscope]] designed by its inventor [[Joseph Plateau]] and/or painter [[Jean-Baptiste Madou]] was printed around 1835 and shows the head of a woman changing into a witch and then into a monster.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOTP9bYRRrY&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL7R2kkNY-OHggGsxTF5cXyP6UUI_P92zj&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Émile Cohl]]'s 1908 animated film ''Fantasmagorie'' featured much morphing of characters and objects drawn in simple outlines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1d28X0lkJ4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital morphing==
[[File:Morphvideo-ape-bird-april12-2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1|An animated example of an ape morphing into a bird.]]
In the early 1990s computer techniques that often produced more convincing results began to be widely used. These involved distorting one image at the same time that it faded into another through marking corresponding points and vectors on the "before" and "after" images used in the morph. For example, one would morph one face into another by marking key points on the first face, such as the contour of the nose or location of an eye, and mark where these same points existed on the second face. The computer would then distort the first face to have the shape of the second face at the same time that it faded the two faces. To compute the transformation of image coordinates required for the distortion, the [[Beier-Neely Morphing Algorithm|algorithm of Beier and Neely]] can be used.

===Early examples===
Though the 1986 movie ''[[The Golden Child]]'' implemented very crude morphing effects from animal to human and back, the first movie to employ detailed morphing was the spaceship changing shape in ''Flight of the Navigator'' in 1986, followed by ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'', in 1988. A similar process was used a year later in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' to create Walter Donovan's gruesome demise. Both effects were created by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] using grid [[image warping|warping]] techniques developed by [[Tom Brigham]] and [[Doug Smythe]] ([[AMPAS]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwdb.oscars.org/ampas/plsql/ampas_search.main?free_text_in=TOM%20BRIGHAM%20 AMPAS - Index of Motion Picture Credits - Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover for [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' featured the technique to morph the four band members' faces into one [[wiktionary:Gestalt|gestalt]] still image. 

In 1991, morphing appeared notably in the [[Michael Jackson]] music video "[[Black or White]]" and in the movies ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''. The first application for personal computers to offer morphing was [[Gryphon Software Morph]] on the [[Macintosh]]. Other early morphing systems included ImageMaster, MorphPlus and CineMorph, all of which premiered for the [[Commodore Amiga]] in 1992. Other programs became widely available within a year, and for a time the effect became common to the point of [[cliché]].  For high-end use, [[Elastic Reality]] (based on MorphPlus) saw its first feature film use in ''In The Line of Fire'' (1993) and was used in [[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]] (work performed by the Post Group).  At [[VisionArt]] Ted Fay used Elastic Reality to morph [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.  Elastic Reality was later purchased by [[Avid Technology|Avid]], having already become the de facto system of choice, used in many hundreds of films. The technology behind Elastic Reality earned two Academy Awards in 1996 for Scientific and Technical Achievement going to Garth Dickie and [[Perry Kivolowitz]]. The effect is technically called a "spatially warped cross-dissolve".  The first social network designed for user-generated morph examples to be posted online was Galleries by [[Morpheus (morphing software)]].

In Taiwan, Aderans, a hair loss solutions provider, did a TV commercial featuring a morphing sequence in which people with lush, thick hair morph into one another, reminiscent of the end sequence of the "[[Black or White]]" video.

===Present use===
Morphing algorithms continue to advance and programs can automatically morph images that correspond closely enough with relatively little instruction from the user. This has led to the use of morphing techniques to create convincing slow-motion effects where none existed in the original film or video footage by morphing between each individual frame using [[optical flow]] technology.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Morphing has also appeared as a transition technique between one scene and another in television shows, even if the contents of the two images are entirely unrelated. The algorithm in this case attempts to find corresponding points between the images and distort one into the other as they crossfade.

While perhaps less obvious than in the past, morphing is used heavily today.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Whereas the effect was initially a novelty, today, morphing effects are most often designed to be seamless and invisible to the eye.

A particular use for morphing effects is modern digital font design. Using morphing technology, called interpolation or [[multiple master fonts|multiple master]] tech, a designer can create an intermediate between two styles, for example generating a semibold font by compromising between a bold and regular style, or extend a trend to create an ultra-light or ultra-bold. The technique is commonly used by font design studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riggs|first1=Tamye|title=The Adobe Originals Silver Anniversary Story|url=http://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/30/the-adobe-originals-silver-anniversary-story-how-the-originals-endured-in-an-ever-changing-industry/|website=Typekit blog|publisher=Adobe|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment in 1958, NASA has conducted research on a range range of topics. Because of its unique structure, work happens at various 'centers of excellence' and different research areas are concentrated in those centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/plans/99nsp/9.html|title=3|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the technology, hardware and expertise needed, research may be conducted across a range of centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/strahand/roles.htm|title=NASA Strategic Management Handbook|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the research conducted by the United States space agency include:

A variety of large-scale medical studies are being conducted in space by the [[National Space Biomedical Research Institute]] (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study, in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. Usually there is no physician on board the International Space Station, and [[Medical treatment during spaceflight|diagnosis of medical conditions]] is challenging. Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including [[decompression sickness]], barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, [[Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight|sleep disturbances]], and radiation injury. [[Ultrasound]] offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |title=NASA—Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |publisher=NASA |date=July 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rao |first1=S |last2=Van Holsbeeck |first2=L|last3=Musial|first3=JL|last4=Parker|first4=A|last5=Bouffard|first5=JA|last6=Bridge|first6=P|last7=Jackson|first7=M|last8=Dulchavsky|first8=SA|title=A pilot study of comprehensive ultrasound education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine: a pioneer year review|journal=Journal of ultrasound in medicine|volume=27|issue=5|pages=745–9|date=2008|pmid=18424650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fincke|first1=E.

It helps to ensure that NASA meets its federal stewardship responsibilities for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oim.hq.nasa.gov/oia/emd/energy.html|title=Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation|accessdate=May 1, 2008|publisher=NASA|date=2007|author=Tina Norwood|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117130103/http://oim.hq.nasa.gov/oia/emd/energy.html |archivedate= January 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earth science==
[[File:ISS-38 Hawaiian Island chain.jpg|thumb|right|Earth from the International Space Station]]

Understanding of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment (such as [[global warming]]) is the main objective of NASA's [[Earth science]]. NASA currently has more than a dozen Earth science spacecraft/instruments in orbit studying all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere, [[biosphere]], [[cryosphere]]), with several more planned for launch in the next few years.&lt;ref name="Climate Change: NASA's Role"&gt;{{cite news |title= Taking a global perspective on Earth's climate|publisher=Global Climate Change: NASA's Eyes on the Earth |url= https://climate.nasa.gov/NasaRole/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230304/https://climate.nasa.gov/NasaRole/ |archivedate= July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth science research program was created and funded in the 1980s under the administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W.

NASA is working in cooperation with [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL). The goal is to produce worldwide solar resource maps with great local detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/33792.pdf|title=Progress on Updating the 1961–1990 National Solar Radiation Database|accessdate=May 1, 2008|publisher=NREL|date=2003|author=D.

On April 6, 1999, the agency signed The [[Memorandum of Agreement]] (MOA) along with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]], and [[USAF]] authorizing all the above organizations to conduct necessary tests at the John F. Kennedy Space center. The main purpose was to evaluate two innovative in-situ remediation technologies, thermal removal and oxidation destruction of DNAPLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/137b08f43cc2197e8525674e005f76fd?OpenDocument|title=EPA, DOE, NASA AND USAF Evaluate Innovative Technologies|accessdate=April 28, 2008|publisher=EPA|date=1999|author=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Space Agency made a partnership with Military Services and [[Defense Contract Management Agency]] named the "Joint Group on Pollution Prevention".

===Ozone depletion===
In 1975, NASA was directed by legislation to research and monitor the upper atmosphere. This led to Upper Atmosphere Research Program and later the [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) satellites in the 1990s to monitor [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph38.pdf |title= NASA and the Environment: The Case of Ozone Depletion |publisher= NASA |date= May 2005 |author= W.

The '''Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service''' ({{lang-fr|Service hydrographique et océanographique de la Marine}} or SHOM) is a French public establishment of an administrative nature ({{lang-fr|[[établissement public à caractère administratif]]}}) administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]].  It is the successor to the Dépôt des cartes et plans de la Marine, founded in 1720 which became the Naval Hydrographic Service in 1886 and the Naval and Oceanographic Service in 1971. Its present form was set up by decree number 2007-800 on 11 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=DEFD0750453D Decree number 2007-800 of 11 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its board is presided over by the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]] ({{lang-fr|Chef d'État-Major de la Marine}}) and the body is directed by a director-general.

== Aims ==

This public body has several aims, including the provision of :
* a public service in [[hydrography]] and maritime [[cartography]], including the collection, elaboration, confirmation and spread of nautical information useful to civil or naval navigators and to all who sail for professional or pleasure, as well as those responsible for care of the coast
* to support the navy's hydrographers, [[oceanographer]]s and [[meteorologist]]s concerning specific information on maritime matters to ensure the optimal running of the navy's weapons systems (radar, sonar, infra-red sensors, carrier-borne aircraft etc.).

SHOM is made up of oceanographic and hydrographic groups, as well as a school, and employs 500 naval and civil personnel.  Its fleets consists of 5 boats: the [[French ship Beautemps-Beaupré (2002)|''Beautemps-Beaupré'']], the ''Borda'', the ''La Pérouse'', the ''Laplace'' and the ''[[Pourquoi-Pas ? (2005)|Pourquoi-Pas ?]]''.  SHOM works in cooperation with many other national organisations, including [[IFREMER]] (with whom it shares the ''Pourquoi-Pas ?''), [[Météo-France]], the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], the [[University of Western Brittany]] and the [[Institut géographique national (France)|IGN]].

It participates in international hydrographic projects and programmes co-ordinated by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]], of which France is a member.

== Publications ==
Among the SHOM's nautical publications are
*[[maritime chart]]s in paper or electronic form ("cartes électroniques de navigation" or ENC)

'''Neo-conceptual art''' describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the [[conceptual art]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  These subsequent initiatives have included the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], United States neo-conceptualists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and the [[Young British Artists]], notably [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is also a [[Stuckism]] counter-movement and criticism from the 1970s conceptual art group [[Art and Language]].

==History==

[[File:Neon-bolognini.JPG|thumb|right|170 px|[[Maurizio Bolognini]]'s ''Programmed Machines'' (''Sealed'')  hundreds of computers are programmed to generate endless flows of random images which nobody would see. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many of the concerns of the "conceptual art" movement proper have been taken up by many contemporary artists since the initial wave of conceptual artists. While many of these artists may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, [[digital art]], and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[computer art]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art]]. Many critics and artists may speak of conceptual aspects of a given artist or art work, reflecting the enduring influence that many of the original conceptual artists have had on the art world.

==New York City==
The idea of neo-conceptual art (sometimes later termed [[post-conceptual art]]) in the United States was clearly articulated by [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] (working as a team called: Collins &amp; Milazzo) in the early 1980s in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/arts/art-now-on-view-new-work-by-freelance-curators.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ART; Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators]&lt;/ref&gt; when they brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists through their copious writings and curatorial activity. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of neo (or post) conceptual art; one that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DAN+CAMERON+ON+Collins+%26+Milazzo.-a057475774] DAN CAMERON ON Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what some of the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together: artists such as [[Ross Bleckner]], [[James Welling]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jonathan Lasker]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Robert Gober]] and [[Saint Clair Cemin]].

==Moscow==
The [[Moscow Conceptualists]], in the 1970s and 80s, attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]]. The central figures were [[Ilya Kabakov]] and [[Komar and Melamid]]. The group also included [[Eric Bulatov]] and [[Viktor Pivovarov]].

==London==
The [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work was described at the time as neo-conceptual,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lash and Celia Lury, ''Global Culture Industries: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p211. {{ISBN|0-7456-2483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression. Charles Harrison, a member of the conceptual art group [[Art and Language]] in the 1970s, criticizes the neo-conceptual art of the 1990s as conceptual art "without threat or awkwardness"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p29. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "vacant" prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p241. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists associated with neo-conceptualism in the UK include [[Martin Creed]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Bethan Huws]], [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]], [[Simon Starling]] and [[Douglas Gordon]].

==Notable events==
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the UK==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the rise to prominence of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs) after the 1988 ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'' show, curated by Damien Hirst, and subsequent promotion of the group by the [[Saatchi Gallery]] during the 1990s, generated a media backlash, where the phrases "conceptual art" and "neo-conceptual" came to be terms of derision applied to much [[contemporary art]]. This was amplified  by the [[Turner Prize]] whose more extreme nominees (most notably Hirst and Emin) caused a controversy annually.

[[File:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo (3).jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "Death of Conceptual Art" coffin demonstration, 2002]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002 deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube Demo 2002"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 19 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They staged yearly demonstrations outside the Turner Prize.

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]] (an art school graduate) denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/01/nart01.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed  April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA collection.

'''Night combat''' is [[combat]] that occurs during the hours of darkness.  It is distinguished from daytime combat by lower visibility and its reversed relation to the [[Circadian cycle]].  Typically combat at night is favorable to the attacker, with offensive tactics being focused on exploiting the advantages to maximum effect.&lt;ref name="NCBRC"&gt;[http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ntcombat/index.html NIGHT COMBAT BY RUSSIAN CAVALRY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toppe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zW63yXqltbEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=night+combat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ncBHnD-qS0&amp;sig=sT1_TdCa8WT9bpP8vLxEeD43k_4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H9n7SvWXKoHiswPBioB5&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Night Combat]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defensive night tactics mainly focus on negating the advantages given by the night to the attacker.&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;[http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/morris/morris.asp#7 Night Combat Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of night==
The most obvious effect of darkness is reduced [[visibility]].  This affects a soldier's ability to observe friendly troop movements, understand terrain, and especially affects perception of enemy movements and position.  Officers find that darkness hampers many aspects of command, including their ability to preserve control, execute movement, firing, maintenance of direction, reconnaissance, security, and mutual support. A [[U.S. Army]] report on historic Japanese warfare described an instance of this confusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An example is recorded in the history of Japan when about 1180 a force[sic] of the Heike confronting a force of the Genji across the Fuji river (Shizuoka Prefecture) beat a hasty retreat one night due to mistaking the noise made by water fowl for an attacking Genji force.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, a side effect of the reduced visibility is heightened audibility, as soldiers focus more on what they can hear.  There are many instances of soldiers losing their bearings at night due to flashes from guns or enemy searchlights.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/33825657/Japanese-Night-Combat-Part-1-Principles-of-Night-Combat-USA-1955 Eight United States Army Military History Section: Japanese Research Division]&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties of perception lend themselves to fear of the unknown.  Soldiers under fire can't tell where the fire originates and can't devise appropriate countermeasures.  Such uncertainty is associated with feelings of loneliness and helplessness, and creates a tendency to over estimate enemy strength or be excessively pessimistic of the combat situation.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat" /&gt;

In addition, without the aid of artificial illumination, a soldier's marksmanship skills are negatively affected in total darkness. "Prior to the introduction of aided night vision devices, effective firing at night with a rifle was limited to very close distances, typically within 50 meters. The ability to hit targets was dependant upon a soldiers ability to acquire targets in their sights, which in turn, depended greatly upon the amount of natural and artificial illumination." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a297284.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Night operations have been subject to vast shifts in effectiveness and frequency throughout history, as tactics and technology became more sophisticated.

===Classical antiquity===
Night fighting between [[Standing army|standing armies]] was rare in ancient times.  Night logistics were mostly limited to the carrying of torches, or navigation by what little light was provided by the stars or moon.  However, circumstances occasionally necessitated fighting at night.  Usually due to the massive nature of the battles, they could not be resolved in one day, and combat could not be cleanly disengaged as darkness fell, or prevented as armies camped near each other overnight.{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} [[Sieges]] which lasted for weeks, months or, even years were often fought day and night. Below are a few notable examples.

Ancient historian [[Diodorus]] claims that at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] the Spartans attempted to assassinate Persian King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] by infiltrating his camp at night.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They immediately seized their arms, and six hundred men rushed into the camp of five hundred thousand, making directly for the king's tent, and resolving either to die with him, or, if they should be overpowered, at least in his quarters. An alarm spread through the whole Persian army. The Spartans being unable to find the king, marched uncontrolled through the whole camp, killing and overthrowing all that stood in their way, like men who knew that they fought, not with the hope of victory, but to avenge their own deaths. The contest was protracted from the beginning of the night through the greater part of the following day. At last, not conquered, but exhausted with conquering, they fell amidst vast heaps of slaughtered enemies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/warsbattles/a/Thermopylae.htm Diodorus on the Battle of Thermopylae]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], over a period of 3 days, an alliance of Germanic tribes wore down and eventually annihilated 3 Roman legions (about 16,000 to 20,000 men).  The Romans attempted several defensive night tactics.  On the first night they managed to erect a fortified camp.  On the second night, they marched at night in an attempt to break through the encircling Germanic forces, but the Germans had already built a wall in their way, and when combat resumed the following day, the Romans were defeated.

The [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] saw exceptional chaos caused by nightfall.  The night before the battle proper, one of the Roman allied forces stumbled on a band of Hunnic troops and in the resulting skirmish, as many as 30,000 (unverified) men were killed.  Later in the battle,  [[Thorismund]], son of king [[Theodoric I|Theodoric]], accidentally walked into [[Attila the Hun]]'s encampment while attempting to return to his own forces at night.  He was wounded in the ensuing mêlée before his followers could rescue him and withdraw.  That same night, the Roman commander [[Flavius Aëtius]] became separated from his men and, believing that disaster had befallen them, had to stay the night with his Germanic allies.

===Middle Ages===
[[The Night Attack]] of [[Târgovişte]] pitted [[Vlad The Impaler]] of [[Wallachia]] against [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  Vlad reportedly disguised himself as a Turk and walked freely throughout the Ottoman camp in an effort to find the Mehmed's tent and learn about the organization of his army.  One chronicle of the battle says that Mehmed disallowed his troops to exit their tents so as not to cause a panic in case of an attack.  According to that chronicle, Vlad learned of this and planned his attack at night knowing that the enemy soldiers would have to remain in their tents.  Accounts of the battle and its casualties are mixed, but in the end it was a Wallachian victory, with around 5000 Wallachian casualties compared to around 15,000 for the Ottomans.

===World War I===
The adoption of illumination rounds led to an improvement in the ability to carry out night operations. These projectiles were fired from howitzers and field guns in the direction their light was required. The first illumination rounds (also called [[Shell (projectile)|starshell]]) were modified shrapnel shells which ejected magnesium pellets. These were somewhat ineffective, and were soon replaced by improved designs that had greater candle power, and a parachute to prolong the descent to ground. Tracer ammunition was also introduced during World War I. Tracers made marksmanship at night easier for soldiers, because they could observe the trajectory of their shots and correct their aim accordingly.

===World War II===
{{see also|Night fighter}}
Night continued to have a significant impact on combat during [[World War II]]. Particularly in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], the Japanese military was proficient in night warfare, as acknowledged by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In anticipation of a conflict with the Soviet Union, whose numbers of tanks, planes, and artillery were vastly superior, the Japanese developed a series of training manuals designed to counter these advantages. The "Red Books" (classified materials bound in red paper) emphasized the advantages of attacking at night, in the evening, and at dawn. These tactics later proved useful against the Allies who were similarly better equipped.

The Japanese used this advantage to win engagements where they were severely outnumbered in China and against the Allies at sea. It wasn't until late in the war that early warning technologies of the Allies subverted their surprise attacks at night, reducing their effectiveness. These tactics completely broke down once the Japanese military replaced their well trained troops with hastily trained recruits.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat" /&gt; The [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] was the first [[aircraft carrier]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] that carried out night strike operations. It received the new designation (CV(N)-6), the "N" standing for "Night", to indicate this capability.

Another type of illumination device was the [[tripflare]]. This consisted of a pyrotechnic instrument activated by a tripwire, which was planted near trails to provide early warning of enemy movement. By 1944, the Wehrmacht was making extensive use of tripflares in Italy, after their perimeters had been repeatedly infiltrated at night by U.S. Army Rangers. Tripflares helped foil an attack launched by the [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] on January 20 at the Rapido Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World War II River Assault Tactics |year=2013 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=9781780961088 |pages=59 |author=Gordon L. Rottman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
In the [[First Battle of al-Faw]] in late stages of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], one of the elements contributed to the success of Iranians was their using of dug in infantry which would move only at night and during poor weather, which reduced the Iraqis' advantage in armor. The Iranian forces had been trained in night warfare prior to the battle.

==Tactics==
Perhaps the most important deciding factor in a battle at night is preparation.  This includes [[Military education and training|training]], [[Reconnaissance#Military reconnaissance|reconnaissance]], and [[Military operation plan|planning]].  As with any military operation, leadership is important in both the high-ranking officers and the low-level squad and unit leaders.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt;

===Offensive tactics===
The decision to engage at night or continue an engagement at night is usually made by the attacking force.  Combat continued at night is aimed at exploiting an advantage gained from an attack during the day or similarly denying the defending force the opportunity to regroup or reinforce.  Combat initiated at night can either be aimed to gain an advantage (such as territory or prisoners) which is then held during the following day or to harass and demoralize the enemy before disengaging prior to sunrise.  The latter case is considered a [[Raid (military)|raid]].

Historically, night combat involves greater risk and reward compared to similar battles in the day time.  Victories can be crushing, with the defending side taken completely by surprise and hardly a shot fired in response to an attack.  Alternatively, defeats can be disastrous with huge casualties resulting from attacking armies floundering around chaotically while they themselves are ambushed in pitch darkness.

The '''observable universe''' is a [[celestial sphere|spherical region]] of the [[Universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' &lt; 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice et al |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the Universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]].

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the Universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

Since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future, the light emitted from all distant objects, past some time dependent on their current [[redshift]], will never reach the Earth. In the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.&lt;ref name=Loeb2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will ''never'' enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse2"&gt;The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in principle more galaxies will become observable in the future, in practice an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely [[redshift]]ed due to ongoing expansion, so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Krauss|first = Lawrence M.|author2=Robert J.

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared. The entire universe will disappear before our very eyes, and it's one of my arguments for actually funding cosmology. We've got to do it while we have a chance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Faster than light#Universal expansion]] and [[Future of an expanding universe#Galaxies outside the Local Supercluster are no longer detectable]].&lt;/ref&gt; An additional subtlety is that a galaxy at a given comoving distance is defined to lie within the "observable universe" if we can receive signals emitted by the galaxy at any age in its past history (say, a signal sent from the galaxy only 500 million years after the Big Bang), but because of the universe's expansion, there may be some later age at which a signal sent from the same galaxy can ''never'' reach the Earth at any point in the infinite future (so, for example, we might never see what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years after the Big Bang),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Loeb|first = Abraham|title = The Long-Term Future of Extragalactic Astronomy|journal = Physical Review D|volume = 65|issue = 4|date = 2002|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65d7301L }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it remains at the same comoving distance (comoving distance is defined to be constant with time—unlike proper distance, which is used to define recession velocity due to the expansion of space), which is less than the comoving radius of the observable universe.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} This fact can be used to define a type of cosmic [[event horizon]] whose distance from the Earth changes over time. For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Dynamics of the Universe and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking" Kazanas, D., Ap. J. (Lett.), 241, L59-L63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times the radius of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is ''smaller'' than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html "Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redshift survey|Sky surveys]] and mappings of the various [[wavelength]] bands of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (in particular [[Hydrogen line|21-cm emission]]) have yielded much information on the content and character of the [[universe]]'s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] model with organization up to the [[scale (spatial)|scale]] of [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filament]]s. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|page=1178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the ''End of Greatness''.&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt;

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===
[[File:2dfdtfe.gif|thumb|300px|left|[[Dtfe|DTFE reconstruction]] of the inner parts of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]]]]
The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address [[astrophysics]] on that scale. [[Star]]s are organized into [[galaxy|galaxies]], which in turn form [[galaxy group]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s, sheets, [[galaxy filament|walls and filaments]], which are separated by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]], creating a vast foam-like structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–1174|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called the "cosmic web". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that [[virial theorem|virialized]] galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the "[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]",&lt;ref name="redshift"&gt;{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.

Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the [[Huge-LQG]], was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, astronomers discovered the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]],&lt;ref name=2014paper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horváth |first1=I |last2=Hakkila |first2=Jon |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. | title = Possible structure in the GRB sky distribution at redshift two | date = 2014 |arxiv=1401.0533 |bibcode=2014A&amp;A...561L..12H |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201323020 |volume=561 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages=L12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite arXiv |last = Horvath |first = I. |last2= Hakkila |first2=J. |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. |title = The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts |date = 2013 |eprint=1311.1104 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an even bigger structure twice as large as the former.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&amp;nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt; At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html "The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=0-691-05862-8 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===

The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm).

Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. 

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

==Mass of ordinary matter==
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes or 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="Paul Davies 2006 43"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM). However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.
===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds| url= https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=parallel+worlds&amp;sprefix=Parallel%2Cstripbooks%2C271| accessdate=1 July 2013 |date=2005|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3372-0|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; critical density, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Schutz|title=Gravity from the ground up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEZNXvYwyNwC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45506-0|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The current value for ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} (refer to previous section) and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which in reality make up about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward. Divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen atoms.

The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an "optical horizon" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

'''Orestes Pursued by the Furies''' is an event from Greek mythology that is a recurring theme in art depicting [[Orestes]].

==Background==
In the [[The Iliad|''Iliad'']], the king of Argos, [[Agamemnon]], sacrifices his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to the Gods to assure good sailing weather to Troy. 
[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Orestes Pursued by the Furies - 1921.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]
In  ''Agamemnon'', the first play of [[Aeschylus]]'s [[Oresteia]] trilogy, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], and her lover, Aegisthus as revenge for sacrificing Iphigenia. In ''The Libation Bearers'', the second play of the Orestia, Agamemnon's son Orestes returns home to take revenge on his mother for murdering his father. 

Orestes ultimately does murder his mother, and afterward is tormented by [[Erinyes|The Furies]], beings who personify the anger of the dead.

==In Art==
Orestes being tormented by the Furies has been depicted by a number of artists.

A '''parasitic plant''' is a [[plant]] that derives some or all of its nutritional requirement from another living plant. They make up about 1% of [[angiosperms]] and are in almost every [[biome]] in the world. All parasitic plants have modified roots, named haustoria (singular: [[haustorium]]), which penetrates the host plants, connecting them to the conductive system – either the [[xylem]], the [[phloem]], or both. This provides them with the ability to extract water and nutrients from the host. [[Parasite|Parasitic]] plants are classified depending on where the parasitic plant latches onto the host and the amount of nutrients it requires.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/lib/washington/reader.action?docID=593748 |author=Heide-Jørgensen, Henning S. |year=2008 |title=Parasitic flowering plants |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-9004167506}}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parasitic plants are able to locate their [[host (biology)|host]] plants by detecting [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] in the air or soil given off by host [[shoot]]s or [[root]]s, respectively. About 4,500 [[species]] of parasitic plant in approximately 20 families of [[flowering plant]]s are known.&lt;ref&gt;Nickrent, D. L. and Musselman, L. J. 2004. Introduction to Parasitic Flowering Plants. ''The Plant Health Instructor''. {{doi|10.1094/PHI-I-2004-0330-01}} [http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/pathogengroups/pages/parasiticplants.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;

== Classification ==
Parasitic plants are characterized as follows:&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;&lt;!--pages needed--&gt;

*1a. [[Obligate parasite]] – a parasite that cannot complete its life cycle without a host.
*1b. [[Facultative parasite]] – a parasite that can complete its life cycle independent of a host.
*2a. Stem parasite – a parasite that attaches to the host stem.
*2b. Root parasite – a parasite that attaches to the host root.
*3a. Hemiparasite – a plant parasitic under natural conditions, but [[photosynthetic]] to some degree. Hemiparasites may just obtain water and mineral nutrients from the host plant; many obtain at least part of their organic nutrients from the host as well.
*3b. Holoparasite - a parasitic plant that derives all of its fixed carbon from the host plant. Commonly lacking chlorophyll, holoparasites are often colors other than green.

[[File:Mistletoe, coming soon to a market near you - geograph.org.uk - 1585249.jpg|thumb|[[Mistletoe]], an obligate stem hemiparasite]]

For hemiparasites, one from each of the three sets of terms can be applied to the same species, e.g. 
*''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'' (Western Australian Christmas tree) is an obligate root hemiparasite.
*''[[Rhinanthus]]'' (e.g. [[Yellow rattle]]) is a facultative root hemiparasite.
*[[Mistletoe]] is an obligate stem hemiparasite.

Holoparasites are always obligate so only two terms are needed, e.g. 
*[[Cuscuta europaea|Dodder]] is a stem holoparasite.
*''[[Hydnora]]'' spp. are root holoparasites.

Plants usually considered holoparasites include [[Orobanche|broomrape]], [[Cuscuta|dodder]], ''[[Rafflesia]]'', and the [[Hydnoraceae]].  Plants usually considered hemiparasites include ''[[Castilleja]]'', [[mistletoe]], [[Western Australian Christmas tree]], and [[yellow rattle]].

==Evolution of parasitic behavior==
[[File:Striga root connections.jpg|thumb|''[[Striga]]'' witchweeds (white, centre, attached to roots of host) are economically important pests of the crop plants that they parasitise.]]

Parasitic behavior evolved in angiosperms roughly 12-13 times independently, a classic example of convergent evolution. Roughly 1% of all angiosperm species are parasitic, with a large degree of host dependence. The taxonomic family ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' (encompassing the genera ''Tryphysaria'', ''[[Striga]]'', and ''[[Orobanche]]'') is the only family that contains both holoparasitic and hemiparasitic species, making it a model group for studying the evolutionary rise of [[parasitism]]. The remaining groups contain only hemiparasites or holoparasites.&lt;ref name=Westwood&gt;Westwood, James H., John I. Yoder, Michael P. Timko and Claude W. Depamphilis. "The Evolution of Parasitism in Plants." ''Trends in Plant Science'' 15.4 (2010) 227-35. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary event which gave rise to parasitism in plants was the development of haustoria. The first, most ancestral, haustoria are thought to be similar to that of the facultative hemiparasites within ''Tryphysaria'', lateral haustoria develop along the surface of the roots in these species. Later evolution led to the development of terminal or primary haustoria at the tip of the juvenile [[radicle]], seen in obligate hemiparasitic species within ''[[Striga]]''. Lastly, obligate holoparasitic behavior originated with the loss of the photosynthetic process, seen in the genus ''[[Orobanche]]''.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt;

To maximize resources, many parasitic plants have evolved '''self-incompatibility''', to avoid parasitizing themselves. Others such as ''[[Triphysaria]]'' usually avoid parasitizing other members of their species, but some parasitic plants have no such limits.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt; The [[albino redwood]] is a mutant ''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'' that produces no chlorophyll; they live on sugars from neighbouring trees, usually the parent tree from which they have grown (via a somatic mutation).&lt;ref name = "Stienstra"&gt;{{cite news |last = Stienstra | first = T. | title = It's no snow job - handful of redwoods are rare albinos | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = 11 October 2007 |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/11/SPK4SI0PM.DTL |accessdate = December 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Krieger"&gt;{{cite web | last = Krieger | first = L.

==Seed germination==

Parasitic plants [[Germination|germinate]] in a variety of ways. These means can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. Most parasitic plants need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited due in part to the fact that most parasitic plants are not able to use [[autotrophic]] nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott, P. 2008. Physiology and behavior of plants: parasitic plants. John Wiley &amp; sons pp. 103–112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon&gt;Runyon, J. Tooker, J. Mescher, M. De Moraes, C.  2009.  Parasitic plants in agriculture: Chemical ecology of germination and host-plant location as targets for sustainable control: A review. Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 1. pp. 123-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Root parasitic plant seeds tend to use chemical cues for germination. In order for germination to occur, seeds need to be fairly close to their host plant.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt; For example, the seeds of witchweed (''[[Striga asiatica]]'') need to be within 3 to 4 millimeters (mm) of its host in order to pick up chemical signals in the soil to signal germination.  This range is important because ''Striga asiatica'' will only grow about 4&amp;nbsp;mm after germination.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;  Chemical compound cues sensed by parasitic plant seeds are from host plant root exudates that are leached in close proximity from the host’s [[root|root system]] into the surrounding soil.  These chemical cues are a variety of compounds that are unstable and rapidly degraded in soil and are present within a radius of a few meters of the plant exuding them. Parasitic plants germinate and follow a concentration gradient of these compounds in the soil toward the host plants if close enough. These compounds are called [[strigolactone]]s. Strigolactone stimulates [[Ethylene (plant hormone)|ethylene biosynthesis]] in seeds causing them to germinate.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;

There are a variety of chemical germination stimulants. [[Strigol]] was the first of the germination stimulants to be isolated.  It was isolated from a non-host cotton plant and has been found in true host plants such as corn and millets.   The stimulants are usually plant specific, examples of other germination stimulants include [[sorgolactone]] from sorghum, orobanchol and alectrol from red clover, and [[5-deoxystrigol]] from ''Lotus japonicas''. Strigolactones are apocarotenoids that are produced via the carotenoid pathway of plants. Strigolactones and mycorrhizal fungi have a relationship in which Strigolactone also cues the growth of mycorrhizal fungus.&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneeweiss, G. 2007.  Correlated evolution of life history and host range  in the  nonphotosynthetic parasitic flowering plants Orobanche and Phelipanche (Orobanchaceae). Journal Compilation. European  Society for Evolutionary Biology. 20 471-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stem parasitic plants, unlike most root parasites, germinate using the resources inside their endosperms and are able to survive for some time. For example, [[Cuscuta|the dodders (''Cuscuta'' spp.)]] drop their seeds to the ground; these may remain [[dormancy|dormant]] for up to five years before they find a host plant nearby. Using the resources in the seed [[endosperm]], dodder is able to germinate. Once germinated, the plant has 6 days to find and establish a connection with its host plant before its resources run out.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; Dodder seeds germinate above ground and then the plant sends out stems in search of its host plant reaching up to 6&amp;nbsp;cm before it dies. It is believed that the plant uses two methods of finding a host.  The stem detects its host plant's scent and orients itself in that direction. Scientists used volatiles from [[tomato]] plants ([[α-pinene]], [[β-myrcene]], and [[phellandrene|β-phellandrene]]) to test the reaction of C. ''pentagona'' and found that the stem orients itself in the direction of the odor.&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;  Some studies suggest that by using light reflecting from nearby plants dodders are able to select host with higher sugar because of the levels of [[chlorophyll]] in the leaves.&lt;ref name=Lesica&gt;Lesica, P. 2010. Dodder: Hardly Doddering. Kelseya Newsletter of Montana Native Plant Society. Vol 23. 2, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Once the dodder finds its host, it wraps itself around the host plants stem.  Using adventitious roots, the dodder taps into the host plant's stem with a [[haustorium]], an absorptive organ within the host plant [[vascular tissue]]. Dodder makes several of these connections with the host as it moves up the plant.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lesica/&gt;

=== Seed dispersal ===

There are several methods of seed dispersal, but all the strategies aim to put the seed in direct contact with, or within a critical distance of, the host.

# The [[Cuscuta|Cuscuta seedling]] can live for 3–7 weeks and extend out 35&amp;nbsp;cm in search of the host before it dies. This is because the Cuscuta seed is large and has stored nutrients to sustain its life. This is also useful for seeds that get digested by animals and excreted out.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;
# [[Mistletoe]] use a sticky seed for dispersal. The seed sticks to nearby animals and birds and then comes into direct contact with the host.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;
# [[Arceuthobium]] seeds have a similarly sticky seed as the mistletoe but they do not rely on animals and birds, they mainly disperse by fruit [[Explosion|explosiveness]]. Once the seed makes contact with the host rain water can help position the seed into a suitable position.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;
# Some seeds detect and respond to [[Chemical substance|chemical stimulations]] produced in the host’s roots and start to grow towards the host.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;

== Obstacles of attaching to a host ==
The parasitic plant has many obstacles to overcome in order to attach to the host. Distance from the host and stored nutrients are only some of the problems, the host's defenses are an obstacle to overcome itself. The first hurdle is penetrating the host, the host has systems to reinforce the cell wall by [[Cross-link|protein cross-linking]] so that it stops the parasitic progress at the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the host's roots. The second hurdle is the host's ability to [[Secretion|secrete]] germination inhibitors. This prevents [[germination]] of the parasitic seed. The third hurdle is the host's ability to create a [[Toxicity|toxic]] environment for where the parasitic plant attaches to. The host secretes [[phenols|phenolic]] compounds into the [[apoplast]] the creates a toxic environment for the parasitic plant eventually killing it. The fourth hurdle is the host's ability to ruin the [[tubercle]] using gums and gels or injecting toxins into the [[tubercle]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters, D. (2010). Plant Defense Warding off attack by pathogens, herbivores and parasitic plants. Hoboken: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host range==
Some parasitic plants are generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (''[[Cassytha]]'' spp., ''[[Cuscuta]]'' spp.) and red rattle (''[[Odontites vernus]]'') are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few or even just one species. Beech drops (''[[Epifagus virginiana]]'') is a root holoparasite only on American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''). ''[[Rafflesia]]'' is a holoparasite on the vine ''Tetrastigma''. Plants such as ''[[Pterospora]]'' become parasites of [[mycorrhizal]] fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of ''Tryphysaria'' experience reduced haustorium development in the presence of other ''Tryphysaria''. Although, the mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt;

==Aquatic parasitic plants==
Parasitism also evolved within aquatic species of plants and algae. Parasitic marine plants are described as [[benthos|benthic]], meaning that they are sedentary or attached to another structure. Plants and algae that grow on the host plant, using it as an attachment point are given the designation [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] ([[lithophyte|epilithic]] is the name given to plants/algae that use rocks or boulders for attachment), while not necessarily parasitic, some species occur in high correlation with a certain host species, suggesting that they rely on the host plant in some way or another. In contrast, [[endophyte|endophytic]] plants and algae grow inside their host plant, these have a wide range of host dependence from obligate holoparasites to facultative hemiparasites.&lt;ref name=Dring&gt;Dring, M. J. ''The Biology of Marine Plants''. London: E. Arnold, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine parasites occur as a higher proportion of marine flora in temperate rather than tropical waters. While no full explanation for this is available, many of the potential host plants such as [[kelp]] and other macroscopic [[brown algae]] are generally restricted to temperate areas. Roughly 75% of parasitic [[red algae]] infect hosts in the same taxonomic family as themselves, these are given the designation adelphoparasites. Other marine parasites, deemed endozoic, are parasites of marine invertebrates ([[mollusca|molluscs]], [[flatworm]]s, [[sponge]]s) and can be either holoparasitic or hemiparasitic, some retaining the ability to photosynthesize after infection.&lt;ref name=Dring/&gt;

==Importance==
Species within ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' are some of the most economically destructive species on Earth. Species of ''[[Striga]]'' alone are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. ''[[Striga]]'' can infest both grasses and grains, including [[Zea mays|corn]], [[Oryza sativa|rice]] and [[Sorghum]], undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. ''[[Orobanche]]'' also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, [[Cicer arietinum|chickpeas]], [[Solanum lycopersicum|tomatoes]], [[carrot]]s, and varieties of the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' (e.g. cabbage, lettuce, and broccoli). Yield loss from ''[[Orobanche]]'' can reach 100% and has caused farmers in some regions of the world to abandon certain staple crops and begin importing others as an alternative. Much research has been devoted to the control of ''Orobanche'' and ''Striga'' species, which are even more devastating in developing areas of the world, though no method has been found to be entirely successful.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt;

*Mistletoes cause economic damage to forest and ornamental trees.
*''[[Rafflesia arnoldii]]'' produces the world's largest flowers at about one meter in diameter. It is a tourist attraction in its native habitat.
*[[Sandalwood]] trees (''Santalum'' species) have many important cultural uses and their fragrant oils have high commercial value.
*Indian paintbrush (''[[Castilleja|Castilleja linariaefolia]]'') is the state flower of Wyoming.
*The Oak Mistletoe (''[[Phoradendron|Phoradendron serotinum]]'') is the floral emblem of Oklahoma.
*A few other parasitic plants are occasionally cultivated for their attractive flowers, such as ''Nutysia'' and broomrape.
*Parasitic plants are important in research, especially on the loss of photosynthesis during evolution.
*A few dozen parasitic plants have occasionally been used as food by people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/ParasiteFood.html Parasitic Angiosperms Used for Food?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Western Australian Christmas tree (''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'') sometimes damages underground cables. It mistakes the cables for host roots and tries to parasitize them using its sclerenchymatic guillotine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~b_morpho/nuytsia_backenzahn.html Sclerenchymatic guillotine in the haustorium of Nuytsia floribunda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060726050051/http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~b_morpho/nuytsia_backenzahn.html |date=2006-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some parasitic plants are destructive while some have positive influences in their [[Community|communities]]. Some parasitic plants damage [[invasive species]] more than [[native species]].

==Plants parasitic on fungi==
About 400 species of flowering plants, plus one [[gymnosperm]] (''[[Parasitaxus|Parasitaxus usta]]''), are parasitic on mycorrhizal fungi. This effectively gives these plants the ability to become associated with many of the other plants around them. They are termed [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophs]].  Some myco-heterotrophs are Indian pipe (''[[Monotropa uniflora]]''), snow plant (''[[Sarcodes|Sarcodes sanguinea]]''), underground orchid (''[[Rhizanthella gardneri]]''), bird's nest orchid (''[[Neottia nidus-avis]]''), and sugarstick (''[[Allotropa virgata]]''). Within the taxonomic family ''[[Ericaceae]]'', known for extensive mycorrhizal relationships, there are the Monotropoids. The Monotropoids include the genera ''[[Monotropa]]'', ''[[Monotropsis]]'', and ''[[Pterospora]]'' among others. Myco-heterotrophic behavior is commonly accompanied by the loss of chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Judd, Walter S., Christopher Campbell, and Elizabeth A. Kellogg.

'''Pitch correction''' is an electronic [[effects unit]] or [[digital audio editor|audio software]] that changes the [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] (highness or lowness in pitch) of an [[Audio signal processing|audio signal]] so that all pitches will be notes from the [[Equal temperament|equally tempered system]] (i.e., like the pitches on a [[piano]]). Pitch correction devices do this without affecting other aspects of its sound. Pitch correction first detects the pitch of an audio signal (using a live [[pitch detection algorithm]]), then calculates the desired change and modifies the audio signal accordingly. The widest use of pitch corrector devices is in Western [[popular music]] on [[Lead vocals|vocal lines]].

==History==
Prior to the invention of pitch correction, errors in vocal intonation in recordings could only be corrected by re-recording the entire song (in the early era of recording) or, after the development of [[multitrack recording]], by [[overdubbing]] the incorrect vocal pitches by re-recording those specific notes or sections. By the late 70s, engineers were fixing parts using the Eventide Harmonizer H49. Prior to the development of electronic pitch correction devices, there was no way to make "[[Real-time computing|real time]]" corrections to a live vocal performance in a concert (although [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] was used in some cases where a performer was not able to sing adequately in live performances).

Pitch correction was relatively uncommon before 1997, when Antares Audio Technology's [[Auto-Tune]] Pitch Correcting Plug-In was introduced.  This replaced slow studio techniques with a real-time process that could also be used in live performance.&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Craig. "In Search of the Perfect Pitch; The fix is in". EQ.  2006-07-01. Pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Auto-Tune is still widely used, as are other pitch-correction algorithms including [[Celemony#DNA Direct Note Access|Celemony's Direct Note Access]] which allows adjustment of individual notes in a polyphonic audio signal,&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.233. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Celemony's [[Melodyne]].  Pitch correction is now a common feature in digital audio editing software, having first appeared as a [[Pro Tools]] plugin and now being found in products such as [[Apple GarageBand]], [[Apple Logic Pro]], [[Adobe Audition]], [[FL Studio]], [[Digital Performer]], and [[Steinberg Cubase]]. MorphTune also provides this functionality. It is also available in the form of [[rackmount]] hardware, such as the [[TC-Helicon]] VoiceOne. There is also a large [[stompbox]] pedal that provides pitch correction in a small device that could be used at a show by plugging the vocal microphone into the pedal and then sending the signal to the [[PA system]]. A free [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] plugin known as GSnap can also be used to get the same effect. In the [[Linux]] [[FOSS]] community, Autotalent and Zita-AT1 offer this functionality.

==Uses==
===Pitch correction===
The most common use of pitch correctors is to fix wrong [[intonation (music)|intonation]] (tuning) of notes sung by vocalists in popular music sound recordings. The use of pitch correction speeds up the recording process, because singers do not need to keep singing a song or vocal line and re-recording it until the pitches are correct. The pitch correction software can correct any pitch errors in the singing without the need for [[overdubbing]] or re-recording.

While pitch correction is most associated with fixing vocal intonation errors, it can also be used to fix intonation in recorded instrumental parts such as violin, cello or trumpet.

===Vocal harmony and vibrato===
Pitch correctors are commonly used in music studios to add the sound of [[vocal harmony]] to certain sung words or phrases without re-recording those lines again at the necessary pitches or using [[backup vocals|backup singers]].  Depending on the model used, various vocal effects can be added and the better quality devices can be adjusted to allow expression to remain in the music. Some pitch correctors can add [[vibrato]].

===Extreme effects===
While pitch correction devices were initially designed to produce natural-sounding effects, producers discovered that by setting extreme parameter values, unusual effects could be obtained. Pitch correction devices became popular in the late 1990s as a distinctively electronic, [[vocoder]]-like voice effect. A notable example of [[Auto-Tune]]-based pitch correction is the [[Cher effect]], so named because producer [[Mark Taylor (producer)|Mark Taylor]] originated the effect in her 1998 hit song "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sillitoe, Sue &amp; Bell, Matt (1999-02). "[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/tracks661.htm Recording Cher's Believe]". ''[[Sound on Sound]]''. Retrieved on 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been used by composer John Boswell for his [[Symphony of Science]] and Symphony of [[Bang Goes the Theory#Symphony of Bang Goes The Theory|Bang Goes The Theory]] (a BBC science show) mash-ups. American Rapper [[T-Pain]] is known for his skillful use of this effect.

==Criticism==
One criticism of pitch correction is that it allows recording engineers to create a perfectly in-tune performance from a vocalist who is otherwise not skilled enough to give one, adding a degree of dishonesty to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/vocalfixes.htm |title=Vocal Fixes: Modern Vocal Processing In Practice |author=Daley, Dan |accessdate=2009-02-12 |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was featured in a 2001 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', entitled "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]". In the episode, a cartoon representation of a pitch corrector (labeled "Studio Magic") was used to make up for the total lack of singing talent in a manufactured [[boy band]], of which [[Bart Simpson]] was a member.

In 2003, [[Allison Moorer]] began attaching stickers to her 2002 album ''[[Miss Fortune (album)|Miss Fortune]]'' reading "Absolutely no vocal tuning or pitch-correction was used in the making of this record." &lt;ref&gt;Everett-Green, Robert. (2006-10-14). "Ruled By Frankenmusic; The computer program that cleans up singers' pitch is reshaping the character of pop". The Globe and Mail (Canada). Pg. R1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' report from 2003 stated that "many successful mainstream artists in most genres of music—perhaps a majority of artists—are using pitch correction".&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{Cite news | title=What, no pitch correction? | url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/2003-04-28_chitrib_pitch_correction.pdf | last=Ryan | first=Maureen |date=27 April 2003| newspaper=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=2010-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Powell, a producer/engineer, stated in 2003 that he is "even starting to see vocal tuning devices show up in concert settings"; he states that "That's more of an ethical dilemma—people pay a premium dollar to see artists and artists want people to see them at their best."&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt;

In 2010, producer [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] claimed that the processing of [[Michael Jackson]]'s voice with [[Melodyne]] caused fans to question the [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] of the voice on the posthumous album ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.&lt;ref name="riley reuters"&gt;{{cite web |title=Voice on Jackson album far from finished article |author=Collett-White, Mike |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6BC1I020101213 |work=Reuters (UK Edition) |publisher=Thomson Reuters|date=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riley claimed that because he did not have a "final vocal" from Jackson, Melodyne had to be used "to make his voice work with the actual music," "to get him in key" and this resulted in the vibrato sounding "a little off" or "over-processed."&lt;ref name="riley reuters" /&gt;

'''Plant nutrition''' is the study of the [[chemical element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compounds]] necessary for plant growth, plant metabolism and their external supply. In 1972, [[Emanuel Epstein]] defined two criteria for an element to be essential for plant growth:

# in its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle.
# or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite.

This is in accordance with Justus von [[Liebig's law of the minimum]].&lt;ref name="Epstein1972" /&gt; The essential plant nutrients include [[carbon]], [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] which are absorbed from the air, whereas other nutrients including nitrogen are typically obtained from the  soil (exceptions include some [[parasitic plant|parasitic]] or [[carnivorous plant|carnivorous]] plants).

There are seventeen most important nutrients for plants. Plants must obtain the following mineral nutrients from their growing medium:-&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007" /&gt;
* the macronutrients: [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[potassium]] (K), [[calcium]] (Ca), [[sulfur]] (S), [[magnesium]] (Mg), [[carbon]] (C), [[oxygen]](O), [[hydrogen]] (H)
* the micronutrients (or trace minerals): [[iron]] (Fe), [[boron]] (B), [[chlorine]] (Cl), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[zinc]] (Zn), [[copper]] (Cu), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[nickel]] (Ni)

These elements stay beneath soil as [[salts]], so plants consume these elements as [[ions]]. The macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities; hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon contribute to over 95% of a plants' entire biomass on a dry matter weight basis. Micronutrients are present in plant tissue in quantities measured in parts per million, ranging from 0.1&lt;ref name="Marschner2012" /&gt; to 200&amp;nbsp;ppm, or less than 0.02% dry weight.&lt;ref name=aesl /&gt;

Most [[soil]] conditions across the world can provide plants adapted to that climate and soil with sufficient nutrition for a complete life cycle, without the addition of nutrients as [[fertilizer]]. However, if the soil is cropped it is necessary to artificially modify [[soil fertility]] through the addition of [[fertilizer]] to promote vigorous growth and increase or sustain yield. This is done because, even with adequate water and light, [[Physiological plant disorders#Nutrient deficiencies|nutrient deficiency]] can limit growth and crop yield.

==Processes==
Plants take up [[essential element]]s from the soil through their roots and from the air (mainly consisting of nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in [[photosynthesis]].

The [[root]], especially the root hair, is the essential organ for the uptake of nutrients. The structure and architecture of the root can alter the rate of nutrient uptake. Nutrient ions are transported to the center of the root, the [[stele (biology)|stele]], in order for the nutrients to reach the conducting tissues, xylem and phloem.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; The [[Casparian strip]], a cell wall outside the stele but within the root, prevents passive flow of water and nutrients, helping to regulate the uptake of nutrients and water.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; [[Xylem]] moves water and mineral ions within the plant and [[phloem]] accounts for organic molecule transportation. [[Water potential]] plays a key role in a plant's nutrient uptake. If the water potential is more negative within the plant than the surrounding soils, the nutrients will move from the region of higher solute concentration—in the soil—to the area of lower solute concentration - in the plant.

There are three fundamental ways plants uptake nutrients through the root: 
# [[Simple diffusion]] occurs when a nonpolar molecule, such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; follows a concentration gradient, moving passively through the cell lipid bilayer membrane without the use of transport proteins. 
# [[Facilitated diffusion]] is the rapid movement of solutes or ions following a concentration gradient, facilitated by transport proteins. 
# [[Active transport]] is the uptake by cells of ions or molecules against a concentration gradient; this requires an energy source, usually ATP, to power molecular pumps that move the ions or molecules through the membrane.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

Nutrients can be moved within plants to where they are most needed. For example, a plant will try to supply more nutrients to its younger leaves than to its older ones. When nutrients are mobile within the plant, symptoms of any deficiency become apparent first on the older leaves. However, not all nutrients are equally mobile. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are mobile nutrients while the others have varying degrees of mobility. When a less-mobile nutrient is deficient, the younger leaves suffer because the nutrient does not move up to them but stays in the older leaves.  This phenomenon is helpful in determining which nutrients a plant may be lacking.

Many plants engage in [[symbiosis]] with microorganisms.  Two important types of these relationship are 
# with bacteria such as [[rhizobia]], that carry out [[biological nitrogen fixation]], in which atmospheric [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted into [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}); and 
# with [[mycorrhizal fungi]], which through their association with the plant roots help to create a larger effective root surface area. Both of these mutualistic relationships enhance nutrient uptake.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; 
 
Though nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, relatively few plants harbour nitrogen-fixing bacteria, so most plants rely on nitrogen compounds present in the soil to support their growth. These can be supplied by [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralization]] of [[soil organic matter]] or added plant residues, nitrogen fixing bacteria, animal waste, through the breaking of triple bonded N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules by lightning strikes or through the application of [[fertilizer]]s.

==Functions of nutrients==
{{Further information|Soil#Nutrients}}

At least 17 elements are known to be essential nutrients for plants. In relatively large amounts, the soil supplies nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur; these are often called the [[Nutrient|macronutrients]]. In relatively small amounts, the [[soil]] supplies iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, and cobalt, the so-called [[Nutrient|micronutrients]]. Nutrients must be available not only in sufficient amounts but also in appropriate ratios.

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa. An abundance of one nutrient may cause a deficiency of another nutrient. For example, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake can be influenced by the amount of NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} available.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, relatively few plants engage in [[nitrogen fixation]] (conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to a biologically useful form). Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow.

Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. [[Plant|Green plants]] obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Each of these nutrients is used in a different place for a different essential function.&lt;ref name=Taiz2002 /&gt;

=== Macronutrients (derived from air and water) ===

====Carbon====

[[Carbon]] forms the backbone of most plant [[biomolecule]]s, including proteins, [[starch]]es and [[cellulose]]. [[Carbon fixation|Carbon is fixed]] through [[photosynthesis]]; this converts [[carbon dioxide]] from the air into [[carbohydrate]]s which are used to store and transport energy within the plant.

====Hydrogen====

[[Hydrogen]] also is necessary for building sugars and building the plant. It is obtained almost entirely from water. Hydrogen ions are imperative for a proton gradient to help drive the electron transport chain in photosynthesis and for respiration.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

====Oxygen====

[[Oxygen]] is a component of many organic and inorganic molecules within the plant, and is acquired in many forms. These include: [[Dioxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (mainly from the air via leaves) and [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], [[Nitrate|NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}]], [[Dihydrogen phosphate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO{{su|b=4|p=−}}]] and [[Sulfate|SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] (mainly from the soil water via roots). Plants produce oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) along with [[glucose]] during [[photosynthesis]] but then require O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to undergo aerobic [[cellular respiration]] and break down this glucose to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

===Macronutrients (primary)===

====Nitrogen====
{{Further information|Nitrogen cycle}}

[[Nitrogen]] is a major constituent of several of the most important plant substances. For example, nitrogen compounds comprise 40% to 50% of the dry matter of [[protoplasm]], and it is a constituent of [[amino acid]]s, the building blocks of [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="swan2"/&gt; It is also an essential constituent of [[chlorophyll]].&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter3" /&gt; [[Nitrogen deficiency]] most often results in stunted growth, slow growth, and chlorosis. Nitrogen deficient plants will also exhibit a purple appearance on the stems, petioles and underside of leaves from an accumulation of anthocyanin pigments.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; Most of the nitrogen taken up by plants is from the soil in the forms of NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}, although in acid environments such as boreal forests where nitrification is less likely to occur, ammonium NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} is more likely to be the dominating source of nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Lowenfels2011 /&gt; Amino acids and proteins can only be built from NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}, so NO{{su|b=3|p=−}} must be reduced. In many agricultural settings, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for rapid growth. Nitrogen is transported via the xylem from the roots to the leaf canopy as nitrate ions, or in an organic form, such as amino acids or amides. Nitrogen can also be transported in the phloem sap as amides, amino acids and ureides; it is therefore mobile within the plant, and the older leaves exhibit chlorosis and necrosis earlier than the younger leaves.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter3" /&gt;

There is an abundant supply of nitrogen in the earth’s atmosphere — N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas comprises nearly 79% of air. However, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unavailable for use by most organisms because there is a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms in the molecule,  making it almost inert. In order for nitrogen to be used for growth it must be [[Nitrogen fixation|“fixed”]] (combined) in the form of [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}) or nitrate (NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}) ions. The weathering of rocks releases these ions so slowly that it has a negligible effect on the availability of fixed nitrogen. Therefore, nitrogen is often the limiting factor for growth and [[biomass]] production in all environments where there is a suitable climate and availability of water to support life.

Nitrogen enters the plant largely through the [[root]]s. A “pool” of soluble nitrogen accumulates. Its composition within a species varies widely depending on several factors, including day length, time of day, night temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and nutrient imbalance. Short day length promotes [[asparagine]] formation, whereas glutamine is produced under long day regimes. Darkness favors protein breakdown accompanied by high asparagine accumulation. Night temperature modifies the effects due to night length, and soluble nitrogen tends to accumulate owing to retarded synthesis and breakdown of proteins. Low night temperature conserves [[glutamine]]; high night temperature increases accumulation of asparagine because of breakdown. Deficiency of K accentuates differences between long- and short-day plants. The pool of soluble nitrogen is much smaller than in well-nourished plants when N and P are deficient since uptake of nitrate and further reduction and conversion of N to organic forms is restricted more than is protein synthesis. Deficiencies of Ca, K, and S affect the conversion of organic N to protein more than uptake and reduction. The size of the pool of soluble N is no guide ''per se'' to growth rate, but the size of the pool in relation to total N might be a useful ratio in this regard. Nitrogen availability in the rooting medium also affects the size and structure of tracheids formed in the long lateral roots of white spruce (Krasowski and Owens 1999).&lt;ref name="kras"/&gt;

[[Microorganism]]s have a central role in almost all aspects of nitrogen availability, and therefore for life support on earth. Some bacteria can convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ammonia by the process termed ''[[nitrogen fixation]]''; these bacteria are either free-living or form [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations with plants or other organisms (e.g., termites, protozoa), while other bacteria bring about transformations of [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]], and of nitrate to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or other nitrogen gases. Many [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] degrade organic matter, releasing fixed nitrogen for reuse by other organisms. All these processes contribute to the [[nitrogen cycle]].

====Phosphorus====
{{Further information|Phosphorus cycle}}

Like nitrogen, [[phosphorus]] is involved with many vital plant processes. Within a plant, it is present mainly as a structural component of the [[nucleic acid]]s: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA), as well as a constituent of fatty [[phospholipid]]s, that are important in membrane development and function. It is present in both organic and inorganic forms, both of which are readily translocated within the plant. All energy transfers in the cell are critically dependent on phosphorus.  As with all living things, phosphorus is part of the [[Adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which is of immediate use in all processes that require energy with the cells. Phosphorus can also be used to modify the activity of various enzymes by [[phosphorylation]], and is used for [[cell signaling]]. Phosphorus is concentrated at the most actively growing points of a plant and stored within seeds in anticipation of their germination. Phosphorus is most commonly found in the soil in the form of polyprotic phosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), but is taken up most readily in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO{{su|b=4|p=−}}. Phosphorus is available to plants in limited quantities in most soils because it is released very slowly from insoluble phosphates and is rapidly fixed once again. Under most environmental conditions it is the element that limits growth because of this constriction and due to its high demand by plants and microorganisms. Plants can increase phosphorus uptake by a mutualism with mycorrhiza.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;
A [[Phosphorus deficiency]] in plants is characterized by an intense green coloration or reddening in leaves due to lack of chlorophyll. If the plant is experiencing high phosphorus deficiencies the leaves may become denatured and show signs of death. Occasionally the leaves may appear purple from an accumulation of [[anthocyanin]]. Because phosphorus is a mobile nutrient, older leaves will show the first signs of deficiency.

On some [[soil]]s, the phosphorus nutrition of some [[Pinophyta|conifers]], including the spruces, depends on the ability of [[mycorrhiza]]e to take up, and make soil phosphorus available to the tree, hitherto unobtainable to the non-mycorrhizal root. Seedling white spruce, greenhouse-grown in sand testing negative for phosphorus, were very small and purple for many months until spontaneous mycorrhizal inoculation, the effect of which was manifested by a greening of foliage and the development of vigorous shoot growth.

[[Phosphorus deficiency]] can produce symptoms similar to those of nitrogen deficiency,&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; but as noted by Russel:&lt;ref name="russ" /&gt; “Phosphate deficiency differs from nitrogen deficiency in being extremely difficult to diagnose, and crops can be suffering from extreme starvation without there being any obvious signs that lack of phosphate is the cause”. Russell’s observation applies to at least some [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] seedlings, but Benzian&lt;ref name="benz1965"/&gt; found that although response to phosphorus in very acid forest tree nurseries in England was consistently high, no species (including Sitka spruce) showed any visible symptom of deficiency other than a slight lack of lustre. Phosphorus levels have to be exceedingly low before visible symptoms appear in such seedlings. In sand culture at 0 ppm phosphorus, white spruce seedlings were very small and tinted deep purple; at 0.62 ppm, only the smallest seedlings were deep purple; at 6.2 ppm, the seedlings were of good size and color.&lt;ref name="swan4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swan5"&gt;Swan, H.S.D. 1962. The scientific use of fertilizers in forestry. p. 13-24 ''in'' La Fertilisation Forestière au Canada. Fonds de Recherches Forestières, Laval Univ., Quebec QC, Bull. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful to apply a high phosphorus content fertilizer, such as bone meal, to perennials to help with successful root formation.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

====Potassium====

Unlike other major elements, [[potassium]] does not enter into the composition of any of the important plant constituents involved in metabolism,&lt;ref name="swan2" /&gt; but it does occur in all parts of plants in substantial amounts. It seems to be of particular importance in leaves and at growing points. Potassium is outstanding among the nutrient elements for its mobility and solubility within plant tissues. Processes involving potassium include the formation of [[carbohydrate]]s and [[protein]]s, the regulation of internal plant moisture, as a catalyst and condensing agent of complex substances, as an accelerator of enzyme action, and as contributor to [[photosynthesis]], especially under low light intensity.

[[Potassium]] regulates the opening and closing of the [[stomata]] by a potassium ion pump. Since stomata are important in water regulation, potassium regulates water loss from the leaves and increases [[drought]] tolerance. [[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] may cause necrosis or interveinal chlorosis. The potassium ion (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is highly mobile and can aid in balancing the anion (negative) charges within the plant. Potassium helps in fruit coloration, shape and also increases its [[brix]]. Hence, quality fruits are produced in potassium-rich soils. Potassium serves as an activator of enzymes used in photosynthesis and respiration.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; Potassium is used to build cellulose and aids in photosynthesis by the formation of a chlorophyll precursor. [[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] may result in higher risk of pathogens, wilting, chlorosis, brown spotting, and higher chances of damage from frost and heat.

When [[soil]]-potassium levels are high, plants take up more potassium than needed for healthy growth. The term ''luxury consumption'' has been applied to this. When potassium is moderately deficient, the effects first appear in the older tissues, and from there progress towards the growing points. Acute deficiency severely affects growing points, and die-back commonly occurs. Symptoms of potassium deficiency in white spruce include: browning and death of needles ([[chlorosis]]); reduced growth in height and diameter; impaired retention of needles; and reduced needle length.&lt;ref name="heib"/&gt; A relationship between potassium nutrition and cold resistance has been found in several tree species, including two species of spruce.&lt;ref name="sato"/&gt;

===Macronutrients (secondary and tertiary)===

====Sulfur====
[[Sulfur]] is a structural component of some amino acids (including [[cystein]] and [[methionine]]) and vitamins, and is essential for [[chloroplast]] growth and function; it is found in the iron-sulfur complexes of the electron transport chains in photosynthesis. It is needed for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation by legumes, and the conversion of nitrate into amino acids and then into protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haneklaus|first1=Silvia|last2=Bloem|first2=Elke|last3=Schnug|first3=Ewald|last4=de Kok|first4=Luit J.|last5=Stulen|first5=Ineke|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Allen V.|editor2-last=Pilbeam|editor2-first=David J.|title=Handbook of plant nutrition|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5904-9|pages=183-238|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ZWjLBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=sulfur#v=snippet&amp;q=sulfur&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 June 2017|chapter=Sulfur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, sulfur cannot be mobilized from older leaves for new growth, so deficiency symptoms are seen in the youngest tissues first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Nutrition|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/publicat/faobul4/faobul4/b402.htm|website=www.fao.org|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of deficiency include yellowing of leaves and stunted growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diagnosing sulphur deficiency in cereals|url=https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/mycrop/diagnosing-sulphur-deficiency-cereals|website=www.agric.wa.gov.au|accessdate=12 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calcium====
[[Calcium]] regulates transport of other nutrients into the plant and is also involved in the activation of certain plant enzymes. [[Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)|Calcium deficiency]] results in stunting. This nutrient is involved in photosynthesis and plant structure.&lt;ref name="transport protein identified" /&gt;&lt;ref name=new-light /&gt; [[Calcium deficiency (plant disorder)|Blossom end rot]] is also a result of inadequate calcium.&lt;ref name="transport protein identified"/&gt;

Another common symptom of calcium deficiency in leaves is the curling of the leaf towards the veins or center of the leaf. Many times this can also have a blackened appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=E. W.|date=1978-01-01|title=The Symptoms of Calcium Deficiency in Plants|jstor=2431629|journal=The New Phytologist|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb02259.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calcium has been found to have a positive effect in combating salinity in soils. It has been shown to ameliorate the negative effects that salinity has such as reduced water usage of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaya|first=C|last2=Kirnak|first2=H|last3=Higgs|first3=D|last4=Saltali|first4=K|date=2002-02-28|title=Supplementary calcium enhances plant growth and fruit yield in strawberry cultivars grown at high (NaCl) salinity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423801003132|journal=Scientia Horticulturae|volume=93|issue=1|pages=65–74|doi=10.1016/S0304-4238(01)00313-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium in plants occurs chiefly in the [[Leaf|leaves]], with lower concentrations in seeds, fruits, and roots. A major function is as a constituent of cell walls. When coupled with certain acidic compounds of the jelly-like pectins of the middle lamella, calcium forms an insoluble salt. It is also intimately involved in [[meristem]]s, and is particularly important in root development, with roles in cell division, cell elongation, and the detoxification of hydrogen ions. Other functions attributed to calcium are; the neutralization of organic acids; inhibition of some potassium-activated ions; and a role in nitrogen absorption. A notable feature of calcium-deficient plants is a defective root system.&lt;ref name="russ"/&gt; Roots are usually affected before above-ground parts.&lt;ref name="chap"/&gt;

====Magnesium====
{{Main article|Magnesium in biological systems}}

The outstanding role of [[magnesium]] in plant nutrition is as a constituent of the [[chlorophyll]] molecule. As a carrier, it is also involved in numerous enzyme reactions as an effective activator, in which it is closely associated with energy-supplying [[phosphorus]] compounds. Magnesium is very mobile in plants, and, like potassium, when [[Magnesium deficiency (plants)|deficient]] is translocated from older to younger tissues, so that signs of deficiency appear first on the oldest tissues and then spread progressively to younger tissues.

=== Micro-nutrients ===

Plants are able sufficiently to accumulate most trace elements. Some plants are sensitive indicators of the chemical environment in which they grow (Dunn 1991),&lt;ref name="dunn" /&gt; and some plants have barrier mechanisms that exclude or limit the uptake of a particular element or ion species, e.g., alder twigs commonly accumulate molybdenum but not arsenic, whereas the reverse is true of spruce bark (Dunn 1991).&lt;ref name="dunn" /&gt; Otherwise, a plant can integrate the geochemical signature of the soil mass permeated by its root system together with the contained groundwaters. Sampling is facilitated by the tendency of many elements to accumulate in tissues at the plant’s extremities.

====Iron====
[[Iron]] is necessary for photosynthesis and is present as an enzyme cofactor in plants. [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|Iron deficiency]] can result in interveinal [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]].
Iron is not a structural part of chlorophyll but very much essential for its synthesis. Copper deficiency can be responsible for promoting an iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=Ruhr2012 /&gt;
It helps in the electron transport of plant.

====Molybdenum====
[[Molybdenum]] is a cofactor to enzymes important in building amino acids and is involved in nitrogen metabolism. Molybdenum is part of the [[nitrate reductase]] enzyme (needed for the reduction of nitrate) and the [[nitrogenase]] enzyme (required for [[biological nitrogen fixation]]).&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|isbn=92-5-105490-8|pages=25–42|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/agll/docs/fpnb16.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2016|chapter=Chapter 3: Plant nutrients and basics of plant nutrition}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced productivity as a result of [[Molybdenum deficiency (plant disorder)|molybdenum deficiency]] is usually associated with the reduced activity of one or more of these enzymes.

====Boron====
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Overly detailed|section=yes|date=July 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{original research section|date=July 2016}}
}}
[[Boron]] is absorbed by plants in the form of the anion BO{{su|b=3|p=3−}}. It is available to plants in moderately soluble mineral forms of Ca, Mg and Na borates and the highly soluble form of organic compounds. It is available to plants over a range of pH, from 5.0 to 7.5. It is mobile in the soil, hence, it is prone to leaching. Leaching removes substantial amounts of boron in sandy soil, but little in fine silt or clay soil. Boron's fixation to those minerals at high pH can render boron unavailable, while low pH frees the fixed boron, leaving it prone to leaching in wet climates. It precipitates with other minerals in the form of borax in which form it was first used over 400 years ago as a soil supplement. Decomposition of organic material causes boron to be deposited in the topmost soil layer. When soil dries it can cause a precipitous drop in the availability of boron to plants as the plants cannot draw nutrients from that desiccated layer. Hence, boron deficiency diseases appear in dry weather.

Boron has many functions within a plant: it affects flowering and fruiting, pollen germination, cell division, and active salt absorption. The metabolism of amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, and water are strongly affected by boron. Many of those listed functions may be embodied by its function in moving the highly polar sugars through cell membranes by reducing their polarity and hence the energy needed to pass the sugar. If sugar cannot pass to the fastest growing parts rapidly enough, those parts die.

Boron is not relocatable in the plant via the [[phloem]]. It must be supplied to the growing parts via the [[xylem]]. Foliar sprays affect only those parts sprayed, which may be insufficient for the fastest growing parts, and is very temporary.

Boron is essential for the proper forming and strengthening of cell walls. Lack of boron results in short thick cells producing stunted fruiting bodies and roots. Calcium to boron ratio must be maintained in a narrow range for normal plant growth.  For alfalfa, that calcium to boron ratio must be from 80:1 to 600:1. Boron deficiency appears at 800:1 and higher. Boron levels within plants differ with plant species and range from 2.3 mg/kg for barley to 94.7 mg/kg for poppy. Lack of boron causes failure of calcium metabolism which produces hollow heart in beets and peanuts.

Inadequate amounts of boron affect many agricultural crops, legume forage crops most strongly.  Of the micronutrients, boron deficiencies are second most common after zinc. Deficiency results in the death of the terminal growing points and stunted growth.

Boron supplements derive from dry lake bed deposits such as those in Death Valley, USA, in the form of [[sodium tetraborate]] (borax), from which less soluble calcium borate is made. Foliar sprays are used on fruit crop trees in soils of high alkalinity. Boron is often applied to fields as a contaminant in other soil amendments but is not generally adequate to make up the rate of loss by cropping. The rates of application of borate to produce an adequate alfalfa crop range from 15 pounds per acre for a sandy-silt, acidic soil of low organic matter, to 60 pounds per acre for a soil with high organic matter, high cation exchange capacity and high pH.

Boron concentration in soil water solution higher than one ppm is toxic to most plants. Toxic concentrations within plants are 10 to 50 ppm for small grains and 200 ppm in boron-tolerant crops such as sugar beets, rutabaga, cucumbers, and conifers.  Toxic soil conditions are generally limited to arid regions or can be caused by underground borax deposits in contact with water or volcanic gases dissolved in percolating water. Application rates should be limited to a few pounds per acre in a test plot to determine if boron is needed generally. Otherwise, testing for boron levels in plant material is required to determine remedies. Excess boron can be removed by irrigation and assisted by application of elemental sulfur to lower the pH and increase boron solubility.

Boron deficiencies can be detected by analysis of plant material to apply a correction before the obvious symptoms appear, after which it is too late to prevent crop loss. Strawberries deficient in boron will produce lumpy fruit; apricots will not blossom or, if they do, will not fruit or will drop their fruit depending on the level of boron deficit. Broadcast of boron supplements is effective and long term; a foliar spray is immediate but must be repeated.

====Copper====
[[Copper]] is important for photosynthesis. Symptoms for copper deficiency include chlorosis.It is involved in many enzyme processes; necessary for proper photosynthesis; involved in the manufacture of lignin (cell walls) and involved in grain production. It is also hard to find in some soil conditions.

====Manganese====
[[Manganese]] is necessary for photosynthesis,&lt;ref name=new-light /&gt; including the building of [[chloroplast]]s. [[Manganese deficiency (plant)|Manganese deficiency]] may result in coloration abnormalities, such as discolored spots on the [[foliage]].

====Sodium====
[[Sodium]] is involved in the regeneration of [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] in [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] plants. Sodium can potentially replace potassium's regulation of stomatal opening and closing.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt;

Essentiality of sodium:
* Essential for C4 plants rather C3
* Substitution of K by Na: Plants can be classified into four groups:
# Group A—a high proportion of K can be replaced by Na and stimulate the growth, which cannot be achieved by the application of K
# Group B—specific growth responses to Na are observed but they are much less distinct
# Group C—Only minor substitution is possible and Na has no effect
# Group D—No substitution occurs
* Stimulate the growth—increase leaf area and stomata. Improves the water balance
* Na functions in metabolism
# C4 metabolism
# Impair the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenol-pyruvate
# Reduce the photosystem II activity and ultrastructural changes in mesophyll chloroplast
* Replacing K functions
# Internal osmoticum
# Stomatal function
# Photosynthesis
# Counteraction in long distance transport
# Enzyme activation
* Improves the crop quality e.g. improves the taste of carrots by increasing sucrose

====Zinc====
[[Zinc]] is required in a large number of enzymes and plays an essential role in [[Transcription_(biology)|DNA transcription]]. A typical symptom of [[Zinc deficiency (plant disorder)|zinc deficiency]] is the stunted growth of leaves, commonly known as "little leaf" and is caused by the oxidative degradation of the growth hormone [[auxin]].

====Nickel====
In [[vascular plant|higher plants]], [[nickel]] is absorbed by plants in the form of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Nickel is essential for activation of [[urease]], an enzyme involved with [[nitrogen metabolism]] that is required to process urea. Without nickel, toxic levels of urea accumulate, leading to the formation of necrotic lesions. In [[lower plants]], nickel activates several enzymes involved in a variety of processes, and can substitute for zinc and iron as a cofactor in some enzymes.&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007" /&gt;

====Chlorine====
[[Chlorine]], as compounded chloride, is necessary for [[osmosis]] and [[ionic balance]]; it also plays a role in [[photosynthesis]].

====Cobalt====
[[Cobalt]] has proven to be beneficial to at least some plants although it does not appear to be essential for most species.&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2015" /&gt; It has, however, been shown to be essential for [[nitrogen fixation]] by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with [[legumes]] and other plants.&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2015" /&gt;

====Aluminium====
Aluminum is one of the few elements capable of making soil more acidic. This is achieved by aluminum taking hydroxide ions out of water, leaving hydrogen ions behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossor-Pietraszewska|first=Teresa|year=2001|title=Effect of aluminium on plant growth and metabolism|url=http://www.actabp.pl/pdf/3_2001/673-686s.pdf|journal=Acta Biochimica Polonica|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the soil is more acidic, which makes it unlivable for many plants. Another consequence of aluminum in soils is aluminum toxicity, which inhibits root growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delhaize|first=Emmanuel|year=1995|title=Aluminum Toxicity and Tolerance in Plants|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC157131/pdf/1070315.pdf|journal=Update on Environmental Stress|volume=107|pages=315–321|via=|pmc=157131|pmid=12228360|doi=10.1104/pp.107.2.315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tea has a high tolerance for [[aluminum]] (Al) toxicity and the growth is stimulated by Al application. The possible reason is the prevention of Cu, Mn or P toxicity effects.
* There have been reports that Al may serve as a fungicide against certain types of [[root rot]].

====Silicon====
[[Silicon]] is not considered an essential element for plant growth and development. It is always found in abundance in the environment and hence if needed it is available. It is found in the structures of plants and improves the health of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadianwollastonite.com/soil-amendments/silicon-plant-health/|title=Wollastonite as a soil ammendment|website=canadianwollastonite.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421092532/http://canadianwollastonite.com/soil-amendments/silicon-plant-health/|archive-date=2017-04-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, [[silicon]] has been shown in experiments to strengthen [[cell wall]]s, improve plant strength, health, and productivity.&lt;ref name=PHC /&gt; There have been studies showing evidence of silicon improving [[drought]] and [[frost]] resistance, decreasing [[lodging]] potential and boosting the plant's natural pest and disease fighting systems.&lt;ref name=Bangalore /&gt; Silicon has also been shown to improve plant vigor and physiology by improving root mass and density, and increasing above ground plant [[biomass]] and [[crop yield]]s.&lt;ref name=PHC /&gt;  Silicon is currently under consideration by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO) for elevation to the status of a "plant beneficial substance".&lt;ref name=AAPFCO2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=presentation /&gt;

====Vanadium====
[[Vanadium]] may be required by some plants, but at very low concentrations. It may also be substituting for [[molybdenum]].

====Selenium====
[[Selenium]] is probably not essential for flowering plants, but it can be beneficial; it can stimulate plant growth, improve tolerance of oxidative stress, and increase resistance to pathogens and herbivory.&lt;ref name="White2016" /&gt;

Selenium is, however, an essential mineral element for animal (including human) nutrition and [[Selenium deficiency|selenium deficiencies]] are known to occur when food or animal feed is grown on selenium-deficient soils. The use of inorganic selenium fertilizers can increase selenium concentrations in edible crops and animal diets thereby improving animal health.&lt;ref name="White2016" /&gt;

==Nutrient deficiency==

The effect of a nutrient deficiency can vary from a subtle depression of growth rate to obvious stunting, deformity, discoloration, distress, and even death. Visual symptoms distinctive enough to be useful in identifying a deficiency are rare. Most deficiencies are multiple and moderate. However, while a deficiency is seldom that of a single nutrient, nitrogen is commonly the nutrient in shortest supply.

[[Chlorosis]] of foliage is not always due to mineral nutrient deficiency. Solarization can produce superficially similar effects, though mineral deficiency tends to cause premature defoliation, whereas solarization does not, nor does solarization depress nitrogen concentration.&lt;ref name="ronco" /&gt;

==Nutrient status of plants==

Nutrient status (mineral nutrient and trace element composition, also called ionome and nutrient profile) of plants are commonly portrayed by tissue elementary analysis. Interpretation of the results of such studies, however, has been controversial.&lt;ref name="parent" /&gt; During the last decades the nearly two-century-old “law of minimum” or “Liebig's law” (that states that plant growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource) has been replaced by several mathematical approaches that use different models in order to take the interactions between the individual nutrients into account. The latest developments in this field are based on the fact that the nutrient elements (and compounds) do not act independently from each other;&lt;ref name="parent" /&gt; Baxter, 2015,&lt;ref name="baxter"&gt;Baxter, I. 2015. Should we treat the ionome as a combination of individual elements, or should we be deriving novel combined traits? J. Exp. Bot. 66, 2127–2131. doi:10.1093/jxb/erv040&lt;/ref&gt; because there may be direct chemical interactions between them or they may influence each other’s uptake, translocation, and biological action via a number of mechanisms as exemplified for the case of ammonia.&lt;ref name="parent"&gt;Parent, S.-E. et al. 2013.

==Plant nutrition in agricultural systems==

===Hydroponics===
[[Hydroponics]] is a method for growing plants in a water-nutrient solution without the use of nutrient-rich soil. It allows researchers and home gardeners to grow their plants in a controlled environment. The most common solution is the [[Hoagland solution]], developed by D. R. Hoagland in 1933. The solution consists of all the essential nutrients in the correct proportions necessary for most plant growth.&lt;ref name="HunerHopkins2009"/&gt; An aerator is used to prevent an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] event or hypoxia. [[Hypoxia (environmental)|Hypoxia]] can affect nutrient uptake of a plant because, without oxygen present, respiration becomes inhibited within the root cells. The [[nutrient film technique]] is a hydroponic technique in which the roots are not fully submerged. This allows for adequate aeration of the roots, while a "film" thin layer of nutrient-rich water is pumped through the system to provide nutrients and water to the plant.

[[File:HelenHillListenTotheRoosterFeb06.jpg|thumb|We may appear to be listening when we are not]]
'''Pseudo-listening''' is a type of '''non-listening''' that consists of appearing attentive in conversation while actually ignoring or only partially listening to the other speaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/pseudolisten&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of pseudo-listening is not to listen, but to cater to some other personal need of the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Messages: The Communication Skill Book|last = McKay|first = Matthew|publisher = New Harbinger Publications|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-57224-592-1|location = Oakland, Ca|pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word pseudo-listening is a compound word composed of the individual words [[Pseudo-|pseudo]] (a Greek root meaning "not real or genuine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = pseudo {{!}} not real or genuine|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pseudo|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[listening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of listening|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/listening?s=t|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of pseudo-listening is trying to multitask by talking on the phone while watching television or completing work.&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpersonal Communication: Building Your Foundations for Success|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n9Txn-cKH80C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=pseudo+listening&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIy8qOtf21yAIVSD4-Ch1-NABD#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo%2520listening&amp;f=false|publisher = Kendall Hunt|date = 2004-08-01|isbn = 9780757509544|first = Michelle|last = Burch|first2 = Michelle Burch|last2 = Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-listening is the most ineffective way to communicate because after the conversation one will not have retained much of the information that was said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llangari|first1=Edwing|title=Pseudolistening|url=http://edwingllangari.efoliomn.com/pseudolistening|website=Edwing Llangari|publisher=myeflio|accessdate=10/9/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible reasons ==

# Listening for ways someone can reject you.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 9 Summary|url = http://faculty.mdc.edu/mroqueta/ch9summary.htm|website = Miami Dade College, Dr. Mildred Roqueta|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Forming your response to the speaker instead of focusing on what is being said.  
# Preoccupation, when there is too much on the mind of the listener, so that they cannot listen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 1973 annual handbook for group facilitators|last = Pfeiffer|first = William|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|year = 1973|isbn = 9780787903800|location = San Diego|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Preexisting familiarity with the topic of conversation, which results in less effort to actively listen. 
# Only listening for information you want to hear, giving little attention to the rest. 
# Listening only for the flaws in their argument in order to gain an advantage over the speaker. 
# Social pressure to be courteous to those speaking. 
# Hope that they will believe you are listening and return the favor. 
# An effort to build others' views of you. 
# Desire not to hurt someone who is sharing experiences.

== In comparison to active listening ==

Individuals who are pseudo-listening may include minimal encouragers to compensate for their non-listening, such as nodding their heads, looking at the speaker, smiling at the appropriate times, and displaying other aspects of paying attention, so it may be difficult at times to distinguish between active listening and pseudo-listening. Similarly, broad answers or responses that are not relevant to the topic at hand also give away a pseudo-listener. These responses are known as '''tangential responses''' and often run alongside the topic being discussed, but ultimately have nothing to do with the main topic of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Julia|title=Interpersonal Communication|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-285-44583-0|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper listening is needed to internalize and comprehend material; without this developed skill, there is potential for either pseudo-listening or a total lack of listening. A person who is truly listening may display certain body language such as maintaining eye contact or positioning their body towards the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Communication and Interpersonal Relationships - Counseling and Health Services|url = http://drexel.edu/healthservices/resources/students/communication/|website = Counseling and Health Services|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real listening is done with the intent to understand a person's perspective, enjoy a person's company, learn new information, or provide assistance or comfort, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intercultural communication: a teaching and learning framework {{!}} LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|url = https://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/paper/1303|website = www.llas.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it affects communication ==

Pseudo-listening is most common in face-to-face communication, but it can also be expressed through phone calls, text messages and e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Listen Like You Mean It|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-rosen/listen-like-you-mean-it_b_6136092.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective communication is dependent upon both the receiver and the sender to be fully aware of what is being said and heard. When one person projects their thoughts, and the receiver of the message is only pretending to listen, poor communication and possibly misunderstanding often occur. Babies spend their first few years listening to people around them in order to learn language (Childs, Acott-Smith, &amp; Curtis, 1999). According to Edwing Llangari people spend around half their lives listening to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://edwingllangari.efoliomn.com/pseudolistening|title = Edwing Llangari}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from University of Colorado states that poor listening skills make good communication pretty much impossible to achieve. It says that, "no matter how much care one person or group takes to communicate their concerns, values, interests, or needs in a fair, clear, unthreatening way, if the listener is not willing to receive that information in that way, the communication will fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I’m Sorry What Were You Saying? {{!}} A Look At Interpersonal Communication|url = http://blogs.longwood.edu/matthewmcpartland/2012/10/25/im-sorry-what-were-you-saying/|website = blogs.longwood.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With couples ===

There are many negative effects on romantic relationships caused by pseudo-listening. These effects can range from making romantic partners feel upset, inhibiting the partner's ability to effectively solve problems, encouraging an unhealthy dependence on the listener, raising the partner's level of stress, making the relationship, as a whole, less stable, causing the romantic partner to be less satisfied with the relationship, and even causing negative effects on the romantic partner's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are the consequences when you don't listen well?|url = http://www.youmeworks.com/consequences.html|website = www.youmeworks.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s important to recognize that there are two parts to any conversation, the person doing the talking and the person who is trying to actively listen.

=== With parents and children ===

Among families, teenagers engage in pseudo-listening the most. Teenagers may engage in pseudo-listening because they feel they have better things to do.They may also tune into distractions and act like they are listening. In doing so, it is evident that they listen only when they want to listen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ncur20.com/presentations/13/1388/paper.pdf|title = The Tricky Transition: Communication in the Mother and Adolescent-Daughter Relationship|last = Kraemer|first = Ashley A.|date = 2006|journal = UW-Whitewater Wisconsin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that as people get older, pseudo-listening skills increase. An experiment was done on first-grade and second grade children to see if they could repeat what the teacher had been saying. 90% of first graders and 80% of the second-graders could do so; but when the experiment was repeated with teenagers, only 44% of junior high students and 28% of senior high students could repeat their teachers’ remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baba|first1=Josephine|title=OVERCOMING CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE LISTENING-Faulty listening behavious|url=http://wecommunication.blogspot.com/2015/09/overcoming-challenges-to-effective.html|accessdate=Oct 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for parents to have good listening skills, because poor listening from parents can cause the child to be closed off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ncur20.com/presentations/13/1388/paper.pdf|title = The Tricky Transition: Communication in the Mother and Adolescent-Daughter Relationship|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In a classroom ===

[[File:Physical Sciences Classroom.jpg|thumb|Many students pseudolisten during class due to numerous distractions.]]
Recent studies reveal that students rarely encounter curriculum focused on learning and developing the skill of listening. It is possible for a student to go through every level of education without ever having a class teaching them how to listen effectively in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Who's Listening in the Classroom? A Research Paradigm.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED407659|date = 1997-03-14|first = Charles H.|last = Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often students fall victim to pseudo-listening because of all the distractions they have at their finger tips, such as phones, computers, social media, iPods, etc. Students will often pretend to be listening so that the professor of the class does not verbally chastise, or to avoid being perceived as rude. Effective listening from a teacher is a way of showing concern for their subordinates, which fosters cohesive bonds, commitment, and trust: this can help a class to pay attention and learn what is being taught.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Leaders===

Leadership often involves forming a commitment to the people one is leading, and a large part of this is related to active listening. Pseudo-listening undermines this commitment process and leads to ineffective leadership. Many people think they are listening to others all the time, and while they certainly may be hearing what these people are saying, they are engaging in pseudo-listening. Over time, pseudo-listening can not only weaken perceptions of one as  a leader, but can contribute to problems active listening could otherwise fix and lead to barriers against success in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/236257286?accountid=14472|title = The People Side of Leadership: An Overlooked Opportunity|last = Leheney|first = Mark|date = 2008|journal = Public Manager|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the job, we may need to appear interested in what others say because of their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication Mosaics: An Introduction to the Field of Communication|last = Wood|first = Julia|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2010|isbn = 9781111786366|location = |pages = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features that contribute ==
Things such as an accent, height, weight, scars, and even something as small as body posture can all contribute to an audience falling victim to pseudo-listening. Being self-conscious about some of these personal flaws as a speaker may inhibit the listeners experience. This lack of self-confidence could lead to other distractions made by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Be Less Self-Conscious|url = http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/01/26/how-to-be-less-self-conscious/|website = Psych Central.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt; While these physical flaws may lead to disinterest in the reader it could also contribute to nervous actions that may also distract the reader. A few examples of these nervous actions may include but are not limited to clenching your hands, adjusting your hair or clothing, and pacing back and forth while speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Public Speaking Habits To Avoid At All Costs|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/10-public-speaking-habits-to-avoid-2014-6|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions may lead to a disinterest in the context of a speech and an elevated interest in the person speaking or the environment surrounding them.

Environmental factors such as lighting, temperature, and furniture can affect the attention of the audience in relation to what the speaker has to say. Lighting that is too dark can make an audience tired and consequently disinterested in what the speaker has to say. Temperature and seating arrangements can distract an audience by causing them discomfort, shifting their focus to their own annoyance. Being too far from a speaker can also cause the audience to lose focus because of a sort of "[[Hawthorne effect]]. Physiological noise can also lead to distractions that take an audiences attention from the speaker. This noise may range from ailments and illness, all the way to emotions like arousal. Both sides of the spectrum can affect the audiences attention, for example, a speaker giving a speech while under the illness of a cold will have a stuffy nose or a recurring cough, which can take the audience's focus from the speaker to his cold. The audience can also be influenced by their own lives by shifting their focus on what they will eat for lunch, losing or finding a job, personal relationships, etc. These can all overshadow the messages and ideas that the speaker is trying to deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Listening|url = http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/a-primer-on-communication-studies/s05-listening.html|website = 2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facial features as distractions ===

[[File:Matt Wiman Pointy Mustache.jpg|thumb|Try listening to anything this guy has to say - you might find yourself pseudolistening]]
Because facial hair is a striking characteristic of one's face, people often notice and focus on an individual's facial hair. Because of this, listeners may fall victim to pseudolistening. Instead of making eye contact, listeners might focus on the speaker's mustache or beard instead of [[active listening|actively listening]]. Facial hair is distracting to both listeners and observers.This concept can also be applied to situations in which a person has something stuck in his teeth, has visible mucus in his nose, or has conspicuous piercings and tattoos on his face.

=== How to avoid it  ===
Effective listening is crucial to proper communication in everyday life. However, active listening is not a natural process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are You Really Listening?|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/02683949210018331|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology|pages = 17–21|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/02683949210018331|first = Marilyn M.|last = Helms|first2 = Paula J.|last2 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, even people who consider themselves good listeners often only listen with 25% efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Effective Listening|url = http://www.wright.edu/~scott.williams/LeaderLetter/listening.htm|website = www.wright.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Things Good Listeners Do Differently|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/habits-of-good-listeners_n_5668590.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active listening involves attentive body language, restating comments and emotions of the speaker, and repeating their ideas back in order to check comprehension accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Training Married Couples in Listening Skills: Effects on Behavior, Perceptual Accuracy and Marital Adjustment|jstor = 584144|journal = Family Relations|date = 1981-04-01|pages = 297–306|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/584144|first = Diana R.|last = Garland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to improve your listening skills. Begin by observing your conversations, and pay special notice to the times you begin to get distracted or ignore the other person and see how it affects your relationships. Once you understand your patterns in conversations, it's easier to change the negative aspects of your conversations. There are three main guidelines everyone should follow if they want to become effective listeners. The most important guideline is being mindful, that is, being disciplined and committed when trying to listen. The next guideline is adapting to listening appropriately because it is beneficial to be skilled in many listening behaviors and to know when each is important. The final guideline to becoming an effective listener is listening actively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpersonal Communication: Everyday Encounters|last = Wood|first = Julia|publisher = Cenage Learning|year = |isbn = 978-1-305-63452-7|location = Boston, Massachusetts|pages = 182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To listen actively, keep eye contact with the speaker, nod when a message is understood, etc. Paraphrasing what was said in order to communicate to the speaker that you understood their message correctly will also improve listening skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://faculty.northseattle.edu/wholt/bus236/lessons/s05files/listen2.pdf|title = Active Listening: Hear What People are Really Saying|date = |accessdate = 10/7/2015|website = MindTools|publisher = MindTools|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good tag phrase for paraphrasing is "What I'm hearing you say is...", followed by the question, "Is that right?" This combination of repeating back and asking for confirmation of accuracy frees the speaker to correct any previous ineffective communication.

=== Signs someone is not listening ===
One way to detect pseudolistening is eye fixation: in relaxed conversations, the eye tends to wander or look at other parts of your face. We also tend to smile at one another to reinforce that we agree with them and are listening. The pseudo-listener will do the same but will often smile for too long. During a conversation between two people, their bodies will face each other. A false listener, however, will not have engaged body language; instead, whether their feet face away or they sit next to rather than across from the other person, it is as if their body is trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7 Signs Someone's Not Listening To You|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/signs-someone-is-not-listening-2014-6|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* Ambushing: Waiting to trap the speaker in his/her own words or ideas; mostly used to support a belief or to prove something.
* Assimilation to Prior Messages: Believing new messages relate to past messages; forgetting that communication changes.
* Critical Listening: Not to be confused with defensive listening, critical listening is listening to analyze and understand the speaker's messages, written or spoken.&lt;ref name="Burch"/&gt; 
* Defensive Listening: A form of listening where the remarks by the speaker are taken personally, so the listener seeks a way to defend themselves against the perceived attack.&lt;ref name="Burch"/&gt;
* Filling in the Gaps: After hearing the beginning, assuming that the information given is the whole story.
* Insensitive Listening: Failing to notice hidden meanings or nonverbal cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poor Listening Habits|url = http://www.theexecutiveadvisory.com/toolkit/poor_listenting_habits.html|website = www.theexecutiveadvisory.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Insulated Listening: Avoiding certain topics.
* Selective Listening: Only paying attention to what one is interested in while ignoring and avoiding the rest of the information given.
* Stage-Hogging: Not really caring for what others have to say: only worried about yourself.

===False representations===

Auditory processing disorder is when a person "is perfectly aware of sounds" yet their brain abnormally deciphers the sounds. This could easily be confused with pseudo-listening because it effects a listeners' reading comprehension. The two differ because auditory processing disorder uncontrollable and unintentional, while pseudolistening is typically done purposely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The '''sharawadji effect''', not to be confused with [[sharawadgi]], is a [[musical perception]] or phenomenon regarding [[timbre]] and [[Texture (music)|texture]] described by Claude Shryer as, "a sensation of plenitude sometimes created by the contemplation of a complex [[soundscape]] whose beauty is inexplicable."&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Ellen and Harley, James. "Open Ears Festival of Music and Sound." ''Computer Music Journal'' 23.1 (1999): 79-82. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that sharawadji is not a stimulus, but rather a reaction to a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Musicworks 1998 p. 22"&gt;{{cite book |title=Musicworks |publisher=Music Gallery |issue=nos. 70-72 |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMY4AQAAIAAJ |access-date=13 September 2018 |pages=22 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shryer also elaborated on searching for this, "state of awareness," by the means of, "one tend[ing] an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context."&lt;ref&gt;Ulvaeus, edited by [[David Rothenberg]] &amp; Marta (2009). ''The Book of Music and Nature: An Anthology of Sounds, Words, Thoughts'' (Second edition. ed.). Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press. pp. 125. {{ISBN|9780819569356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One striking example of this effect is the appreciation of the sound of rumbling [[thunder]]: those who are being directly exposed to the element would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment. Simply understood, "sharawadji sounds belong to everyday life, to a known musical style. They become sharawadji only through decontextualization, through a rupture of meaning."&lt;ref name="Augoyard" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Seventeenth-century European travelers originally coined the term as an aesthetic effect that, "comes about as a surprise and will carry you elsewhere, beyond strict representation — out of context." The term ''sharawadji'' was speculated to originate from China and was understood as, "the beauty that occurs with no discernible order or arrangement".&lt;ref name="Augoyard"&gt;Augoyard, Jean François et al., eds. ''Sonic Experience: A Guide to Everyday Sounds''. Montreal ; Ithaca: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2006. Print. [http://xenopraxis.net/readings/augoyard_sonicexperiencecomplete.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

"All of us are searching for that enveloping soundscape that takes us beyond to indescribable realms of beauty, what the Persian philosophers once called the ''sharawadji effect''&lt;!--italics original--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, David (2013). ''Bug Music'', p.193. St. Martin's Press: New York. {{ISBN|978-1-250-00521-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slide library''' is a library that houses a collection of photographic [[reversal film|slides]], either as a part of a larger [[library]] or standing alone within a larger organization, such as an academic department of a college or university, a museum, or a corporation.  Typically, a "slide library" contains slides depicting [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[architecture]], or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of [[art history]], architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as [[biology]] and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as "Visual Resources Collections," as they may be responsible for all "visual" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:

* 35mm slides
* lantern slides
* mounted study photographs
* born digital images
* 35mm, 8mm film
Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously [[Library catalog|cataloged]] and [[Archive|inventoried]] slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, [[Digitizing|digitized]] slides and placed them online via [[content management systems]]. 

== History of visual resources collections ==

The first American [[lantern slide]] collections, developed by [[museum]]s to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: [[DePauw University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Rochester]]. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.

The first illustrated architectural history course west of the [[Mississippi]] was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1905.  The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides.  In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3"x 4.25".

The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film.  Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2"x2" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.

The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960.  The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.

== Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.==

1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25" x 4.0" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required [[lime light]] which was dirty and dangerous
 
1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed
 
1888. First perforated film stock developed
 
1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock
 
1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film

1905. UC Berkeley’s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher’s book, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''

1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust
 
1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography
 
1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film
 
1930.  Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)
 
1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle
 
1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base
 
1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets

1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides

It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e. [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK) and [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TUCE is in its fourth edition (2007) and is available, along with an examiner’s manual, for instructors, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The latest revision process, a joint effort between the NCEE and the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]], included a national norming consisting of 70 institutions across the United States spanning the four largest categories of the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].  The TUCE has two forms, one covering [[microeconomics]] and one covering [[macroeconomics]], each with thirty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items.  Each form includes three items covering [[international economics]].

'''Theory choice''' was a main problem in the [[philosophy of science]] in the early 20th century, and under the impact of the new and controversial theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum physics]], came to involve how scientists should choose between competing theories.

The classical answer would be to select the theory which was best verified, against which [[Karl Popper]] argued that competing theories should be subjected to comparative tests and the one chosen which survived the tests. If two theories could not, for practical reasons, be tested one should prefer the one with the highest degree of empirical content, said Popper in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''.

Mathematician and physicist [[Henri Poincaré]] instead, like many others, proposed [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2235317|title=Simplicity, Scientific Inference and Econometric Modelling|first1=Hugo A.|last1=Keuzenkamp|first2=Michael|last2=McAleer|date=1 January 1995|publisher=|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=105|issue=428|pages=1–21|doi=10.2307/2235317}}&lt;/ref&gt; One should choose the mathematically simplest or most elegant approach. Many have sympathized with this view, but the problem is that the idea of simplicity is highly intuitive and even personal, and that no one has managed to formulate it in precise and acceptable terms.

Popper's solution was subsequently criticized by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. He denied that competing theories (or [[paradigm]]s) could be compared in the way that Popper had claimed, and substituted instead what can be briefly described as pragmatic success. This led to an intense discussion with [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] the best known participants.

The discussion has continued, but no general and uncontroversial solution to the problem of formulating objective criteria to decide which is the best theory has so far been formulated. The main criteria usually proposed are to choose the theory which provides the best (and novel) predictions, the one with the highest explanatory potential, the one which offers better problems or the most elegant and simple one. Alternatively a theory may be preferable if it is better integrated into the rest of contemporary knowledge.

'''Transition Engineering''' is the professional engineering discipline that deals with the application of the principles of science to the design, innovation and adaptation of engineered systems that meet the needs of today without compromising the ecological, societal and economic systems on which future generations depend to meet their own needs. Just as [[safety]] considerations are incorporated into design parameters in all engineering fields, [[sustainability]] thinking is built into Transition Engineering. Transition engineering is emerging as a field to give engineers the tools necessary to address sustainability in design and management of engineered systems. Transition engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that addresses the issues of future resource availability and identifies, then realizes opportunities to increase [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].

== Overview ==

Engineering professions emerge when new technologies, new problems or new opportunities arise. This was the case when [[safety engineering]] grew in the early 1900s to combat the high workplace injury and fatality rates. In the 1960s, [[Environmental engineering]] emerged as a discipline to reduce industrial pollution and mitigate impacts on [[environmental health]] and [[water quality]]. [[Quality engineering]] came about with the increase in [[mass production]] techniques during WWII and the need to confirm the quality of the products.

There are two serious problems driving the emergence of Transition Engineering; the exponential growth in the concentration of [[carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere]] and the lack of growth and imminent decline of conventional oil production known as [[peak oil]]. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently exceeded 400ppm, a level that Earth has not known for 800,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=carbon_ppm_milestone&gt;{{cite news|last=Montaigne|first=Fen|title=Record 400ppm CO2 milestone 'feels like we're moving into another era'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/14/record-400ppm-co2-carbon-emissions|publisher=Guardian Environment Network|accessdate=2013-05-19|location=London|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Transition engineering aims to take advantage of the current access to the remaining lower cost and higher [[EROI]] energy resources to re-develop all aspects of urban and industrial engineered systems to adapt as fossil fuel use is dramatically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first=Susan|title=Transition Engineering of Urban Transportation for Resilience to Peak Oil Risks|journal=ASME 2011 International Mechanical Engineering Congress|date=2011-11-17|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The idea behind transition engineering has sprouted from many different roots, both technical and non-technical. The concept of [[sustainable development]] has been around since 1987 and the problem of [[sustainability]] was a driving force in the development of transition engineering. The [[Transition Town]] movement provided further inspiration as it showed that there were many groups of people around the world motivated to prepare for [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]]. [[Transition towns]] and [[ecovillages]] demonstrate the need for engineers to build systems that manage un-sustainable risks and provide people with [[sustainable]] options. Engineers are ethically required to "hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public" and answer society's need for sustainable development&lt;ref name=Code_of_ethics&gt;{{cite web|last=National Society of Professional Engineers|title=NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers|url=http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of [[safety engineering]] provided much of the inspiration for transition engineering. At the beginning of the 1900s, business owners viewed workplace safety as a wasted investment and politicians were slow to change. After the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire]] in [[New York City]] killed 156 trapped workers, 62 engineers came together to investigate how to make the workplace a safer place to be. This eventually lead to the formation of the [[American Society of Safety Engineers]].&lt;ref name=ASSE_history&gt;{{cite web|last=American Society of Safety Engineering|title=About ASSE -History|url=http://www.asse.org/about/history.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As safety engineering manages the risks of unsafe conditions, transition engineering manages the risks of unsustainable conditions. To give engineers a better grasp of sustainability, transition engineering defines the problem as UN-sustainability. This is similar to the problem of un-safe conditions that is the purpose of safety engineering. We do not necessarily know what a perfectly safe system looks like, but we do know what unsafe systems look like and how to improve them; the same applies to unsustainability of systems. By reducing unsustainability issues we take steps in the right direction&lt;ref name=survival_spectrum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan|title=The Survival Spectrum, the key to Transition Engineering of Complex Systems|journal=University of Canterbury, Mechanical Engineering|year=2010|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Seven Step Method ==

The Transition Engineering method involves 7 steps to help engineers develop projects to deal with changing unsustainable activities. As a discipline, Transition Engineering recognizes that "Business as Usual" projections of future scenarios from past trends are not valid because the underlying conditions have changed sufficiently from the conditions of the past. For example, the projection of future oil supply in 2050 from data prior to 2005 would give an expectation of a 50% increase in demand over that time-frame. However, the actual production rate of conventional oil has not increased since 2005 and is projected to decline by more than 50% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan |author2=Page, S. |author3=Dantas, A.|title=Urban form and long-term fuel supply decline: A method to investigate the peak oil risks to essential activities|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|year=2010|volume=5|issue=44|pages=306–322|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#History: First, historical data are gathered and historical trends understood in cultural and political contexts. All historical aspects of the system are considered. Transition Engineering investigates the effects that technology and social developments have on energy and resource demand. How did we get to where we are now? Why are we here? What factors put us here?
#Present: This step assesses the current situation. All current capabilities, investments, assets and condition/age of the assets, and liabilities are considered. Energy use is audited and its end-use behavior is assessed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Organisation for Standardisation|title=ISO 500001 Energy Management|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso50001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Future: Scenarios from all areas of study are considered to get a consensus view of both inertial trajectories of current trends, and limitations of carrying capacity and resource scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Shift Project|title=Science for Energy Scenarios|url=http://science-and-energy.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transition Engineers apply the science of climate change, petroleum geology, ecology, hydrology etc. to describe the "forward operating environment". Determining the probability of each future outcome creates a future operating environment envelope. This gives engineers and decision makers constraints with varying levels of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Energy Agency|title=IEA Scenarios and Projections|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Energy Information Administration|title=International Energy Outlook|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Path Break Concepts: Innovation takes place in this step when current assumptions about behavior and economics are set aside in favor of consideration of the forward operating environment at the end-point of the time-frame of study. The TE innovator places him/herself in the future and uses the future design constraints to come up with realistic and workable concepts. The path-break concept is not futuring.
#Backcasting: The path break concepts are analysed to see how they differ from the current situation. In this step, the barriers and strategies to change existing systems are also analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=The Natural Step|title=Backcasting|url=http://www.naturalstep.org/backcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Trigger Events: Although existing systems carry a large amount of inertia, if the right trigger is applied at the right time, a great amount of change is possible. Triggers can be either disastrous events such as economic collapse, or external changes such as a corporate merger, new law, or new staff. They can also be engineered change projects. The trigger event for safety engineering was the “Triangle shirtwaist factory fire.” (reference) The challenge is to communicate the advantages and benefits of adaptive change, and to initiate a disruptive event that enables an organization to get out of the rut. See [[Change Management]]
#Shift Projects: Finally, by planning for future supply and demand, change projects are realized to make best use of the current available resources. Through these projects, society will be more resilient to peak oil and climate change events.

== Global Association for Transition Engineering (GATE) ==

GATE opened the first group in the UK in Feb 2014. GATE is a Professional Engineering Institution; a membership association and learned society, and comprises an emerging network of engineers and non-engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other unsustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for example manufacturing, sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame are at odds with most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid stranded investment by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed.&lt;ref name="fishwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/cod/species_pages/atlantic_cod.htm|title=NOAA - FishWatch: Atlantic Cod|publisher=fishwatch.gov|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=International Society of Transition Engineering|title=ISTE|url=http://www.transitionengineering.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016. It is a "Charitable Incorporated Organisation" or CIO.

'''USPID''' (''Unione Scienziati per il Disarmo'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is the '''Italian Union of Scientists for Disarmament''', an association established in 1982 with the purpose of providing information about and analysis of arms control and [[disarmament]].

Members of USPID believe that this task is part of the social responsibility of scientists.

The issues addressed by USPID include [[nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]-control and disarmament, nuclear proliferation, consequences of nuclear explosions, control of fissile material, developments of military technology, conventional disarmament, chemical and biological disarmament, problems of conflicts and conflict resolution.

Members of USPID, both individually and collectively, share their views with Italian policy-makers and opinion-makers.

USPID organizes conferences and meetings, including the biennial Castiglioncello conference (now at its 11th edition), courses and seminars in Italian Universities, courses for high-school teachers.

USPID promotes the establishment of inter-departmental Centers affiliated to Italian Universities, and has actively collaborated for many years with the CIRP-UniBa (Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerche sulla Pace, [[University of Bari]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
