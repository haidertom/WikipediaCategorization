'''ASA style''' is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers in the field of [[sociology]]. It specifies the arrangement and punctuation of [[footnote]]s and [[bibliography|bibliographies]]. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA [[Style Guide]], which is published by the [[American Sociological Association]], the main scholarly organization for academic sociologists in the [[United States]]. The ''ASA Style Guide'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]], is designed to aid authors preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

==General features==

ASA style is closely related in appearance and function to APA (American Psychological Association) style. As with [[APA style]], the general format for citing references is [[parenthetical referencing]]. All references are to be included at the end of the paper in a section titled "References," rather than "Works Cited" as in [[MLA style]]. Also unlike MLA style, parenthetical references include the year of publication. The "author-date" in text citation system is a readily recognizable feature of ASA style. This emphasis on dates is carried over into the references section, where the date is the first piece of information to follow the author's or authors' name(s).

==Software support==

ASA style is supported by most major [[reference management software]] programs, including Endnote, Procite, Zotero, Refworks, and so forth, making the formatting of references a fairly straightforward task.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17422">{{Other uses|Anaphora (disambiguation){{!}}Anaphora}}
In [[linguistics]], '''anaphora''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|æ|f|ər|ə}}) is the use of an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression in context (its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] or postcedent). In a narrower sense, anaphora is the use of an expression that depends specifically upon an antecedent expression and thus is contrasted with [[cataphora]], which is the use of an expression that depends upon a postcedent expression. The anaphoric (referring) term is called an '''anaphor'''. For example, in the sentence ''Sally arrived, but nobody saw her'', the [[pronoun]] ''her'' is an anaphor, referring back to the antecedent ''Sally''. In the sentence ''Before her arrival, nobody saw Sally'', the pronoun ''her'' refers forward to the postcedent ''Sally'', so ''her'' is now a ''cataphor'' (and an anaphor in the broader, but not the narrower, sense). Usually, an anaphoric expression is a [[proform]] or some other kind of [[deixis|deictic]] (contextually-dependent) expression.&lt;ref&gt;Tognini-Bonelli (2001:70) writes that "an anaphor is a linguistic entity which indicates a referential tie to some other linguistic entity in the same text".&lt;/ref&gt; Both anaphora and cataphora are species of [[endophora]], referring to something mentioned elsewhere in a dialog or text.

Anaphora is an important concept for different reasons and on different levels: first, anaphora indicates how [[discourse]] is constructed and maintained; second, anaphora binds different [[Syntax|syntactical]] elements together at the level of the sentence; third, anaphora presents a challenge to [[natural language processing]] in [[computational linguistics]], since the identification of the reference can be difficult; and fourth, anaphora tells some things about how language is understood and processed, which is relevant to fields of linguistics interested in [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;The four ways just listed in which anaphora is important for linguistics are from McEnery (2000:3).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature and examples ==

The term ''anaphora'' is actually used in two ways.

In a broad sense, it denotes the act of referring. Any time a given expression (e.g. a proform) refers to another contextual entity, anaphora is present.

In a second, narrower sense, the term ''anaphora'' denotes the act of referring backwards in a dialog or text, such as referring to the left when an anaphor points to its left toward its antecedent in languages that are written from left to right. Etymologically, ''anaphora'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀναφορά (anaphorá, "a carrying back"), from ἀνά (aná, "up") + φέρω (phérō, "I carry"). In this narrow sense, anaphora stands in contrast to [[cataphora]], which sees the act of referring forward in a dialog or text, or pointing to the right in languages that are written from left to right: Ancient Greek καταφορά (kataphorá, "a downward motion"), from κατά (katá, "downwards") + φέρω (phérō, "I carry"). A proform is a cataphor when it points to its right toward its postcedent. Both effects together are called either anaphora (broad sense) or less ambiguously, along with [[self-reference]] they comprise the category of endophora.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the term ''endophora'', see Bussmann et al. (1998:58f.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of anaphora (in the narrow sense) and cataphora are given next. Anaphors and cataphors appear in bold, and their antecedents and postcedents are underlined:

::&lt;u&gt;'''Anaphora''' (in the narrow sense, species of endophora)&lt;/u&gt;

::a. Susan dropped &lt;u&gt;the plate&lt;/u&gt;. '''It''' shattered loudly. &lt;small&gt;- The pronoun ''it'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''the plate''.&lt;/small&gt;

::b. &lt;u&gt;The music stopped&lt;/u&gt;, and '''that''' upset everyone. &lt;small&gt;- The demonstrative pronoun ''that'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''The music stopped''.&lt;/small&gt;

::c. Fred was &lt;u&gt;angry&lt;/u&gt;, and '''so''' was I. &lt;small&gt;- The adverb ''so'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''angry''.&lt;/small&gt;

::d. If Sam &lt;u&gt;buys a new bike&lt;/u&gt;, I will '''do it''' as well. &lt;small&gt;- The verb phrase ''do it'' is an anaphor; it points to the left toward its antecedent ''buys a new bike''.&lt;/small&gt;

::&lt;u&gt;'''Cataphora''' (included in the broad sense of anaphora, species of endophora)&lt;/u&gt;

::a. Because '''he''' was very cold, &lt;u&gt;David&lt;/u&gt; put on his coat. &lt;small&gt;- The pronoun ''he'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''David''.&lt;/small&gt;

::b. '''His''' friends have been criticizing &lt;u&gt;Jim&lt;/u&gt; for exaggerating. &lt;small&gt;- The possessive adjective ''his'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''Jim''.&lt;/small&gt;

::c. Although Sam might '''do so''', I will not &lt;u&gt;buy a new bike&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- The verb phrase ''do so'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''buy a new bike''.&lt;/small&gt;

::d. In '''their''' free time, &lt;u&gt;the kids&lt;/u&gt; play video games. &lt;small&gt;- The possessive adjective ''their'' is a cataphor; it points to the right toward its postcedent ''the kids''.
&lt;/small&gt;

A further distinction is drawn between endophoric and [[exophora|exophoric reference]]. Exophoric reference occurs when an expression, an exophor, refers to something that is not directly present in the linguistic context, but is rather present in the situational context. Deictic proforms are stereotypical exophors, e.g.

::&lt;u&gt;'''Exophora'''&lt;/u&gt;

::a. '''This''' garden hose is better than '''that''' one. &lt;small&gt;- The demonstrative adjectives ''this'' and ''that'' are exophors; they point to entities in the situational context.&lt;/small&gt;

::b. Jerry is standing over '''there'''. &lt;small&gt;- The adverb ''there'' is an exophor; it points to a location in the situational context.&lt;/small&gt;

Exophors cannot be anaphors as they do not substantially refer within the dialog or text, though there is a question of what portions of a conversation or document are accessed by a listener or reader with regard to whether all references to which a term points within that language stream are noticed (i.e., if you hear only a fragment of what someone says using the pronoun ''her'', you may never discover who ''she'' is, though if you heard the rest of what the speaker was saying on the same occasion, you might discover who ''she'' is, either by anaphoric revelation or by exophoric implication because you realize who ''she'' must be according to what else is said about ''her'' even if ''her'' identity is not explicitly mentioned, as in the case of [[Homophora|homophoric reference]]).

A listener might, for example, realize through listening to other clauses and sentences that ''she'' is ''a Queen'' because of some of her attributes or actions mentioned. But which queen? Homophoric reference occurs when a generic phrase obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context. For example, the referent of the phrase ''the Queen'' (using an emphatic [[definite article]], not the less specific ''a Queen'', but also not the more specific ''Queen Elizabeth'') must be determined by the context of the utterance, which would identify the identity of the queen in question. Until further revealed by additional contextual words, gestures, images or other [[media (communication)|media]], a listener may not even know what monarchy or historical period is being discussed, and even after hearing ''her'' name is ''Elizabeth'' does not know, even if an English-UK Queen Elizabeth becomes indicated, if this queen means ''Queen Elizabeth I'' or ''Queen Elizabeth II'' and must await further clues in additional communications. Similarly, in discussing 'The Mayor' (of a city), the Mayor's identity must be understood broadly through the context which the speech references as general 'object' of understanding; is a particular human person meant, a current or future or past office-holder, the office in a strict legal sense, or the office in a general sense which includes activities a mayor might conduct, might even be expected to conduct, while they may not be explicitly defined for this office.

== In generative grammar ==
{{see also|Binding (linguistics)|Government and binding theory}}
The term ''anaphor'' is used in a special way in the [[generative grammar]] tradition of [[Chomsky]] and his followers. Here it denotes what would normally be called a [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] or [[reciprocal pronoun|reciprocal]] pronoun, such as ''himself'' or ''each other'' in English, and analogous forms in other languages. The use of the term ''anaphor'' in this narrow sense is unique to generative grammar, and in particular, to the traditional [[binding (linguistics)|binding]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional binding theory is associated above all with Chomsky's analysis from the early 1980s (Chomsky 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory investigates the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given proform and its antecedent (or postcedent). In this respect, anaphors (reflexive and reciprocal pronouns) behave very differently from, for instance, personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;See Büring (2005) for an introduction to and discussion of anaphors (in the sense of generative grammar) in the traditional binding theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complement anaphora ==
In some cases, anaphora may refer not to its usual antecedent, but to its [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] set. In the following example a, the anaphoric pronoun ''they'' refers to the children who are eating the ice-cream. Contrastingly, example b has ''they'' seeming to refer to the children who are not eating ice-cream:

::a. Only a &lt;u&gt;few of the children&lt;/u&gt; ate their ice-cream. '''They''' ate the strawberry flavor first. &lt;small&gt;- '''They''' meaning the children who ate ice-cream&lt;/small&gt;

::b. Only a &lt;u&gt;few of the children&lt;/u&gt; ate their ice-cream. '''They''' threw it around the room instead. &lt;small&gt;- '''They''' meaning either the children who did not eat ice-cream or perhaps the children who did not eat ice-cream and some of those who ate ice-cream but did not finish it or who threw around the ice-cream of those who did not eat it, or even all the children, those who ate ice-cream throwing around part of their ice-cream, the ice-cream of others, the same ice-cream which they may have eaten before or after throwing it, or perhaps only some of the children so that '''they''' does not mean to be all-inclusive&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="The Interpretation of Complement Anaphora: The Case of The Others by Nobuaki, Ursini"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U11-1017 | title=The Interpretation of Complement Anaphora: The Case of The Others | publisher=Proceedings of Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop | date=2011 | accessdate=28 July 2015 | authors=Nobuaki, Akagi, Ursini, Francesco-Alessio, both Centre for Cognition and its Disorders (CCD), Macquarie University | pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its narrower definition, an anaphoric pronoun must refer to some noun (phrase) that has already been introduced into the discourse. In complement anaphora cases, however, the anaphor refers to something that is not yet present in the discourse, since the pronoun's referent has not been formerly introduced, including the case of 'everything but' what has been introduced. The set of ice-cream-eating-children in example b is introduced into the discourse, but then the pronoun ''they'' refers to the set of non-ice-cream-eating-children, a set which has not been explicitly mentioned.&lt;ref name="Complement Anaphora and Interpretation by Rick Nouwens"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jos.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/1/73.short | title=Complement Anaphora and Interpretation | publisher=Journal of Semantics | work=Volume 20, Issue 1 Pp. 73-113. | accessdate=28 July 2015 | author=Nouwen, Rick }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[semantic]] and [[pragmatics]] considerations attend this phenomenon, which following [[discourse representation theory]] since the early 1980s, such as work by Kamp (1981) and Heim (File  Change  Semantics, 1982), and [[generalized quantifier theory]], such as work by Barwise and Cooper (1981), was studied in a series of psycholinguistic experiments in the early 1990s by Moxey and Sanford (1993) and Sanford et al. (1994).&lt;ref name="The Interpretation of Complement Anaphora: The Case of The Others by Nobuaki, Ursini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Communicating quantities: A psycho-logical perspective by Moxey, Sanford"&gt;{{cite web | title=Communicating quantities: A psycho-logical perspective | publisher=Laurence Erlbaum Associates | date=1993 | author=Moxey, L |author2=Sanford, A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In complement anaphora as in the case of the pronoun in example b, this anaphora refers to some sort of complement set (i.e. only to the set of non-ice-cream-eating-children) or to the [[maximal set]] (i.e. to all the children, both ice-cream-eating-children and non-ice-cream-eating-children) or some hybrid or variant set, including potentially one of those noted to the right of example b. The various possible referents in complement anaphora are discussed by Corblin (1996), Kibble (1997), and Nouwen (2003).&lt;ref name="Complement Anaphora and Interpretation by Rick Nouwens"/&gt; Resolving complement anaphora is of interest in shedding light on brain access to [[information]], [[calculation]], [[mental model]]ing, [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Resolving Complement Anaphora by Hadas Kotek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hkotek.com/Kotek%20-%20Resolving%20complement%20anaphora.pdf | title=Resolving Complement Anaphora | publisher=Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Anaphora Resolution (2008) | work=SSN 1736-6305 Vol. 2 | accessdate=28 July 2015 | author=Kotek, Hadas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mental models and the interpretation of anaphora | publisher=Hove, UK: Psychology Press | date=2001 | author=Garnham, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anaphora resolution – centering theory ==
There are many theories that attempt to prove how anaphors are related and trace back to their antecedents, with centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) being one of them. Taking the computational theory of mind view of language, centering theory gives a computational analysis of underlying antecedents. In their original theory, Grosz, Joshi, &amp; Weinstein (1983) propose that some discourse entities in utterances are more 'central' than others, and this degree of centrality imposes constraints on what can be the antecedent. 

In the theory, there are different types of centers: forward facing, backwards facing, and preferred. 

=== Forward facing centers ===

A ranked list of discourse entities in an utterance. The ranking is debated, some focusing on theta relations (Yıldırım et al. 2004) and some providing definitive lists.

=== Backwards facing center ===

The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance. 

=== Preferred center ===

The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance realised in the current utterance.

'''Arcadian ecology''' is a [[school of thought]] that advocates for a harmonious relationship between humans and nature. It is named for the mountainous [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcady]] region of Greece. Gilbert White's seminal piece "Natural History of Selbourne" promotes a benign attitude towards nature and advocates for a [[peaceful coexistence]] between organisms. It was an individual realization of ancient arcadian ideas of harmonious interactions between humans and nature. The evolution of Arcadian ecological thought continuously reverts to the detailed letters and poems in this work.&lt;ref&gt;Worster, Donald. ''Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Gilbert. The natural history and antiquities of Selborne. Methuen: The Aberdeen University Press Limited, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

The harmonious relationship described by Arcadian ecology establishes a responsibility to resist the domination of nature. Donald Worster in his book, ''Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas'', uses Imperial ecology as a counterpoint to Arcadian ecology. Imperial ecology takes a different approach, and suggests that humans should attempt to manage nature, because nature exists for man's benefit ([[utilitarianism]]). This contradiction is representative of the ecologists' struggle  to explain humanity's relationship with nature while considering popular theological views of the time period. The discussion of Arcadian versus Imperial ecology would continue with prominent figures of the field such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. The long term implications of this debate have the potential to shape nature in the future as humans struggle with ethical debates and laws for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Arcadian standpoint has its roots in several historical and cultural traditions which have shaped the study of [[ecology]]. One of these such cultural traditions was the [[Renaissance]], which cultivated the appreciation of [[landscape]], [[wilderness]], and nature. [[Environmental sociologist]] Kris van Koppen&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Persons/Kris-van-Koppen-1.htm dr.ir. C.S.A. (Kris) van Koppen, CV]&lt;/ref&gt; underscores this point by arguing, "The social theories that belong to the arcadian approach are particularly orientated to the recognition, elaboration and extension of the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s of nature, as well as to the social organization of their [[conservation biology|preservation]]".&lt;ref name=vKoppen&gt;van Koppen, C.S.A.(Kris). "Resource, Arcadia, Lifeworld. Nature Concepts in Environmental Sociology." Sociologia Ruralis 3 (2000): 300-318. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcadian ecology can be understood by its contrasts with another prominent view, Imperial Ecology. Sociologists and historians define Imperial Ecology as the standpoint that nature is a force to be dominated in the quest for human [[convenience]]. It is in this difference that it can be clearly seen that the arcadian approach criticizes 'resourcism' and 'reductionism'.&lt;ref name=vKoppen/&gt; Therefore, sociologists and ecologists who subscribe to the notion of arcadian ecology view natural disasters like the [[Dust Bowl]] as stemming directly from conceptions of nature like imperial ecology.

Within arcadian ecological thought, there has been a recent focus on the relationship between humans and animals. This comes primarily from Keith Tomas and his work ''Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500–1800'' published in 1983. This contribution began to highlight [[animal rights]] and the inhumane treatment of animals between 1500 and 1800. In a similar vein, Lynn White reflected on the shift from the biblical idea that animals were put on earth to serve man, to the realization that man must live in harmony with beast.&lt;ref&gt;White, L. ''The historical roots of our ecological crisis'' Science 155 (3767). 1967. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical implications==

Ethical and political implications of the Arcadian Ecology viewpoint are ever popular in scholarly and media debates during the twenty-first century. The debate however, did not begin during the current time but rather has progressed over many centuries as humans attempt to grapple with their short-term and long-term [[environmental impact]]. [[Max Oelschlaeger]] remarks, "Nearly 50 years ago [[Aldo Leopold]] identified the basic problem of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]: learn how to live on the land without spoiling it".&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It would also not even be fifteen years later when [[Rachel Carson]] wrote about [[Neanderthal science]] and its unreflective practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States conservation debate===
A more reflective look at the United States' environmental practices can show in depth the struggle of a relatively new country, with substantial economic means, to come to an agreement on appropriate actions regarding nature. Historically the United States has had significant expansion and [[over-resourcing]]. The many [[national park]]s and government-protected environmental lands were in part created because there was over-framing and development. [[Teddy Roosevelt]] used his position as the United States President to set aside more than 194 million acres of park land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2008/09/teddy-roosevelt-and-the-adirondack-forest-preserve.html&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Jacoby, an expert in environmental history, has written how the [[Adirondack Park]] in New York was created to ensure a continued water source to the New York City population and a natural environment to “recharge” from city life.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Karl. ''Crimes against nature: Squatters, poachers, thieves, and the hidden history of American conservation''. University of California Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all United States National Parks were created for reasons other than [[nature preservation]], such as [[Yosemite National Park]]. Originally it was set aside as land to be undeveloped by those who predicted that land conservation may become important in the future. For classification purposes, those ecologists that saw a need to refuse a developmental and destructive path for Yellowstone ascribe to the arcadian ecology view. However, this originally Arcadian movement was opposed, when San Francisco need a viable water supply after a devastating earthquake. This conservation issue sparked a major debate over the [[Hetch Hetchy]]. The debate pitted major thinkers against each other including [[John Muir]] who thought there was "no holier temple than Yosemite" and [[Gifford Pinchot]] who was in favor of damming to provide water resources to San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stradling, David. ''Conservation in the Progressive Era: Classic Texts''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hetch Hetchy examines the dichotomy of arcadian and imperial ecology.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In addition to National Parks, the United States has put many laws into motion regarding environmental protection including the National Environmental Policy Act (1969), the Wilderness Act (1964), and the [[Endangered Species Act (1973)]]. These laws all celebrate the Arcadian harmony between nature and humans and ensure its preservation. Unfortunately, Americans, according to Max Oelschlaeger, are also, "the world’s leading consumers: our ecological footprints tread heavily on other parts of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems in determining if there has been success in terms of the environment in the United States is the subjectivity that comes with this environmental issue. A look at the work by Eliot Brownlee, a professor of economic history, will suggest that the United States is an economic success story that utilized the natural resources to the best of their abilities. The view looks at nature not as a pawn, but a means to an end in production which has advanced the human race further than ever thought possible.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, Eliot. 1974, The Dynamics of Ascent: A History of the American Economy. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, a prominent environmental philosopher, [[Joseph Petulla]], wrote a different story of the landscape of Brownlee. He saw the economic success coming at a costly price of the [[habitat destruction|destruction of the American land]]. [[Western civilization]] had encroached too far into nature and it was more reminiscent of Imperial Ecology rather than Arcadian Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Petulla, Joseph M. American environmental history. Columbus, OH: Merrill Publishing Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bauer's Lexicon'''''&lt;!--book title abbreviations are capitalized--&gt; (also '''''Bauer Lexicon''''' and '''''Bauer's Greek Lexicon''''') is among the most highly respected dictionaries of [[Biblical Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Rykle Borger, "Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Wörterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis," Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Taylor (et al., eds.), pp. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the German forerunner are Erwin Preuschen and [[Walter Bauer]]. The English edition is '''''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature''''' (the 3rd edition was published in 2001 by the [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0226039331}}).

== History ==
The origin may be traced to Erwin Preuschen's ''Vollständiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1515/zatw.1908.28.4.U | title =  Vollständiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur |trans-title= Full Greek-German Concise Dictionary of the New Testament writings and other early Christian literature| journal = Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft [Journal of Old Testament Studies] | first = D. E.| last= Preuschen| language = German| volume = 28 | issue = 4 | year = 1908 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bauer extensively revised this work, as ''Griechisch-deutsches Wörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur''. 

In the fall of 1949, [[F. Wilbur Gingrich]] was granted a leave of absence from [[Albright College]] to work on a new Greek-English lexicon of the [[New Testament]], translating and adapting the work of [[Walter Bauer]]’s Greek-German lexicon (Bauer lexicon) in collaboration with Dr. William F. Arndt. The work actually took 5 ½ years.

The fourth German edition (1949–52) was translated to English by William F. Arndt and F. Wilbur Gingrich in 1957. Arndt died that same year, to be replaced by [[Frederick William Danker]], with whom Gingrich prepared the second English edition published in 1979.

A sixth German edition was published following Bauer's death in 1960, by [[Kurt Aland]], Barbara Aland and Viktor Reichmann. Gingrich died in 1993, leaving Danker to complete the 3rd English edition based on all the prior editions and substantial work of his own.

The second edition, '''''Bauer-Danker Greek Lexicon of the New Testament''''', was commonly known as '''''BAGD''''' ('''''Bauer–Arndt–Gingrich–Danker'''''). Danker published the third English edition in 2000. Given the extensive improvements in this edition (said to include over 15,000 new citations), it is now known as '''''Bauer–Danker–Arndt–Gingrich''''' ('''''BDAG''''') or sometimes the '''''Bauer-Danker Lexicon'''''.

A notable feature of the third English edition is vastly improved typography. This reflects early adoption of [[SGML]] technology. The entire lexicon was converted to SGML in the late 1980s at [[Dallas Seminary]] with collaboration from SGML experts interested in the project, and Danker actually did substantial editorial and authorial work in an SGML editing program. This technology permitted much more consistent and flexible typography, as well as information retrieval.

A Chinese translation of the lexicon, based on the third English edition, was published in 2009 in Hong Kong by Chinese Bible International Limited.

'''Black Patch Park''' is a [[park]] in [[Smethwick]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England. It is bounded by Foundry Lane, Woodburn Road, Perrott Street and Kitchener Street, at {{gbmapping|SP038888}}.

The park, covering over {{convert|20|acre|m2}}, was part of a sparsely populated landscape of commons and woodland (known as '''The Black Patch'''), dotted with farms and cottages which has been transformed from heath to farmland then to a carefully laid out municipal park surrounded by engineering companies employing thousands of people; [[Richard Tangye|Tangyes]], Nettlefolds, (later [[GKN plc]]), the [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]], Birmingham Aluminium Castings, ironworks, glassmaking and brewing. These factories, including the [[Soho Foundry]], started by [[Boulton and Watt|James Watt and Matthew Boulton]] are, but for foundations and frontages, almost all gone.&lt;ref name="SLHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dumbleton-williams.fsnet.co.uk/SMETHWICKLOCALHISTORYSOCIETY.htm|title=EE|website=EE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of what is known about Black Patch Chaplin Park appears in a book by Ted Rudge, developed from an [[Open University]] degree thesis, and published by Birmingham City Council in 2003. Rudge's research records how, from the mid-19th century until they were evicted from it at the start of the 20th, the 'Black Patch' was the camping ground of a community of tent and [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|vardo]] (caravan) dwellers who were to become integrated with 'gaujos' (non-Gypsies) in surrounding districts.  The Gypsies on the Black Patch lived on a deep barren layer of furnace waste, which, after their eviction, was cleared down to grass growing soil to create a park.&lt;ref name="RudgeBook"&gt;Ted Rudge ''Brumroamin: Birmingham and Midland Romany Gypsy and Traveller Culture''. Birmingham City Council Department of Leisure &amp; Community Services (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; There is disputed evidence that [[Charlie Chaplin]] might have been born at Black Patch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/17/charlie-chaplin-gypsy-heritage|title=Was Charlie Chaplin a Gypsy?|first=Matthew|last=Sweet|date=17 February 2011|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117714/Was-Charlie-Chaplin-born-gypsy-caravan-West-Midlands-Letter-locked-away-decades-hold-answer-mystery-MI5-CIA-solve.html|title=Was Charlie Chaplin born in a gypsy caravan in the West Midlands?

== Situation ==
[[Image:Boundarybrook.jpg|thumb|right|Boundary Brook]] 
Black Patch Park lies 2½ miles from [[Birmingham]] city centre just outside the boundary of the city, and is surrounded north, east and south by railway embankments. One of these carries the Birmingham - Wolverhampton part of [[West Coast main line]]. That and the [[A41 road|A41]] and the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]' Birmingham to Wolverhampton '[[BCN Main Line|Mainline]]' canals - old and new - are arteries of the region's 'North West Corridor of Regeneration'.

In the centre of Black Patch Park, Boundary Brook, which for centuries marked a boundary between [[Staffordshire]] and [[Warwickshire]], meets [[Hockley Brook]], which once separated the country villages of [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] and [[Smethwick]].&lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; Boundary Brook enters from the South, while Hockley Brook comes in from the West under Woodburn Road.

The Park is linked to the Birmingham main line canal via a route through Avery Road that connects it to the West Midlands [[Sustrans]] Cycle Route 5, running along the canal towpath, part of a National Cycle Network running from the Cotswolds via Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick, Birmingham, and Stafford to Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire.

Black Patch Park is edged by Foundry Lane to the west and south, Woodburn Road to the north, and to the east, Perrott Street, beyond which, as far as Handsworth New Road, stretches the triangle of Merry Hill Allotment Gardens. The [[Midland Metro]] has two stops nearby - Winson Green Outer Circle and Handsworth Booth Street. Kitchener Street which, until they were demolished in 1980, ran between terraced houses, was gated in January 2009 under section 129A of the Highways act 1980 - a measure intended by Sandwell MBC to prevent extensive fly-tipping.

== Industrial Revolution ==
[[Image:MerryHillAllots.jpg|left|245px|thumb|Merry Hill Allotments 2004]]
In 1769 [[James Brindley]] supervised the building of a canal between Birmingham and the [[Black Country]]. This waterway came to be known, within 60 years, as the 'old' Main Line Canal after [[Thomas Telford]] constructed a straighter, broader New Birmingham Main Line Canal, which opened in 1829 to carry an ever-increasing volume of [[narrow boat]] traffic. Brindley and Telford's waterways attracted industrial entrepreneurs including [[Matthew Boulton]], and [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] who bought {{convert|18|acre|m2}} by the canal at Merry Hill, about a mile from the firm's [[Soho Manufactory]] in Handsworth and opened the [[Soho Foundry]]&lt;ref name="Avery"&gt;[http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.2&amp;title=The+Soho+Foundry Avery Weigh-Tronix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223060740/http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.2&amp;title=The+Soho+Foundry |date=2006-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1796 'for the purpose of casting everything relating to our steam engines'.

As the local population grew, tension developed between them and the travellers. Rudge&lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; records that Gypsies and travellers camped on the "Black Patch" from the mid-19th century, not always with approval of local people. Only in the early 20th century, and after several attempts, were the Gypsies finally and forcibly evicted from the 'Black Patch' as rising population density and new land owning assumptions placed greater and greater restriction on their traditional sites.

From being a thriving industrial site, the area was transformed in little more than a lifetime, to a site of dereliction{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}, with the decline of almost all the park's surrounding industrial giants during the economic upheaval of the 1960s. One successful survivor is [[Avery Weigh-Tronix]] on Foundry Lane, the world's largest manufacturers of machines for weighing, counting, measuring and testing, whose main entrance is the frontage of Boulton's and Watt's old Soho Foundry opposite the 'Soho Foundry Tavern'.

== Gypsy connection ==
[[Image:GypsiesBlackPatch.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Gypsies on the Black Patch]]Rudge &lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; says that Esau Smith was the acknowledged king of the Black Patch. When he died in 1901 at the age of 92, his widow Henty was elected queen. Even while Esau was alive it was generally understood by local people that the Gypsies gained legal rights to the land as squatters. Though such rights are seldom written down, it is said that deeds to this effect were destroyed when the king and queen's caravan was ritually burned after her death on 7 January 1907. Queen Henty, who was buried with her husband in the churchyard of [[St. Mary's Church, Handsworth]], is said to have placed a curse on anyone who builds over the Black Patch, the subject of a song by the well known folk artist Bryn Phillips in September 2003.&lt;ref name="RudgeWeb"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080704181010/http://www.ted.rudge.btinternet.co.uk/id42.htm Ted Rudge's web pages on a campaign to save Black Patch Park](including the full text of Bryn Phillips song)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Mrs E J E Pilkington and Tangye Ltd were referred to as legal owners of Black Patch, having put it up for sale after employing land agents to carry out a court imposed eviction of the Gypsies on 26 July 1905. They did not finally relinquish links with the land until a "peaceful eviction" was negotiated by Birmingham Corporation Parks Department on 15 February 1909.&lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; Subsequent stories contribute to reasonable doubt as to who ought to have inherited the Black Patch and who now holds legal title to the Gypsies' old camping ground. Rudge&lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; reports that in 1960 Jane Badger, who lived near Black Patch, got into conversation while walking by the Park with a gentleman with an American accent. He claimed he owned the deeds to the land. This story resembles a statement made by Ray Plant,&lt;ref name="RudgeBook"/&gt; a distant relative of the Black Patch Gypsies, that a family called Murdock once owned the land and gave permission to camp there. According to Ray Plant when the Murdocks emigrated to America they handed over the Black Patch deeds to the Gypsies. The deeds were apparently stolen making any of the gypsies  claims to the land unfounded. Many of the gypsy descendants still live in the surrounding area - the names of descendants accessible via the [[National Census]].&lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt;

In July 2005, a memorial plaque to the gypsies was erected.&lt;ref name="RudgeMemorial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906150029/http://www.ted.rudge.btinternet.co.uk/romany_memorial.htm|title=Wayback Machine|date=6 September 2008|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime in March 2007 this plaque disappeared but has since been replaced.

== Creating the Park ==
Despite past and present doubts &lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; about exact ownership the impetus for and organisation of its purchase and development as a public park came from the Birmingham Playgrounds, Open Spaces and Playing Fields Society, chaired by John Nettlefold, a Birmingham Councillor, married into the [[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] family. A mix of public subscription and cash from Smethwick and Handsworth Councils and [[Birmingham City Council|Birmingham Corporation]] raised £12,200.&lt;ref name="RudgeBook"/&gt; One of the vendors, Mrs Pilkington, donated £500 from the conveyance to assist with their aim of providing a place where people could enjoy fresh air away from the smoky atmosphere of the surrounding factories. The new public space was divided into three; {{convert|6|acre|m2}} in Handsworth, seven in Smethwick and seven in Birmingham. Further land was acquired to build Perrott Street, widen the [[Great Western Railway]] and provide the Merry Hill Allotments on the other side of Perrott Street. Birmingham Corporation was asked by the Society to lay out and manage Black Patch Park. Unemployed people under the supervision of a Parks' Superintendent carried out this work. It began in January 1909 and was completed in May 1910. The Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Alderman Bowater, formally opened the Black Patch Recreation Ground on 20 June 1911. In 1966 management was taken over by the new Borough of Warley, now [[Sandwell]] Metropolitan Council, whose Planning Department confirms that covenants held by Pilkington and Tangye still exist,&lt;ref name="RudgeBook" /&gt; but until then Black Patch Park was under the stewardship of Birmingham Parks Department.

== Campaign to save Black Patch Park ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SaveBlackPatchPark.jpg|300px|right|Young player on the Black Patch]]  --&gt;
In August 2003 a campaigning group called "The Friends of Black Patch Park" &lt;ref name="RudgeWeb" /&gt; was formed to challenge proposals outlined in Sandwell Council's Unitary Development Plan to zone two thirds of the park for industrial use. The aim of the Friends of Black Patch Park has been to protect, celebrate and enhance the park's {{convert|20|acre|m2}} - as originally created by public subscription in 1907 - as a place of historic importance and indispensable green space for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracystreet.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/black-patch-park.html|title=Black Patch Park - striving to renew a place|website=democracystreet.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its legacy as a traditional Romany camping ground, the park's current value is as a wildlife oasis, a place for quiet walks and relaxation and an essential site for a large number of young people from diverse backgrounds to practice sport. Footballers from the Soho Foundry Tavern and many other Warley League Teams, are strongly against the loss of the playing fields that make up the largest part of the Black Patch.

== Regeneration? ==
Agenda item 5 of a Report to the Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Transport, Councillor Bob Badham, [[Sandwell|Sandwell MBC]], dated 21 February 2007, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Within the adopted Unitary Development Plan, sites around Black Patch Park, near to the Soho Foundry were allocated for industrial uses in order to attract investment for a Technology Park. However, this has not come to fruition. A recent Employment Land Survey has revealed that there is no immediate need for further industrial land in this location. As there are no deliverable proposals identified, and to accommodate the wishes of Friends of Black Patch Park to retain the Park area, these allocations have been removed. The land will therefore form a green focal point for any development which takes place on the adjoining sites. The Preferred Option for land adjacent to Soho Foundry has been allocated for Mixed Used which can incorporate industrial and offices, and possibly leisure, community and educational facilities associated to the Foundry once a suitable re-use has been identified. Smethwick Area Action Plan - Preferred Option Document (Cabinet Forward Plan Ref. No. RT089). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 30th August 2017 Sandwell MBC Cabinet, under the leadership of Cllr Steve Eling, agreed a policy to rezone land around Black Patch Park for housing. On 16th January 2018 Full Council received and approved the minutes of Cabinet to the effect that:
&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) that the proposals for a land use change to the sites in the Black Patch area, Smethwick to that of residential be noted;
(2) that a masterplan and Interim Planning Statement be prepared as the way forward for the Black Patch, Smethwick area;

(3) that in connection with Resolution (2) above, a further report be submitted to the Cabinet on the draft masterplan and Interim Planning Statement prior to public consultation being undertaken;
(4) that consultation be undertaken with Merry Hill Allotment plot holders to consider relocation to an alternative allotment site and the results of the consultation be submitted to Cabinet in due course.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Byzantine Fresco Chapel''' is a part of the [[Menil Collection]] in [[Houston, Texas]], near the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]]. From February 1997 to February 2012, it displayed the only intact [[Byzantine]] [[frescoes]] of this size and importance in the entire western hemisphere. The Byzantine frescoes had been taken from the church of [[Church of Saint Evphemianos, Lysi|St. Evphemianos]] in [[Lysi]], [[Cyprus]] in the 1980s. In September 2011, the collection announced that the frescos would be permanently returned to Cyprus in February 2012, following the conclusion of a long-term loan agreement with the [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903703604576587072924927678 "From Texas at Age 700"].

Retrieved January 8, 2017. {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frescoes had been presented at the museum by agreement with the Church of Cyprus, their owners, but the church decided not to extend the loan further. They will not return to their original home as Lysi is now in [[Northern Cyprus]], but will be displayed at the Byzantine Museum in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/09-23-11-20-43-menil-returning-byzantine-frescoes-to-cypress/ "See them while you can: Menil returning Byzantine frescoes to Cyprus in February 2012"]. ''Houston Culturemap'', September 23, 2011. Retrieved September 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2012, the Byzantine Fresco Chapel closed, but re-opened in 2015 for the first in a series of site-specific projects.

==History==
The chapel was opened in February 1997, and displayed masterworks from the 13th century—a dome with [[Christ Pantocrator]] and an [[apse]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] the [[Panayia]]. The frescoes had been stolen from a chapel near Lysi in the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish-occupied]] section of [[Cyprus]] in the 1980s, cut into 38 pieces, and shipped to Germany by thieves to sell them in the arts black-market.&lt;ref name="Slessor, Christine 1998"&gt;Slessor, Christine. "Out of this world&amp;nbsp;– Chapel Museum, Houston, Texas&amp;nbsp;– Glass and Transparency." ''The Architectural Review''. May, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The 38 fresco fragments were bought from the thieves by the Houston-based Menil Foundation on behalf of the Church of Cyprus, the rightful owner of the frescoes. The Menil Foundation then funded a careful restoration of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Menil Collection website"&gt;[https://www.menil.org/exhibitions/226-byzantine-fresco-chapel Byzantine Fresco Chapel]. ''www.menil.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; These intact frescoes were unique in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Menil Collection website" /&gt;

==The original collection==
[[File:Lysi-dome.jpg|thumb|left|Dome from church in Lysi, Cyprus depicting Christ the Pantokrator]]
The major part of the collection consisted of the frescoes of the dome and apse. According to the guide to the museum, "the Lysi dome represents Christ Pantokrator, 'All sovereign'. It defines a space with no beginning and no end."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guide to the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Christ gazing directly forward "has driven time out of space. His gaze is transworldly: not looking but all-seeing."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; By not depicting the Lord below the bust, he is "universal and ubiquitous."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Surrounding the figure of Christ is a double row of angels moving towards the throne prepared by God the Father for the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. The throne is guarded by the [[Archangel Michael]] and [[Archangel Gabriel]] and two [[seraphim]]. The [[Virgin Mary]] leads one line of angels to the throne, while [[John the Baptist]] leads the other.

In the apse, the Virgin was depicted as flanked by the two archangels with a medallion on her breast of the infant Christ, symbolizing the [[Incarnation]] of Christ.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:ByzantineChapelMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Church within a Museum; the glass and wood chapel that housed the only intact Byzantine frescoes in the Western hemisphere]]
The {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} $4 million building was designed by architect [[François de Menil]]. The interior combines rough stone, opaque glass, and rich woods, to create a space that is both art museum and spiritual space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/museumpages/museumpage.asp?MID=15 "Byzantine Fresco Chapel"]. ''Houston Museum District''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208080959/http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/museumpages/museumpage.asp?MID=15 |date=February 8, 2012}}. Retrieved January 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspended-glass "walls" are not replicas of the chapel that the frescoes were removed from, but created a new context for displaying the icons. In order not to simply replicate the original chapel, de Menil designed "a mediating external building with an embedded steel structure&amp;nbsp;– a 'reliquary box'&amp;nbsp;– which forms a neutral enclosure for a freestanding chapel," according to Christine Slessor in ''The Architectural Review''.&lt;ref name="Slessor, Christine 1998" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Byzantine Chapel Museum is a religious building whose purpose is to restore spiritual significance and function to two thirteenth-century Byzantine Frescoes, a dome and an apse, rescued and restored by the owner ... The materiality of the original chapel is shattered and made ephemeral through the fragmented, freestanding sandblasted laminated glass structure which is an abstracted evocation of the original chapel. The infinite is evoked through the play of darkness and light." François de Menil, May 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dupont.com/safetyglass/lgn/stories/0802.html "Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum uses sandblasted laminated glass to restore spiritual significance"]. ''Laminated Glass News'', E.I. Dupont de Nemours Company. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Byzantine chapel is oriented to face the cardinal directions&amp;nbsp;– the facades face directly north, south, east and west. The enclosed space measures approximately {{convert|116000|cuft|m3}}. There are no windows on the surface area of the building, except for a skylight of {{convert|1012|sqft|m2}} of clear, double glazed glass, which permits natural light to pervade the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Allan V.

White dwarfs resist [[gravitational collapse]] primarily through [[electron degeneracy pressure]] (compare [[main sequence]] stars, which resist collapse through [[Pressure#Pressure of an ideal gas|thermal pressure]]). The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, a white dwarf with a mass greater than the limit is subject to further gravitational collapse, [[Stellar evolution|evolving]] into a different type of [[Compact star|stellar remnant]], such as a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 page 44, Accessed Oct. 7, 2013, "...Chandrasekhar limit: The maximum mass of a white dwarf star, about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Above this mass, the gravitational pull becomes too great, and the star must collapse to a neutron star or black hole..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit was named after [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], the Indian [[astrophysicist]] who improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 20, in [[India]] by calculating the limit for a polytrope model of a star in hydrostatic equilibrium, and comparing his limit to the earlier limit found by [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|E. C. Stoner]] for a  uniform density star.  Importantly, the existence of a limit, based on the conceptual breakthrough of  combining relativity with  Fermi degeneracy, was indeed first established  in separate  papers published by [[Wilhelm Anderson]] and E. C. Stoner in 1929.  The limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of [[black hole]]s, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. That the roles of Stoner and Anderson are often forgotten in the astronomy community has been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Eric G. Blackman, "Giants of physics found white-dwarf mass limits", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Natur.440..148B ''Nature'' 440, 148 (2006)] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:WhiteDwarf mass-radius en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Radius–mass relations for a model white dwarf. The green curve uses the general pressure law for an ideal [[Fermi gas]], while the blue curve is for a non-relativistic ideal Fermi gas. The black line marks the [[ultrarelativistic limit]].]]

Electron degeneracy pressure is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] effect arising from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Since [[electron]]s are [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can be in the same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a [[Electronic band structure|band]] of [[energy levels]]. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons increases on compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of [[electron capture]], relieving the pressure.

In the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an [[equation of state]] of the form {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|5|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|P}} is the [[pressure]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[mass density]], and {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant.  Solving the hydrostatic equation leads to a model white dwarf that is a [[polytrope]] of index {{sfrac|3|2}} – and therefore has radius inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass, and volume inversely proportional to its mass.&lt;ref name="chandra3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S. | year = 1931 | title = The Density of White Dwarf Stars | url = | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 592–596 | doi=10.1080/14786443109461710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mass of a model white dwarf increases, the typical energies to which degeneracy pressure forces the electrons are no longer negligible relative to their rest masses. The velocities of the electrons approach the speed of light, and [[special relativity]] must be taken into account. In the strongly relativistic limit, the equation of state takes the form {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|4|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This yields a polytrope of index 3, which has a total mass, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}} say, depending only on {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="chandra4"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1931 | title =  The Maximum Mass of Ideal White Dwarfs| doi = 10.1086/143324 | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 81–82 | bibcode=1931ApJ....74...81C | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a fully relativistic treatment, the equation of state used interpolates between the equations {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|5|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} for small {{mvar|ρ}} and {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|4|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} for large {{mvar|ρ}}. When this is done, the model radius still decreases with mass, but becomes zero at {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is the Chandrasekhar limit.&lt;ref name="chandra2"/&gt;  The curves of radius against mass for the non-relativistic and relativistic models are shown in the graph. They are colored blue and green, respectively. {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii&lt;ref name="stds"&gt;[http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/catstd-3.2.htx ''Standards for Astronomical Catalogues, Version 2.0''], section 3.2.2, web page, accessed 12-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or kilometers, and mass in standard solar masses.

Calculated values for the limit vary depending on the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]] composition of the mass.&lt;ref name="timmes"/&gt;  Chandrasekhar&lt;ref name="chandra1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S. | year = 1931 | title = The Highly Collapsed Configurations of a Stellar Mass | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 456–466 | bibcode=1931MNRAS..91..456C | doi=10.1093/mnras/91.5.456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, eq.

(43)&lt;/sup&gt; gives the following expression, based on the [[equation of state]] for an ideal [[Fermi gas]]:
:&lt;math&gt; M_{\rm limit} = \frac{\omega_3^0 \sqrt{3\pi}}{2}\left ( \frac{\hbar c}{G}\right )^\frac32\frac{1}{(\mu_\text{e} m_\text{H})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

*{{mvar|ħ}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]]
*{{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]]
*{{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]]
*{{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the average [[molecular weight]] per electron, which depends upon the chemical composition of the star.
*{{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the mass of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]].
*{{math|''ω''{{su|b=3|p=0}} ≈ 2.018236}} is a constant connected with the solution to the [[Lane–Emden equation]].
As {{math|{{sqrt|''ħc''/''G''}}}} is the [[Planck mass]], the limit is of the order of
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_\text{Pl}^3}{m_\text{H}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

A more accurate value of the limit than that given by this simple model requires adjusting for various factors, including electrostatic interactions between the electrons and nuclei and effects caused by nonzero temperature.&lt;ref name="timmes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timmes | first1 = F.

==History==
In 1926, the British [[physicist]] [[Ralph H. Fowler]] observed that the relationship between the density, energy, and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fowler | first1 = R.

A series of papers published between 1931 and 1935 had its beginning on a trip from India to England in 1930, where the Indian physicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] worked on the calculation of the statistics of a degenerate Fermi gas.&lt;ref name="nasbio"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/schandrasekhar.html Chandrasekhar's biographical memoir at the National Academy of Sciences], web page, accessed 12-01-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In these papers, Chandrasekhar solved the [[hydrostatic equation]] together with the nonrelativistic Fermi gas [[equation of state]],&lt;ref name="chandra3"/&gt; and also treated the case of a relativistic Fermi gas, giving rise to the value of the limit shown above.&lt;ref name="chandra4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chandra2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chandra1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S. | year = 1934 | title = Stellar Configurations with degenerate Cores | journal = The Observatory | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 373–377 | bibcode=1934Obs....57..373C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chandrasekhar reviews this work in his Nobel Prize lecture.&lt;ref name="chandranobel"/&gt;  This value was also computed in 1932 by the Soviet physicist [[Lev Davidovich Landau]],&lt;ref&gt;On the Theory of Stars, in ''Collected Papers of L.

'''1''' (1932), 285.&lt;/ref&gt; who, however, did not apply it to white dwarfs.

Chandrasekhar's work on the limit aroused controversy, owing to the opposition of the British [[astrophysicist]] [[Arthur Eddington]]. Eddington was aware that the existence of [[black hole]]s was theoretically possible, and also realized that the existence of the limit made their formation possible. However, he was unwilling to accept that this could happen. After a talk by Chandrasekhar on the limit in 1935, he replied:

{{quote|The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets down to a few km radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold in the radiation, and the star can at last find peace. … I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1935 | title = Meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Friday, 1935 January 11 | journal = The Observatory | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 33–41 | bibcode=1935Obs....58...33.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eddington's proposed solution to the perceived problem was to modify relativistic mechanics so as to make the law {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|5|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} universally applicable, even for large {{mvar|ρ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eddington | first1 = A.

Miller]]'s biography of Chandrasekhar.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;  In Miller's view:

{{quote|Chandra's discovery might well have transformed and accelerated developments in both physics and astrophysics in the 1930s. Instead, Eddington's heavy-handed intervention lent weighty support to the conservative community astrophysicists, who steadfastly refused even to consider the idea that stars might collapse to nothing. As a result, Chandra's work was almost forgotten.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;{{rp|150}}}}

==Applications==
The core of a star is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of lighter [[chemical element|elements]] into heavier ones. At various stages of [[stellar evolution]], the nuclei required for this process are exhausted, and the core collapses, causing it to become denser and hotter. A critical situation arises when [[iron]] accumulates in the core, since iron nuclei are incapable of generating further energy through fusion. If the core becomes sufficiently dense, electron degeneracy pressure will play a significant part in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.&lt;ref name="evo2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woosley | first1 = S.

If a main-sequence star is not too massive (less than approximately 8 [[solar mass]]es), it eventually sheds enough mass to form a white dwarf having mass below the Chandrasekhar limit, which consists of the former core of the star. For more-massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure does not keep the iron core from collapsing to very great density, leading to formation of a [[neutron star]], [[black hole]], or, speculatively, a [[quark star]].  (For very massive, low-[[metallicity]] stars, it is also possible that instabilities destroy the star completely.)&lt;ref name="ifmr1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koester | first1 = D. | last2 = Reimers | first2 = D. | year = 1996 | title = White dwarfs in open clusters.

[[Type Ia supernova]]e derive their energy from runaway fusion of the nuclei in the interior of a [[white dwarf]]. This fate may befall [[carbon]]–[[oxygen]] white dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion [[giant star]], leading to a steadily increasing mass. As the white dwarf's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, its central density increases, and, as a result of [[compression (physical)|compression]]al heating, its temperature also increases. This eventually ignites [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, leading to an immediate [[carbon detonation]], which disrupts the star and causes the supernova.&lt;ref name="sniamodels"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillebrandt | first1 = Wolfgang | last2 = Niemeyer | first2 = Jens C. | year = 2000 | title = Type IA Supernova Explosion Models | journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 191–230 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.191 | bibcode=2000ARA&amp;A..38..191H|arxiv = astro-ph/0006305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, §5.1.2&lt;/sup&gt;

A strong indication of the reliability of Chandrasekhar's formula is that the [[absolute magnitude]]s of supernovae of Type Ia are all approximately the same; at maximum luminosity, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} is approximately −19.3, with a [[standard deviation]] of no more than 0.3.&lt;ref name="sniamodels"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, (1)&lt;/sup&gt;  A [[Confidence interval|1-sigma interval]] therefore represents a factor of less than 2 in luminosity. This seems to indicate that all type Ia supernovae convert approximately the same amount of mass to energy.

==Super-Chandrasekhar mass supernovae==
{{main|SN 2003fg|l1=Champagne Supernova}}
In April 2003, the [[Supernova Legacy Survey]] observed a type Ia supernova, designated [[SNLS-03D3bb]], in a galaxy approximately 4&amp;nbsp;billion [[light year]]s away. According to a group of astronomers at the [[University of Toronto]] and elsewhere, the observations of this supernova are best explained by assuming that it arose from a white dwarf that grew to twice the mass of the [[Sun]] before exploding. They believe that the star, dubbed the "[[SN 2003fg|Champagne Supernova]]" by University of Oklahoma astronomer David R. Branch, may have been spinning so fast that a centrifugal tendency allowed it to exceed the limit. Alternatively, the supernova may have resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs, so that the limit was only violated momentarily. Nevertheless, they point out that this observation poses a challenge to the use of type Ia supernovae as [[standard candles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-09/dbnl-twt092006.php The weirdest Type Ia supernova yet], LBL press release, web page accessed 13-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Champagne_Supernova_Challenges_Ideas_about_How_Supernovae_Work_999.html Champagne Supernova Challenges Ideas about How Supernovae Work], web page, spacedaily.com, accessed 13-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv = astro-ph/0609616 | doi=10.1038/nature05103 | volume=443 | title=The type Ia supernova SNLS-03D3bb from a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf star | year=2006 | journal=Nature | pages=308–311 | last1 = Howell | first1 = D. Andrew|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..308H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the observation of the Champagne Supernova in 2003, more very bright type Ia [[supernova]]e have been observed that are thought to have originated from [[white dwarf]]s whose masses exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit. These include [[SN 2006gz]], [[SN 2007if]] and [[SN 2009dc]].&lt;ref name="Machisu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hachisu|first=Izumi|author2=Kato, M.|title=A single degenerate progenitor model for type Ia supernovae highly exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass limit|bibcode=2012ApJ...744...69H|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/744/1/69|arxiv=1106.3510|volume=744|issue=1|year=2012|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|pages=76–79 (Article ID 69)|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs that gave rise to these supernovae are believed to have had masses up to 2.4–2.8 [[solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name="Machisu" /&gt; One way to potentially explain the problem of the Champagne Supernova was considering it the result of an aspherical explosion of a white dwarf. However, spectropolarimetric observations of [[SN 2009dc]] showed it had a [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] smaller than 0.3, making the large asphericity theory unlikely.&lt;ref name="Machisu" /&gt;

==Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit==

After a supernova explosion, a [[neutron star]] may be left behind. These objects are even more compact than white dwarfs and are also supported, in part, by degeneracy pressure. A neutron star, however, is so massive and compressed that electrons and protons have combined to form neutrons, and the star is thus supported by neutron degeneracy pressure (as well as short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions mediated by the [[strong force]]) instead of electron degeneracy pressure.  The limiting value for neutron star mass, analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit, is known as the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">The '''CHondritic Uniform Reservoir''' or '''CHUR''' is a scientific model in [[astrophysics]] and [[geochemistry]] for the mean chemical composition of the part of the [[Solar Nebula]] from which, during the formation of the Solar System, [[chondrite]]s formed. This hypothetical chemical reservoir is thought to have been similar in composition to the current [[photosphere]] of the [[Sun]].

When the Sun formed from its [[protostar]], around 4.56 billion years ago, the [[solar wind]] blew all [[gas]] [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]]s from the central part of the Solar Nebula. In this way most lighter [[volatiles]] (e.g. [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]] dioxide), that had not yet condensed in the inner, warmer regions of the nebula, were lost. This fractionation process is the reason why the [[terrestrial planet]]s and [[asteroid belt]] are relatively enriched in heavy elements in respect to the Sun or the [[gas planet]]s.

A certain type of meteorites, [[carbonaceous chondrite|CI-chondrites]], have a chemical composition that is almost identical to the solar [[photosphere]], except for the abundances of volatiles. Because the Sun contains 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System, they are considered to have the same composition as the solar nebula with the exception of volatile loss and are therefore representative of the material from which the terrestrial planets, including the Earth, were formed.

'''''Chronopolis''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by British writer [[J.G. Ballard]], first published in [[1960 in literature|1960]]. The story begins with a man in prison, Newman, and proceeds to examine his fascination with the concept of [[time]] in a world where clocks have been prohibited and are regulated by time [[police state|police]].

"Chronopolis" appears in an anthology edited by [[Andrew Goodwyn]], ''Science Fiction Stories''.&lt;ref name="Science Fiction Stories"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Science-Fiction-Stories-Literature-Resources/dp/019831261X |title=Andrew Goodwyn - Science Fiction Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the discipline|the journal|Communication Theory (journal)}}
'''Communication theory''' is a field of [[information theory]] and [[mathematics]] that studies the technical process of information&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |last=Shannon |first=Claude Elwood |date=2011 |origyear=July and October 1948 |publisher=The Bell System Technical Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=55 |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process of [[human communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life |last=Dainton |first=Marianne |authorlink= |author2=Elain D. Zellei |year=2011 |publisher= Sage Publications |location= |isbn=1-4129-7691-X |page= |pages=247 |url= http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4983_Dainton_Chapter_1.pdf |accessdate= November 4, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally communication theory is “any systematic summary about the nature of the communication process” (Dainton, 2019). It “is a coherent field of metadiscursive practice, a field of discourse about discourse with implications for the practice of communication” (Craig, 1999, pg. 120) and seeks to “provide conceptual resources for reflecting on communication problems” (p. 130).

== History ==
{{Main|A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Jakobson's functions of language|Outline of communication|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

=== Origins ===
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; [[Claude Shannon]] (1916–2001)

The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of [[information theory]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.

[[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.

[[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information,'' uses the word "information" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.

[[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948 under the title "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in [[probability theory]], developed by [[Norbert Wiener]]. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]] ("[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] with his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

=== Models of communication ===
{{Main|Models of communication}}

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, [[Warren Weaver]] and others, prompted research on new [[Conceptual model|models]] of communication from other scientific perspectives like [[psychology]] and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from disciplines different from [[mathematics]] and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':

{{Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|[[Daniel Chandler|D. Chandler]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, ''Communication Theory as a Field'' (1999), communication theory “consist of seven traditions that are […] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.”

"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.” (Craig, 1999, p. 143)

== Elements of communication ==

Basic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communication process |publisher=Center for Literacy Studies of the University of Tennessee |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cls.utk.edu/pdf/ls/Week1_Lesson7.pdf |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Communication source|Source]]''': Shannon calls this element the "information source", which "produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Sender''': Shannon calls this element the "transmitter", which "operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; In Aristotle, this element is the "speaker" (orator).&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |author1=Richard Whately |author2=Douglas Ehninger |author3=David Potter |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&amp;sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel''': For Shannon, the channel is "merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Receiver''': For Shannon, the receiver "performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Destination''': For Shannon, the destination is "the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Message''': from [[Latin]] ''mittere'', "to send". The message is a [[concept]], information, communication, or [[:wikt:statement|statement]] that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* '''Feedback'''
* '''Entropic elements, positive and negative'''

'''Construction management''' ('''CM''') is a professional service that uses specialized, project management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a project's time, cost and quality—sometimes referred to as a project's "triple constraint."&lt;ref&gt;3rd Forum "International Construction Project Management" 26th/27 June 2003 in Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; CM is compatible with all [[Project delivery method|project delivery systems]], including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings ([[Commercial property|commercial real estate]], [[Transport#Infrastructure|transportation infrastructure]], industrial facilities, and [[Infrastructure#Military|military infrastructure]]), called capital projects.

==The role of a contractor==
Contractors are assigned to a [[construction]] project during the design or once the design has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer. This is done by going through a [[bidding]] process with different contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of three common selection methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based selection.

A construction manager should have the ability to handle [[public safety]], [[time management]], [[cost management]], [[quality management]], [[decision making]], [[mathematics]], [[working drawings]], and [[human resources]].&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;

== Function ==
The functions of construction management typically include the following: 
#Specifying project objectives and plans including delineation of scope, budgeting, scheduling, setting performance requirements, and selecting project participants.
#Maximizing the resource efficiency through [[procurement]] of labor, materials and equipment.
#Implementing various operations through proper coordination and control of planning, design, estimating, contracting and construction in the entire process.
#Developing effective [[Construction Communication|communications]] and mechanisms for resolving conflicts.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=What Is Construction Project Management? | url=http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | author=Gerardo Viera | publisher=PM Hut | date=September 2008 | accessdate=2010-07-04 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420205521/http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | archivedate=2010-04-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Construction Management Association of America (CMAA)|Construction Management Association of America]] (CMAA) states the most common responsibilities of a Construction Manager fall into the following 7 categories: Project Management Planning, Cost Management, Time Management, Quality Management, Contract Administration, Safety Management, and CM Professional Practice. CM professional practice includes specific activities, such as defining the responsibilities and management structure of the project management team, organizing and leading by implementing project controls, defining roles and responsibilities, developing communication protocols, and identifying elements of project design and construction likely to give rise to disputes and claims.&lt;ref name="CMAA"&gt;{{cite web | title=CMAA | website=CMAA | url=http://cmaanet.org/ | language=af | accessdate=2015-07-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150724183335/http://cmaanet.org/ | archivedate=2015-07-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seven types of construction==
*'''Agricultural:''' Typically economical buildings, and other improvements, for agricultural purposes. Examples include barns, equipment and animal sheds, specialized fencing, storage [[silo]]s and [[elevator]]s, and water supply and drains such as wells, tanks, and ditches.
*'''Residential:''' Residential construction includes houses, apartments, townhouses, and other smaller, low-rise housing, small office types.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; 
*'''Commercial:''' This refers to construction for the needs of private commerce, trade, and services. Examples include office buildings, "big box" stores, shopping centers and malls, warehouses, banks, theaters, casinos, resorts, golf courses, and larger residential structures such as high-rise hotels and condominiums.
*'''Institutional:''' This category is for the needs of government and other public organizations. Examples include schools, fire and police stations, libraries, museums, dormitories, research buildings, hospitals, transportation terminals, some military facilities, and governmental buildings.
*'''Industrial:''' Buildings and other constructed items used for storage and product production, including chemical and power plants, steel mills, oil refineries and platforms, manufacturing plants, pipelines, and seaports.
*'''Heavy civil:''' The construction of transportation [[infrastructure]] such as roads, bridges, railroads, tunnels, airports, and fortified military facilities.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; Dams are also included, but most other water-related infrastructure is considered environmental.
*'''Environmental:''' Environmental construction was part of heavy civil, but is now separate, dealing with projects that improve the environment. Some examples are water and wastewater treatment plants, sanitary and storm sewers, solid waste management, and air pollution control.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Obtaining the project==

===Bids===
A bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to complete their construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they should expect to pay the construction management company in order for them to complete the project.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Open bid''': An open bid is used for public projects. Any and all contractors are allowed to submit their bid due to public advertising.
*'''Closed bid''': A closed bid is used for private projects. A selection of contractors are sent an invitation for bid so only they can submit a bid for the specified project.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Selection methods===
*'''Low-bid selection''': This selection focuses on the price of a project. Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that is the lowest amount they are willing to do the job for. Then the owner usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete the job for them.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Best-value selection''': This selection focuses on both the price and qualifications of the contractors submitting bids. This means that the owner chooses the contractor with the best price and the best qualifications. The owner decides by using a request for proposal (RFP), which provides the owner with the contractor's exact form of scheduling and budgeting that the contractor expects to use for the project.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Qualifications-based selection''': This selection is used when the owner decides to choose the contractor only on the basis of their qualifications. The owner then uses a request for qualifications (RFQ), which provides the owner with the contractor's experience, management plans, project organization, and budget and schedule performance. The owner may also ask for safety records and individual credentials of their members.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Construction Management Jumpstart|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|author=Barbara J. Jackson|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is most often used when the contractor is hired early during the design process so that the contractor can provide input and cost estimates as the design develops.

===Payment contracts===
*'''Lump sum''': This is the most common type of contract. The construction manager and the owner agree on the overall cost of the construction project and the owner is responsible for paying that amount whether the construction project exceeds or falls below the agreed price of payment.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Cost plus fee''': This contract provides payment for the contractor including the total cost of the project as well as a fixed fee or percentage of the total cost. This contract is beneficial to the contractor since any additional costs will be paid for, even though they were unexpected for the owner.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Guaranteed maximum price''': This contract is the same as the cost-plus-fee contract although there is a set price that the overall cost and fee do not go above.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Unitprice''': This contract is used when the cost cannot be determined ahead of time. The owner provides materials with a specific unit price to limit spending.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Project stages==
[[File:Buildings-05-00209-g001.png|thumb|right|Characteristics of construction project stages of various project management approaches&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;]]
The stages of a typical construction project have been defined as '''feasibility''', '''design''', '''construction''' and '''operation''',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antunes |first1=Ricardo |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Vicente |title=A Production Model for Construction:  A Theoretical Framework |journal=Buildings |date=3 March 2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=209–228 |doi=10.3390/buildings5010209}}&lt;/ref&gt; each stage relating to the project life cycle.
===Feasibility and design===
Feasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility, schematic design, design development, and contract documents. It is the responsibility of the design team to ensure that the design meets all building codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding process takes place.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Conceptual/Programming and feasibility:''' The needs, goals, and objectives must be determined for the building. Decisions must be made on the building size, number of rooms, how the space will be used, and who will be using the space. This must all be considered to begin the actual designing of the building. This phase is normally a written list of each room or space, the critical information about those spaces, and the approximate square footage of each area.
*'''Schematic design:''' Schematic designs are sketches used to identify spaces, shapes, and patterns. Materials, sizes, colors, and textures must be considered in the sketches.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; This phase usually involves developing the floor plan, elevations, a site plan, and possibly a few details.
*'''Design development (DD):''' This step requires research and investigation into what materials and equipment will be used as well as their cost. During this phase, the drawings are refined with information from structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineers. It also involves a more rigorous evaluation how the applicable building codes will impact the project.
*'''Contract documents (CDs):''' Contract documents are the final drawings and specifications of the construction project. They are used by contractors to determine their bid while builders use them for the construction process. Contract documents can also be called working drawings.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Pre-construction===
The pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to the contractor that they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to proceed is when the owner gives permission to the contractor to begin their work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team which includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendent]], and field engineer.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Project manager''': The project manager is in charge of the project team.
*'''Contract administrator''': The contract administrator assists the project manager as well as the superintendent with the details of the construction contract.
*'''Superintendent''': It is the superintendent's job to make sure everything is on schedule including flow of materials, deliveries, and equipment. They are also in charge of coordinating on-site construction activities.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Field engineer''': A field engineer is considered an entry-level position and is responsible for paperwork.
During the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site investigation takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on the job site. This is in order to get the site ready before the actual construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions such as historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to determine if the soil is in good condition to be built upon.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Procurement===
The procurement stage is when labor, materials and equipment needed to complete the project are purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the company does all their own construction work. If the contractor does not do their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors. Subcontractors are contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work such as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the same way a general contractor would be, which is through the bidding process. Purchase orders are also part of the procurement stage.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;
*'''Purchase orders:''' A purchase order is used in various types of businesses. In this case, a purchase order is an agreement between a buyer and seller that the products purchased meet the required specifications for the agreed price.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Construction===
The construction stage begins with a pre-construction meeting brought together by the superintendent (on an American project). The pre-construction meeting is meant to make decisions dealing with work hours, material storage, quality control, and site access. The next step is to move everything onto the construction site and set it all up.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

A '''Contractor progress payment schedule''' is a schedule of when (according to project milestones or specified dates) contractors and suppliers will be paid for the current progress of installed work.

'''Progress payments''' are partial payments for work completed during a portion, usually a month, during a construction period. Progress payments are made to general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects progress. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis but could be modified to meet certain milestones. Progress payments are an important part of contract administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete the project.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minks|first=William|title=Construction Jobsite Management|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owner occupancy===
Once the owner moves into the building, a warranty period begins. This is to ensure that all materials, equipment, and quality meet the expectations of the owner that are included within the contract.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Issues resulting from construction==

===Dust and mud===
When construction vehicles are driving around a site or moving earth, a lot of dust is created, especially during the dryer months. This may cause disruption for surrounding businesses or homes. A popular method of dust control is to have a water truck driving through the site spraying water on the dry dirt to minimize the movement of dust within and out of the construction site. When water is introduced mud is created. This mud sticks to the tires of the construction vehicles and is often lead out to the surrounding roads.  A street sweeper may clean the roads to reduce dirty road conditions.

===Environmental protections===
*'''Storm [[water pollution]]:''' As a result of construction, the soil is displaced from its original location which can possibly cause environmental problems in the future. Runoff can occur during storms which can possibly transfer harmful pollutants through the soil to rivers, lakes, wetlands, and coastal waters. 
*'''Endangered species:''' If [[endangered]] species have been found on the construction site, the site must be shut down for some time. The construction site must be shut down for as long as it takes for authorities to make a decision on the situation. Once the situation has been assessed, the contractor makes the appropriate accommodations to not disturb the species.
*'''Vegetation:''' There may often be particular trees or other vegetation that must be protected on the job site. This may require fences or security tape to warn builders that they must not be harmed.
*'''Wetlands:''' The contractor must make accommodations so that erosion and water flow are not affected by construction. Any liquid spills must be maintained due to contaminants that may enter the wetland.
*'''Historical or [[cultural artifacts]]:''' Artifacts may include arrowheads, pottery shards, and bones. All work comes to a halt if any artifacts are found and will not resume until they can be properly examined and removed from the area.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Construction activity documentation==
Project meetings take place at scheduled intervals to discuss the progress on the construction site and any concerns or issues. The discussion and any decisions made at the meeting must be documented.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

Diaries, logs, and daily field reports keep track of the daily activities on a job site each day.
*'''Diaries:''' Each member of the project team is expected to keep a project [[diary]]. The diary contains summaries of the day's events in the member's own words. They are used to keep track of any daily work activity, conversations, observations, or any other relevant information regarding the construction activities. Diaries can be referred to when disputes arise and a diary happens to contain information connected with the disagreement. Diaries that are handwritten can be used as evidence in court.
*'''Logs:''' Logs keep track of the regular activities on the job site such as phone logs, transmittal logs, delivery logs, and RFI (Request for Information) logs.
*'''Daily field reports:''' Daily field reports are a more formal way of recording information on the job site. They contain information that includes the day's activities, temperature and weather conditions, delivered equipment or materials, visitors on the site, and equipment used that day.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

Labor statements are required on a daily basis. Also list of Labor, PERT CPM are needed for labor planning to complete a project in time.

==Resolving disputes==
*'''Mediation:''' [[Mediation]] uses a third party mediator to resolve any disputes. The mediator helps both disputing parties to come to a mutual agreement. This process ensures that no attorneys become involved in the dispute and is less time-consuming.
*'''Minitrial:''' A minitrial takes more time and money than a mediation. The minitrial takes place in an informal setting and involves some type of advisor or attorney that must be paid. The disputing parties may come to an agreement or the third party advisor may offer their advice. The agreement is nonbinding and can be broken. 
*'''Arbitration:''' [[Arbitration]] is the most costly and time-consuming way to resolve a dispute. Each party is represented by an attorney while witnesses and evidence are presented. Once all information is provided on the issue, the arbitrator makes a ruling which provides the final decision. The arbitrator provides the final decision on what must be done and it is a binding agreement between each of the disputing parties.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

==Study and practice==
Construction Management education comes in a variety of formats: formal degree programs (Two-year [[associate degree]]; four-year [[baccalaureate degree]], [[masters degree]], [[project management]], [[operations management]] [[engineer degree]], [[doctor of philosophy]] degree, [[postdoctoral researcher]]); on-the-job-training; and continuing education and professional development. Information on degree programs is available from [[ABET]], the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE), the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) or the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC).
 
According to the American Council for Construction Education (one of the academic accreditation agencies responsible for accrediting construction management programs in the U.S.), the academic field of construction management encompasses a wide range of topics. These range from general management skills, through management skills specifically related to construction, to technical knowledge of construction methods and practices. There are many schools offering Construction Management programs, including some offering a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922010056/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php |date=2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326180259/http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-03-26|title=Standards and criteria for accreditation of post-secondary construction education degree programs|publisher=American Council for Construction Management|accessdate=2006-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Capital project management software (CPMS) refers to the systems that are currently available that help capital project owner/operators, program managers, and construction managers, control and manage the vast amount of information that capital construction projects create. A collection, or portfolio of projects only makes this a bigger challenge. These systems go by different names: capital project management software, computer construction software, construction management software, project management information systems. Usually Construction Management can be referred as subset of CPMS where the scope of CPMS is not limited to construction phases of project. Among main construction management software can be mentioned [[Procore]] and [[PlanGrid]].

==Business model==
[[File:Panamá Construction.JPG|thumb|alt=Two tall buildings, with construction cranes on top, next to much taller skyscraper|[[Skyscraper]]s under construction in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]]]
The construction industry typically includes three parties: an owner, a licensed designer ([[architect]] or [[engineer]]) and a builder (usually known as a [[general contractor]]). There are traditionally two contracts between these parties as they work together to plan, design and construct the project.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, Daniel. Construction Management. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract is the owner-designer contract, which involves planning, design, and construction contract administration. The second contract is the owner-contractor contract, which involves construction. An indirect third-party relationship exists between the designer and the contractor, due to these two contracts.

An owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an adviser, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer, design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as necessary.

===Design, bid, build contracts===
{{Main|Design–bid–build}}
The phrase "design, bid, build" describes the prevailing model of construction management, in which the general contractor is engaged through a tender process after designs have been completed by the architect or engineer.

==={{anchor|Design and build contracts}}Design-build contracts===
{{Main|Design–build}}
Many owners – particularly government agencies – let out contracts known as ''design-build contracts''. In this type of contract, the construction team (known as the design-builder) is responsible for taking the owner's concept and completing a detailed design before (following the owner's approval of the design) proceeding with construction. [[Virtual design and construction]] technology may be used by contractors to maintain a tight construction time.

There are three main advantages to a design-build contract. First, the construction team is motivated to work with the architect to develop a practical design. The team can find creative ways to reduce construction costs without reducing the function of the final product. The second major advantage involves the schedule. Many projects are commissioned within a tight time frame. Under a traditional contract, construction cannot begin until after the design is finished and the project has been awarded to a bidder. In a design-build contract the contractor is established at the outset, and construction activities can proceed concurrently with the design. The third major advantage is that the design-build contractor has an incentive to keep the combined design and construction costs within the owner's budget. If speed is important, design and construction contracts can be awarded separately; bidding takes place on preliminary plans in a not-to-exceed contract instead of a single firm design-build contract.

The major problem&lt;ref name=designbuild&gt;{{cite web|last=Stagner|first=Steve|title=Design-Build and Alternative Project Delivery in Texas|url=http://www.cectexas.org/research_&amp;_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|publisher=Texas Council of Engineering Companies|accessdate=18 October 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912011002/http://www.cectexas.org/research_%26_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with design-build contracts is an inherent conflict of interest. In a standard contract the architect works for the owner and is directly responsible to the owner. In design-build the architect works for the design-builder, not the owner, therefor the design-builder may make design and construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit the owner. During construction, the architect normally acts as the owner's representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for the owner directly. Thus, the owner may get a building that is over-designed to increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-quality products to maximize profits.

===Planning and scheduling===
Project-management methodology is as follows:
*Work breakdown structure
*Project network of activities
**[[Critical path method]] (CPM)
**Resource management
**Resource leveling
**Risk assessment

==={{anchor|Architecture–Engineer}}Architecture–engineer===
*Work inspection
*Change orders
*Review payments
*Materials and samples
*Shop drawings
*Three-dimensional image

===Agency CM===
Construction cost management is a fee-based service in which the construction manager (CM) is responsible exclusively to the owner, acting in the owner's interests at every stage of the project. The construction manager offers impartial advice on matters such as:
*Optimum use of available funds
*Control of the scope of the work
*Project scheduling
*Optimum use of design and construction firms' skills and talents
*Avoidance of delays, changes and disputes
*Enhancing project design and construction quality
*Optimum flexibility in contracting and procurement
*Cash-flow management

Comprehensive management of every stage of the project, beginning with the original concept and project definition, yields the greatest benefit to owners. As time progresses beyond the pre-design phase, the CM's ability to effect cost savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing [[scope creep]]), helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering, cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application field of [[construction collaboration technology]] has been developed to apply information technology to construction management.

===CM at-risk===
CM at-risk is a delivery method which entails a commitment by the construction manager to deliver the project within a [[Guaranteed Maximum Price]] (GMP). The construction manager acts as a consultant to the owner in the development and design phases (preconstruction services), and as a general contractor during construction. When a construction manager is bound to a GMP, the fundamental character of the relationship is changed. In addition to acting in the owner's interest, the construction manager must control construction costs to stay within the GMP.

CM at-risk is a global term referring to the business relationship of a construction contractor, owner and architect (or designer). Typically, a CM at-risk arrangement eliminates a "low-bid" construction project. A GMP agreement is a typical part of the CM-and-owner agreement (comparable to a "low-bid" contract), but with adjustments in responsibility for the CM. The advantage of a CM at-risk arrangement is budget management. Before a project's design is completed (six to eighteen months of coordination between designer and owner), the CM is involved with estimating the cost of constructing a project based on the goals of the designer and owner (design concept) and the project's scope. In balancing the costs, schedule, quality and scope of the project, the design may be modified instead of redesigned; if the owner decides to expand the project, adjustments can be made before pricing. To manage the budget before design is complete and construction crews mobilized, the CM conducts site management and purchases major items to efficiently manage time and cost.&lt;ref name="The Risk in CM At-Risk"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strang |first=Warner |date=2002 |title=The Risk In CM "At-Risk" |url=https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |format=PDF |journal=CM eJournal |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=3–8 |access-date=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084545/https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advantages====
*CM is working "at risk", therefore have incentive to act in the owner's interest, as well as to efficiently manage construction costs, considering they would be liable for any amount in excess of the GMP
*Ability to handle changes in design or scope&lt;ref name="Sierra Companies 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Construction Delivery Methods | website=Sierra Companies | date=2013-01-14 | url=http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | accessdate=2015-07-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235725/http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | archivedate=2015-07-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drawbacks====
*If a cost overrun occurred, it could cost the CM a great deal of money
* The CM is allowed some mistake-related contingency, therefore there is a possibility that they will compensate by reducing the scope of the work to fit the GMP
* Since the GMP is settled before design begins, it is difficult for owners to know whether they received the best possible bid&lt;ref name="The Risk in CM At-Risk"/&gt;

====Bottom line====
An at-risk delivery method is best for large projects—both complete construction and renovation—that are not easy to define, have a possibility of changing in scope, or have strict schedule deadlines. Additionally, it is an efficient method in projects containing technical complexity, multi-trade coordination, or multiple phases.&lt;ref name="Sierra Companies 2013"/&gt;

===Accelerated construction techniques===
Starting with its Accelerated Bridge Program in the late 2000s, the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] began employing accelerated construction techniques, in which it signs contracts with incentives for early completion and penalties for late completion, and uses intense construction during longer periods of complete closure to shorten the overall project duration and reduce cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/12mayjune/03.cfm|title=Public Roads - The Fast 14 Project, May/June 2012 - FHWA-HRT-12-004|author=|date=|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001800/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/12mayjune/03.cfm|archivedate=2013-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colocasia esculenta dsc07801.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Taro]] corms for sale in a [[Réunion]] market]]

A '''corm''', '''bulbo-tuber''', or '''bulbotuber''' is a short, vertical, swollen underground [[plant stem]] that serves as a [[storage organ]] that some plants use to survive winter or other adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat ([[perennation]]).

The word ''cormous'' usually means plants that grow from corms, parallel to the terms ''tuberous'' and ''bulbous'' to describe plants growing from [[tuber]]s and [[bulb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pate, John |author2=Dixon, Kingsley |author3=Pate, J. S. | title = Tuberous, Cormous and Bulbous Plants | publisher = [[University of Western Australia Press]] | location = Perth | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-85564-201-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:CrocosmiaCormTunic5601s.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Crocosmia]]'' corm with the tunic partly stripped to show its origin at the nodes on the corm [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]]]]
[[File:CormAnatomy5686.jpg|thumb|''Crocosmia'' corm anatomy, showing tunic, [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of storage tissue, central medulla, and emergence of a new corm from a bud near the top.]]
[[File:Corm stolons5680.jpg|left|thumb|''Crocosmia'' corm with [[stolon]]s emerging through the tunic. The stolons originate at the axillary buds of the corm scales, and generally produce new corms at their tips]]
A corm consists of one or more [[Internode (botany)|internodes]] with at least one growing point, generally with protective leaves modified into skins or [[Tunica (biology)|tunics]]. The tunic of a corm forms from dead [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] sheaths—remnants of leaves produced in previous years. They act as a covering, protecting the corm from insects, digging animals, flooding, and water loss. The tunics of some species are thin, dry, and papery, at least in young plants, however, in some families, such as ''Iridaceae'', the tunic of a mature corm can be formidable protection. For example, some of the larger species of ''[[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonia]]'' accumulate thick, rot-resistant tunics over a period of years, producing a structure of tough, reticulated fibre. Other species, such as many in the genus ''[[Lapeirousia]]'', have tunics of hard, woody layers.&lt;ref name = "Dyer"&gt;Dyer, R. Allen, ''The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants''. {{ISBN|0-621-02854-1}}, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, a typical corm mostly consists of [[parenchyma]] cells, rich in starch, above a circular basal node from which roots grow.

Long-lived cormous plants vary in their long-term development. Some regularly replace their older corms with a stack of younger corms, increased more or less seasonally. By splitting such a stack before the older corm generations wither too badly, the horticulturist can exploit the individual corms for propagation. Other species seldom do anything of that kind; their corms simply grow larger in most seasons. Yet others split when multiple buds or [[stolon]]s on a large corm sprout independently, forming a tussock.

Corms can be dug up and used to propagate or redistribute the plant (see, for example, [[taro]]). Plants with corms generally can be propagated by cutting the corms into sections and replanting. Suitably treated, each section with at least one bud usually can generate a new corm.

=== Comparison to bulbs ===
Corms are sometimes confused with true [[bulb]]s; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, and thus erroneously called bulbs. Corms are stems that are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales that are modified leaves. As a result, a corm cut in half appears solid inside, but a true bulb cut in half reveals that it is made up of layers.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=urbanext.illinois.edu
|accessdate=2009-12-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Corms are structurally plant stems, with nodes and internodes with buds and produce [[adventitious]] roots. On the top of the corm, one or a few buds grow into shoots that produce normal leaves and flowers.
[[File:corm.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''[[Gladiolus]]'' corm, showing the formation of small cormels at the ends of short stolons]]

== Cormels ==
Corms can form many small cormlets called '''cormels''', from the basal areas of the new growing corms, especially when the main growing point is damaged. These propagate corm-forming plants. A number of species replace corms every year by growing a new corm. This process starts after the shoot develops fully expanded leaves. The new corm forms at the shoot base just above the old corm. As the new corm grows, short [[stolon]]s appear that end with the newly growing small cormels. As the plants grow and flower, they use up the old corm, which shrivels away. The new corm that replaces the old corm grows in size, especially after flowering ends.

The old corm produces the greatest number of cormels when close to the soil surface. Small cormels normally take one or two more years of growth before they are large enough to flower.

Cormels do have a reproductive function, but in the wild they also are important as a survival strategy. In most countries where [[Storage organ|geophytes]] are common, so are animals that feed on them, whether from above like pigs, or from below like bulb weevils, [[blesmol|mole rats]], or [[pocket gopher]]s. Such animals eat through protective tunics, but they generally miss several cormels that remain in the soil to replace the consumed plant. Plants such as ''[[Homeria]]'', ''Watsonia'' and ''Gladiolus'', genera that are vulnerable to such animals, are probably the ones that produce cormels in the greatest numbers and most widely distributed over the plant. ''Homeria'' species produce bunches of cormels on underground stem nodes, and ''[[Watsonia meriana]]'' for example actually produces cormels profusely from under
[[bract]]s on the [[inflorescence]]s.&lt;ref name= "Manning"&gt;{{cite book | last = Manning | first = John | title = Field Guide to Fynbos | publisher = [[Struik Publishers]] | location = Cape Town | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-77007-265-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roots ==
Many corms produce two different types of roots. Those growing from the bottom of the corm are normal fibrous roots, they are formed as the shoots grow, and are produced from the basal area at the bottom of the corm. The second type of roots are thicker layered roots that form as the new corms are growing, they are called [[contractile root]]s and they pull the corm deeper into the soil. In some species contractile roots are produced in response to fluctuating soil temperatures and light levels. In such species, once the corm is deep enough within the soil where the temperature is more uniform and there is no light, the contractile roots no longer grow and the corm is no longer pulled deeper into the soil. In some other species however, contractile roots seem to be a defence against digging animals and can bury the corm surprisingly deeply over the years. ''Wurmbea marginata''&lt;ref name= "Manning"/&gt; is one example of a small plant that can be challenging to dig unharmed out of a hard, clayey hillside.

'''Dump digging''' is the practice of locating and excavating old garbage dumps with the intent of discovering objects which have potential value as collectibles or antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dumps are a window into history |quote=Campbell and the others call themselves "dumpdiggers," shoveling for signs of the past – pottery, bottles, buttons, cutlery, moustache cups – wherever people once tossed garbage. |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These dumps are sometimes centuries old but often date to the late 19th century or early part of the 20th century. Among other things, the practice of dump digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting and glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

It is a form of [[historical digging]] which involves long hours working with a shovel, pick and other hand tools.  Finding evidence of potential antique bottle dumps or middens is done by searching areas where it is likely that older garbage was deposited.  Diggers generally look for clues of pre1920s junk piles in the woods or down embankments, places where old houses or businesses stand or once stood.  Hiking along waterways and swampy areas, particularly during droughts, can also produce important clues and lead to good discoveries.  

Additionally, many coastal cities are surrounded by landfills or “tips”, places where enormous quantities of trash were deposited in the past intended to create additional acres of viable real estate.  It can take many months of searching each of these locations for a decent dig to be surface.

==Background and controversies==
Dump digging for potentially valuable collectibles is at least as old as the Pharaohs. For practical reasons dump diggers often use a much less forensic style than academic archeologists or museum curators would on their projects. Not unlike the privies, cisterns and wells that other historical diggers explore and salvage in, dumps are typically fleeting sources. They are often located on properties which are in the process of being permanently altered by major development and other factors.

==Items found and locations==
[[File:1870 tobacco pipe, EastEndDumpDiggers.jpg|thumb|250px|A clay pipe discovered while excavating an old bottle dump (ca. 1870).]]
Dump digging can yield different items and artifacts in each location. A town dump can be somewhat different than a farm dump or a railroad dump but in each case there could be industrial age pottery, [[stoneware]], china, tobacco pipes, military relics like bayonets and gun barrels, musket balls, uniform buttons and other buttons, marbles and an assortment of other things.  A high percentage of these dump discoveries are routinely found in severe states of decay, damaged or broken altogether.  In many cases even the things which have stood the test of time remarkably well have little if any monetary value.  There are many exceptions to this general rule that keep dump diggers busy searching and occasionally they are surprised by what they unearth working their sites.          

Through the common process known as tipping, vast amounts of refuse generated by towns and cities were dumped into harbors, along marshy shorelines and other areas while forming viable real estate cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= B.|last= Miller |title=Fat of the Land: Garbage in New York: The Last Two Hundred Years |place=New York |publisher= Four Walls Eight Windows |year=2000|isbn= 1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavating in these areas is also a form of dump digging.  Elusive and often deep, small portions of these ashy [[landfill]] dumps are sometimes rediscovered during major development projects.  Enormous quantities of a given locations everyday trash were deposited into these often difficult to reach locales.  

The bulk of this garbage has never been investigated and at present much of it is still undiscovered.  Through researching and active searching occasionally the opportunity arises to dig into small portions and find old bottles and other objects which survive remarkably well as curiosities, collectibles or antiques. For centuries active waterways were also frequently converted into major dumping spots for household and industrial refuse but they are generally impossible to reach without expensive equipment.  Along with the existing information generated from the efforts of dump diggers and others, a wealth of additional information is waiting among these widely distributed landfills and other dumping spots.

The '''Economic and Social Research Council''' ('''ESRC''') is one of the seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It receives most of its funding from the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], and provides funding and support for research and training work in the [[social sciences]] and [[economics]], such as postgraduate degrees.

==Structure==
The ESRC is based at Polaris House in [[Swindon]], UK which is also the location of the head offices of several other UK Research Councils and [[Innovate UK]]. ESRC is part of [[United Kingdom Research and Innovation]] (UKRI)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukri.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;, an organisation that brings together the UK’s research councils, Innovate UK and [[Research England]]. UKRI is a [[non-departmental public body]] funded by a grant-in-aid from the [[UK government]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} &lt;ref name="ESRC what they do"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/what-we-do/|title = ESRC what they do|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ESRC's mission, according to its website, is to:&lt;ref name="mission, strategy and priorities"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/strategy-and-priorities/|title = ESRC mission, strategy and priorities|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* promote and support, by any means, high-quality research and related postgraduate training on social and economic issues
* develop and support the national data infrastructure that underpins high-quality research
* advance knowledge and provide trained social scientists who meet the needs of users and beneficiaries, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of the UK, the effectiveness of public services and policy, and the quality of life
* communicate clearly and promote public understanding of social science.

==History==
The ESRC was founded in 1965 as the ''Social Science Research Council'' (SSRC - not to be confused with the [[Social Science Research Council]] in the United States). The establishment of a state [[funding body]] for the social sciences in the United Kingdom, had been under discussion since the [[World War II|Second World War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ESRC's history|publisher = ESRC|date = December 2015|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the 1964 election of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] that the political climate for the creation of the SSRC became sufficiently favourable.

The first chief executive of the SSRC was [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (later Baron Young of Dartington). Subsequent holders of the post have included [[Michael Posner (economist)|Michael Posner]], later Secretary General of the [[European Science Foundation]]. The current Chief Executive of the ESRC is [https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/governance-and-structure/directors/jennifer-rubin/ Professor Jennifer Rubin] who took over from Professor [[Jane Elliott (academic)|Jane Elliott]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = King's Professor Jennifer Rubin appointed ESRC Chief Executive|publisher = KCL|url = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/news/newsrecords/2017/King's-Professor-Jennifer-Rubin-appointed-ESRC-Chief-Executive.aspx|accessdate = 2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Change of name===
Following the election of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 general election, the Government expressed reservations about the value of research in the social sciences, and the extent to which it should be publicly funded. In 1981, the Education Secretary [[Keith Joseph|Sir Keith Joseph]] asked [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] to lead a review into the future of the SSRC.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It was ultimately decided (due in no small part to the efforts of Michael Posner, chief executive of the SSRC at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michael Posner Obituary|publisher = The Independent|date = April 2009|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-posner-6107063.html|accessdate = 2015-12-03|location = London|first = Michael|last = Kuczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the Council should remain, but that its remit should be expanded beyond the social sciences, to include more 'empirical' research and research of 'more public concern'. To reflect this, in 1983 the SSRC was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SSRC/ESRC: the first forty years|publisher = ESRC|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/ssrc-and-esrc-the-first-forty-years/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Environmental law}}

'''Environmental law''', also known as environmental '''and natural resources''' law, is a collective term describing the network of [[Treaty|treaties]], [[statute]]s, [[regulation]]s, [[common law|common]] and [[custom (law)|customary]] laws addressing the effects of human activity on the [[natural environment]]. The core environmental law regimes address environmental [[pollution]]. A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes, now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles, focus on the management of specific [[natural resources]], such as forests, minerals, or fisheries. Other areas, such as environmental impact assessment, may not fit neatly into either category, but are nonetheless important components of environmental law.&lt;section end=scope /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of environmental law}}
Early examples of legal enactments designed to consciously preserve the environment, for its own sake or human enjoyment, are found throughout history. In the [[common law]], the primary protection was found in the law of [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]], but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from [[pig sty|pig sties]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aldred's Case]]'' (1610) 9 Co Rep 57b; (1610) 77 ER 816&lt;/ref&gt; [[strict liability]] against dumping rubbish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Stephens]]'' (1866) LR 1 QB 702&lt;/ref&gt; or damage from exploding dams.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' [1868] UKHL 1&lt;/ref&gt; Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. During the "[[Great Stink]]" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the [[River Thames]] began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. Ironically, the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848]] had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close [[cesspit]]s around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the [[London sewerage system]]. London also suffered from terrible [[air pollution]], and this culminated in the "[[Great Smog]]" of 1952, which in turn triggered its own legislative response: the [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning [[coal]]) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance.

Notwithstanding early analogues, the concept of "environmental law" as a separate and distinct body of law is a twentieth-century development.&lt;ref&gt;See generally R. Lazarus, [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3629140.html The Making of Environmental Law (Cambridge Press 2004)]; P. Gates, [http://www.arkansasresearch.com/HistReprints/GatesLandBook.htm History of Public Land Law Development].&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition that the natural environment was fragile and in need of special legal protections, the translation of that recognition into legal structures, the development of those structures into a larger body of "environmental law," and the strong influence of environmental law on natural resource laws, did not occur until about the 1960s. At that time, numerous influences - including a growing awareness of the unity and fragility of the [[biosphere]]; increased public concern over the impact of industrial activity on natural resources and human health; the increasing strength of the regulatory state; and more broadly the advent and success of [[environmental movement|environmentalism as a political movement]] - coalesced to produce a huge new body of law in a relatively short period of time. While the modern history of environmental law is one of continuing controversy, by the end of the twentieth century environmental law had been established as a component of the legal landscape in all [[Developed country|developed nations]] of the world, many [[Developing country|developing ones]], and the larger project of [[international law]].

===Chemical safety===
Chemical safety laws govern the use of [[chemicals]] in human activities, particularly man-made chemicals in modern industrial applications. As contrasted with media-oriented environmental laws (e.g., air or water quality laws), chemical control laws seek to manage the (potential) pollutants themselves. Regulatory efforts include banning specific chemical constituents in consumer products (e.g., [[Bisphenol A controversy|Bisphenol A]] in plastic bottles), and regulating [[pesticides]].

=== Wildlife and plants ===
Wildlife laws govern the potential impact of human activity on wild animals, whether directly on individuals or populations, or indirectly via habitat degradation. Similar laws may operate to protect plant species. Such laws may be enacted entirely to protect [[biodiversity]], or as a means for protecting species deemed important for other reasons. Regulatory efforts may including the creation of special [[conservation status]]es, prohibitions on killing, harming, or disturbing protected species, efforts to induce and support species recovery, establishment of wildlife refuges to support conservation, and prohibitions on trafficking in species or animal parts to combat [[poaching]].

=== Fish and game ===
{{Main article|Game law}}
{{Further|Fisheries law}}

Fish and game laws regulate the right to pursue and take or kill certain kinds of [[fish]] and [[wild animal]] ([[game (food)|game]]). Such laws may restrict the days to harvest fish or game, the number of animals caught per person, the species harvested, or the weapons or fishing gear used. Such laws may seek to balance dueling needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[Population biology|populations]] of fish and game. Game laws can provide a legal structure to collect [[license]] fees and other [[Federal Duck Stamp|money]] which is used to fund [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] efforts as well as to obtain harvest information used in [[wildlife management]] practice.

==Principles==
Environmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness of and concern over issues impacting the entire world. While laws have developed piecemeal and for a variety of reasons, some effort has gone into identifying key concepts and guiding principles common to environmental law as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has identified eleven "emerging principles and concepts" in international environmental law, derived from the [[Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|1972 Stockholm Conference]], the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|1992 Rio Declaration]], and more recent developments. UNEP, [http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf Training Manual on International Environmental Law] (Chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The principles discussed below are not an exhaustive list and are not universally recognized or accepted. Nonetheless, they represent important principles for the understanding of environmental law around the world.

=== Sustainable development ===
{{Main article|Sustainable development}}
Defined by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," [[sustainable development]] may be considered together with the concepts of "integration" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and "interdependence" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws mandating [[environmental impact assessment]] and requiring or encouraging development to minimize environmental impacts may be assessed against this principle.

The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN [[Earth Summit]] resulted in the [[Rio Declaration]], Principle 3 of which reads: "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations." Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Earth Summit 2002), and the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).

=== Equity ===
{{Further|Intergenerational equity}}
Defined by UNEP to include intergenerational equity - "the right of future generations to enjoy a fair level of the common patrimony" - and intragenerational equity - "the right of all people within the current generation to fair access to the current generation's entitlement to the Earth's natural resources" - environmental equity considers the present generation under an obligation to account for long-term impacts of activities, and to act to sustain the global environment and resource base for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution control and resource management laws may be assessed against this principle.

=== Transboundary responsibility ===
Defined in the international law context as an obligation to protect one's own environment, and to prevent damage to neighboring environments, UNEP considers transboundary responsibility at the international level as a potential limitation on the rights of the [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws that act to limit [[externalities]] imposed upon human health and the environment may be assessed against this principle.

=== Public participation and transparency ===
Identified as essential conditions for "accountable governments,...  industrial concerns," and organizations generally, public participation and transparency are presented by UNEP as requiring "effective protection of the human right to hold and express opinions and to seek, receive and impart ideas,... a right of access to appropriate, comprehensible and timely information held by governments and industrial concerns on economic and social policies regarding the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment, without imposing undue financial burdens upon the applicants and with adequate protection of privacy and business confidentiality," and "effective judicial and administrative proceedings." These principles are present in [[environmental impact assessment]], laws requiring publication and access to relevant environmental data, and [[administrative procedure]].

=== Precautionary principle ===
{{Main article|Precautionary principle}}
One of the most commonly encountered and controversial principles of environmental law, the [[Rio Declaration]] formulated the precautionary principle as follows:

:In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.

The principle may play a role in any debate over the need for environmental regulation.

=== Prevention ===
:The concept of prevention . . . can perhaps better be considered an overarching aim that gives rise to a multitude of legal mechanisms, including prior assessment of environmental harm, licensing or authorization that set out the conditions for operation and the consequences for violation of the conditions, as well as the adoption of strategies and policies. Emission limits and other product or process standards, the use of best available techniques and similar techniques can all be seen as applications of the concept of prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polluter pays principle ===
{{Main article|Polluter pays principle}}
The polluter pays principle stands for the idea that "the environmental costs of economic activities, including the cost of preventing potential harm, should be internalized rather than imposed upon society at large."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rio Declaration]] Principle 16; [http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual] ¶ 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  All issues related to responsibility for cost for [[environmental remediation]] and compliance with pollution control regulations involve this principle.

==Theory==
Environmental law is a continuing source of controversy. Debates over the necessity, fairness, and cost of environmental regulation are ongoing, as well as regarding the appropriateness of regulations vs. market solutions to achieve even agreed-upon ends.

Allegations of scientific uncertainty fuel the [[Global warming controversy|ongoing debate]] over greenhouse gas regulation, and are a major factor in debates over whether to ban particular pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[DDT]].&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where the science is well-settled, it is not unusual to find that corporations intentionally hide or distort the facts, or sow confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt|title=Merchants of Doubt|author=The Christian Science Monitor|date=22 June 2010|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common for regulated industry to argue against environmental regulation on the basis of cost.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, estimates of environmental regulation total costs reach 2% of [[GDP]]. See [http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-03-06.pdf Pizer &amp; Kopp, Calculating the Costs of Environmental Regulation, 1 (2003 Resources for the Future)].&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties arise in performing [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental issues.  It is [[Ecosystem valuation|difficult to quantify]] the value of an environmental value such as a healthy ecosystem, clean air, or species diversity. Many environmentalists' response to pitting economy vs. ecology is summed up by former Senator and founder of [[Earth Day]] [[Gaylord Nelson]], "The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Earth Day: Fulfilling the Promise|first=Gaylord|last=Nelson|date=November 2002|publisher=Wisconsin Press|url=http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/2095.htm|isbn=0-299-18040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, environmental issues are seen by many as having an [[Environmental ethics|ethical or moral]] dimension, which would transcend financial cost. Even so, there are some efforts underway to systemically recognize environmental costs and assets, and account for them properly in economic terms.

While affected industries spark controversy in fighting regulation, there are also many environmentalists and public interest groups who believe that current regulations are inadequate, and advocate for stronger protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-world-really-set-aside-half-planet-wildlife-180952379/|title=Can the World Really Set Aside Half of the Planet for Wildlife?|publisher=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/03/09/climate-coalition-vows-peaceful-escalated-actions-until-we-break-free-fossil-fuels|title=Climate Coalition Vows 'Peaceful, Escalated' Actions Until 'We Break Free from Fossil Fuels'|work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2006/03/guide-environmental-non-profits|title=A Guide to Environmental Non-Profits|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental law conferences - such as the annual [[University of Oregon School of Law#Public Interest Environmental Law Conference|Public Interest Environmental Law Conference]] in Eugene, Oregon - typically have this focus, also connecting environmental law with class, race, and other issues.

An additional debate is to what extent environmental laws are fair to all regulated parties. For instance, researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg highlight how smaller organizations can often incur disproportionately larger costs as a result of environmental regulations, which can ultimately create an additional barrier to entry for new firms, thus stifling competition and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development?

===International law===
{{Further|Environmental protocol}}
Global and regional environmental issues are increasingly the subject of [[international law]]. Debates over environmental concerns implicate core principles of international law and have been the subject of numerous international agreements and declarations.

[[Customary international law]] is an important source of international environmental law.  These are the norms and rules that countries follow as a matter of custom and they are so prevalent that they bind all states in the world.  When a principle becomes customary law is not clear cut and many arguments are put forward by states not wishing to be bound.  Examples of customary international law relevant to the environment include the duty to warn other states promptly about icons of an environmental nature and environmental damages to which another state or states may be exposed, and Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration ('good neighbourliness' or sic utere).

Numerous [[List of international environmental agreements|legally binding international agreements]] encompass a wide variety of issue-areas, from terrestrial, marine and atmospheric pollution through to wildlife and biodiversity protection. International environmental agreements are generally [[Multilateral treaty|multilateral]] (or sometimes [[Bilateral treaty|bilateral]]) [[Treaty|treaties]] (a.k.a. convention, agreement, protocol, etc.). [[Treaty#Protocols|Protocols]] are subsidiary agreements built from a primary treaty. They exist in many areas of international law but are especially useful in the environmental field, where they may be used to regularly incorporate recent scientific knowledge. They also permit countries to reach agreement on a framework that would be contentious if every detail were to be agreed upon in advance.  The most widely known protocol in international environmental law is the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which followed from the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].

While the bodies that proposed, argued, agreed upon and ultimately adopted existing international agreements vary according to each agreement, certain conferences, including 1972's [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], 1983's [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1992's [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] and 2002's [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] have been particularly important. [[Multilateral environmental agreement]]s sometimes create an International Organization, Institution or Body responsible for implementing the agreement. Major examples are the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES) and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

International environmental law also includes the opinions of international courts and tribunals. While there are few and they have limited authority, the decisions carry much weight with legal commentators and are quite influential on the development of international environmental law. One of the biggest challenges in international decisions is to determine an adequate compensation for environmental damages.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman Reis, T., ''Compensation for Environmental Damages Under International Law'', Kluwer Law International, The Hague, 2011, {{ISBN|978-90-411-3437-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts include the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the international Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the [[European Court of Justice]], [[European Court of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0C818E19-C40B-412E-9856-44126D49BDE6/0/FICHES_Environment_EN.pdf |title=ECtHR case-law factsheet on environment |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110114815/http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0C818E19-C40B-412E-9856-44126D49BDE6/0/FICHES_Environment_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other regional treaty tribunals.

=== Africa ===
According to the [[International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement]] (INECE), the major environmental issues in Africa are “drought and [[flood]]ing, air pollution, [[deforestation]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], freshwater availability, degradation of soil and vegetation, and widespread poverty.” &lt;ref name=INECE&gt;{{cite web |title=INECE Regions- Africa |url=http://www.inece.org/region_africa.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820012452/http://www.inece.org/region_africa.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is focused on the “growing urban and industrial pollution, water quality, [[electronic waste]] and indoor air from cookstoves.” &lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa International Programs|url=http://www.epa.gov/international/regions/Africa/|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hope to provide enough aid on concerns regarding pollution before their impacts contaminate the African environment as well as the global environment.  By doing so, they intend to “protect human health, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and the poor.” &lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;  In order to accomplish these goals in Africa, EPA programs are focused on strengthening the ability to enforce environmental laws as well as public compliance to them.  Other programs work on developing stronger environmental laws, regulations, and standards.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;

===Asia===
The Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network (AECEN) is an agreement between 16 Asian countries dedicated to improving cooperation with environmental laws in Asia. These countries include Cambodia, China, Indonesia, India, Maldives, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, and Lao PDR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AECEN|url = http://www.aecen.org/|website = www.aecen.org|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
The [[European Union]] issues secondary legislation on environmental issues that are valid throughout the EU (so called regulations) and many directives that must be implemented into national legislation from the 28 member states (national states). Examples are the Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 on the implementation of CITES; or the Natura 2000 network the centerpiece for nature &amp; biodiversity policy, encompassing the bird Directive (79/409/EEC/ changed to 2009/147/EC)and the habitats directive (92/43/EEC). Which are made up of multiple SACs (Special Areas of Conservation, linked to the habitats directive) &amp; SPAs (Special Protected Areas, linked to the bird directive), throughout Europe.

EU legislation is ruled in Article 249 Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Topics for common EU legislation are:

* Climate change
* Air pollution
* Water protection and management
* Waste management
* Soil protection
* Protection of nature, species and biodiversity
* Noise pollution
* Cooperation for the environment with third countries (other than EU member states)
* Civil protection

=== Middle East ===
The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] is working with countries in the [[Middle East]] to improve “environmental governance, water pollution and water security, clean fuels and vehicles, public participation, and pollution prevention.”&lt;ref name="Middle East"&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Middle East|url=http://www.epa.gov/oia/regions/Mideast/index.html|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
The main concerns on environmental issues in the Oceanic Region are “illegal releases of air and water [[pollutant]]s, [[illegal logging]]/timber trade, illegal shipment of [[hazardous waste]]s, including [[e-waste]] and ships slated for destruction, and insufficient institutional structure/lack of enforcement capacity”.&lt;ref name="INECE Asia"&gt;{{cite web |title=INECE Regions - Asia and the Pacific |url=http://www.inece.org/region_asia.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021217145241/http://inece.org/region_asia.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 17, 2002 |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sprep.org/ Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP)]&lt;/ref&gt;  is an international organization between Australia, the Cook Islands, FMS, Fiji, France, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Island, Tonga, Tuvalu, USA, and Vanuatu.

=== Australia ===
The [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]] is the center piece of environmental legislation in the Australian Government. It sets up the “legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places”.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;{{cite web|title=EPBC Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/index.html|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also focuses on protecting world heritage properties, national heritage properties, wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, migratory species, Commonwealth marine areas, [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]], and the environment surrounding nuclear activities.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; ''Commonwealth v Tasmania'' (1983), also known as the "Tasmanian Dam Case", is the most influential case for Australian environmental law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/21.html Commonwealth v Tasmania] (1983) 158 CLR 1 (1 July 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian government created the [[Ministry of the Environment (Brazil)|Ministry of Environment]] in 1992 in order to develop better strategies of protecting the environment, use natural resources sustainably, and enforce public environmental policies.  The Ministry of Environment has authority over policies involving environment, water resources, preservation, and environmental programs involving the Amazon.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite web|title=Apresentação|url=http://www.mma.gov.br/o-ministerio/apresentacao|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
The [[Department of the Environment Act]] establishes the [[Department of the Environment (Canada)|Department of the Environment]] in the Canadian government as well as the position [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]].  Their duties include “the preservation and enhancement of the quality of the natural environment, including water, air and soil quality; renewable resources, including migratory birds and other non-domestic flora and fauna; water; meteorology;"&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of the Environment Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-10/page-1.html|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999|Environmental Protection Act]] is the main piece of Canadian environmental legislation that was put into place March 31, 2000.

When provincial and federal legislation are in conflict federal legislation takes precedence, that being said individual provinces can have their own legislation such as Ontario's [[Environmental Bill of Rights]], and [[Clean Water Act (Ontario)|Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;See [https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=laws_canada_legal Canada's Legal System Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822000216/https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=laws_canada_legal |date=2017-08-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{See also|Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China}}
According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], "China has been working with great determination in recent years to develop, implement, and enforce a solid environmental law framework.

=== Ecuador ===
With the enactment of the [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the [[Rights of Nature]]. The Constitution, specifically Articles 10 and 71-74, recognizes the inalienable rights of [[ecosystem]]s to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights. The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property and legalize and manage degradation of the environment rather than prevent it.&lt;ref name="Celdf"&gt;Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime, led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "Buen Vivir," or good living—focused on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth—gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of "Buen Vivir" originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of "Buen Vivir." &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. ''[[Latin American Perspectives]]'' 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egypt ===
The [[Environmental Protection Law (Egypt)|Environmental Protection Law]] outlines the responsibilities of the Egyptian government to “preparation of draft legislation and decrees pertinent to environmental management, collection of data both nationally and internationally on the state of the environment, preparation of periodical reports and studies on the state of the environment, formulation of the national plan and its projects, preparation of environmental profiles for new and urban areas, and setting of standards to be used in planning for their development, and preparation of an annual report on the state of the environment to be prepared to the President."&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite web|title=Law 4|url=http://www.eeaa.gov.eg/English/main/law4.asp|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{main|Indian environmental law}}
In India, Environmental law is governed by the Environment Protection Act, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = THE ENVIRONMENT (PROTECTION) ACT, 1986|url = http://envfor.nic.in/legis/env/env1.html|website = envfor.nic.in|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act is enforced by the Central Pollution Control Board and the numerous State Pollution Control Boards. Apart from this, there are also individual legislations specifically enacted for the protection of Water, Air, Wildlife, etc. Such legislations include :- 
*The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
*The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977
*The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
*The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981

=== Japan ===
The [[Basic Environmental Law]] is the basic structure of Japan’s environmental policies replacing the [[Basic Law for Environmental Pollution Control]] and the [[Nature Conservation Law]]. The updated law aims to address “global environmental problems, urban pollution by everyday life, loss of accessible natural environment in urban areas and degrading environmental protection capacity in forests and farmlands.”&lt;ref name=Japan&gt;{{cite web|title=The Basic Environment Law|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/laws/policy/basic/leaflet2.html|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three basic environmental principles that the Basic Environmental Law follows are “the blessings of the environment should be enjoyed by the present generation and succeeded to the future generations, a sustainable society should be created where environmental loads by human activities are minimized, and Japan should contribute actively to global environmental conservation through international cooperation.”&lt;ref name="Japan"/&gt;
From these principles, the Japanese government have established policies such as “environmental consideration in policy formulation, establishment of the Basic Environment Plan which describes the directions of long-term environmental policy, environmental impact assessment for development projects, economic measures to encourage activities for reducing environmental load, improvement of social infrastructure such as sewerage system, transport facilities etc., promotion of environmental activities by corporations, citizens and NGOs, environmental education, and provision of information, promotion of science and technology."&lt;ref name="Japan"/&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main article|New Zealand environmental law}}

The [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]] and [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment|Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]] were established by the [[Environment Act 1986]]. These positions are responsible for advising the Minister on all areas of environmental legislation.  A common theme of New Zealand’s environmental legislation is sustainably managing natural and physical resources, fisheries, and forests.

'''Event tree analysis''' ('''ETA''') is a forward, bottom up, logical modeling technique for both success and failure that explores responses through a single initiating event and lays a path for assessing probabilities of the outcomes and overall system analysis.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clemens|first=P.L.|author2=Rodney J. Simmons|title=System Safety and Risk Management|journal=NIOSH Instructional Module, A guide for Engineering Educators|date=March 1998|pages=IX-3 - IX-7|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|location=Cincinnati,OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis technique is used to analyze the effects of functioning or failed systems given that an event has occurred.&lt;ref name="wang69"&gt;Wang, John '' et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|''What Every Engineer Should Know About Risk Engineering and Management,'' p. 69.|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA is a powerful tool that will identify all consequences of a system that have a probability of occurring after an initiating event that can be applied to a wide range of systems including: [[nuclear power plants]], [[spacecraft]], and chemical plants. This technique may be applied to a system early  in the design process to identify potential issues that may arise, rather than correcting the issues after they occur.&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; With this forward logic process, use of ETA as a tool in risk assessment can help to prevent negative outcomes from occurring, by providing a risk assessor with the probability of occurrence. ETA uses a type of modeling technique called [[event tree]], which branches events from one single event using [[Boolean logic]].

==History==

The name Event Tree was first introduced during the [[WASH-1400]] nuclear power plant safety study (circa 1974), where the [[WASH-1400]] team needed an alternate method to [[fault tree analysis]] due to the fault trees being too large. Though not using the name event tree, the UKAEA first introduced ETA in its design offices in 1968, initially to try to use whole plant risk assessment to optimize the design of a 500MW Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor. This study showed ETA condensed the analysis into a manageable form.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1"/&gt; ETA was not initially developed during WASH-1400, this was one of the first cases in which it was thoroughly used.  The UKAEA study used the assumption that protective systems either worked or failed, with the probability of failure per demand being calculated using fault trees or similar analysis methods.  ETA identifies all sequences which follow an initiating event.  Many of these sequences can be eliminated from the analysis because their frequency or effect are too small to affect the overall result.  A paper presented at a CREST symposium in Munich, Germany, in 1971&lt;ref name="wang69"/&gt; shows how this was done.  The conclusions of the US EPA study of the Draft WASH-1400&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; acknowledges the role of Ref 1 and its criticism of the Maximum Credible Accident approach used by AEC. MCA sets the reliability target for the containment but those for all other safety systems are set by smaller but more frequent accidents and would be missed by MCA.

In 2009 a risk analysis was conducted on underwater tunnel excavation under the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] in [[Korea]] using an earth pressure balance type [[tunnel boring machine]]. ETA was used to quantify risk, by providing the probability of occurrence of an event, in the preliminary design stages of the tunnel construction to prevent any injuries or fatalities because tunnel construction in Korea has the highest injury and fatality rates within the construction category.&lt;ref name="Eun-Soo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong|first=Eun-Soo |author2=In-Mo Lee |author3=Hee-Soon Shin |author4=Seok-Woo Nam |author5=Jung-Sik Kong|title=Quantitative risk evaluation based on event tree analysis technique: Application to the design of shield TBM|journal=Tunneling and Underground Space Technology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=269–277|doi=10.1016/j.tust.2008.09.004|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Performing a [[probabilistic risk assessment]] starts with a set of initiating events that change the state or configuration of the system.&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;  An initiating event is an event that starts a reaction, such as the way a spark (initiating event) can start a fire that could lead to other events (intermediate events) such as a tree burning down, and then finally an outcome, for example, the burnt tree no longer provides apples for food.  Each initiating event leads to another event and continuing through this path, where each intermediate event's probability of occurrence may be calculated by using fault tree analysis, until an end state is reached (the outcome of a tree no longer providing apples for food).&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;  Intermediate events are commonly split into a [[binary number|binary]] (success/failure or yes/no) but may be split into more than two as long as the events are [[mutually exclusive]], meaning that they can not occur at the same time. If a spark is the initiating event there is a probability that the spark will start a fire or will not start a fire (binary yes or no) as well as the probability that the fire spreads to a tree or does not spread to a tree.  End states are classified into groups that can be successes or severity of consequences. An example of a success would be that no fire started and the tree still provided apples for food while the severity of consequence would be that a fire did start and we lose apples as a source of food. Loss end states can be any state at the end of the pathway that is a negative outcome of the initiating event. The loss end state is highly dependent upon the system, for example if you were measuring a quality process in a factory a loss or end state would be that the product has to be reworked or thrown in the trash. Some common loss end states:&lt;ref name=Clifton&gt;{{cite book|last=Ericson|first=Clifton A.|title=Hazard Analysis Techniques for System Safety|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Damage to or loss of equipment or property (including software)&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

==Methodology==

The overall goal of event tree analysis is to determine the probability of possible negative outcomes that can cause harm and result from the chosen initiating event. It is necessary to use detailed information about a system to understand intermediate events, accident scenarios, and initiating events to construct the event tree diagram. The event tree begins with the initiating event where consequences of this event follow in a binary (success/failure) manner. Each event creates a path in which a series of successes or failures will occur where the overall probability of occurrence for that path can be calculated. The probabilities of failures for intermediate events can be calculated using [[fault tree analysis]] and the probability of success can be calculated from 1 = probability of success (ps) + probability of failure (pf).&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; For example, in the equation 1 = (ps) + (pf) if we know that pf=.1 from fault tree analysis then through simple algebra we can solve for ps where ps = (1) - (pf) then we would have ps =  (1) - (.1) and ps=.9.

The event tree diagram models all possible pathways from the initiating event. The initiating event starts at the left side as a horizontal line that branches vertically. the vertical branch is representative of the success/failure of the initiating event. At the end of the vertical branch a horizontal line is drawn on each the top and the bottom representing the success or failure of the first event where a description (usually success or failure) is written with a tag that represents the path such as 1s where s is a success and 1 is the event number similarly with 1f where 1 is the event number and f denotes a failure (see attached diagram). This process continues until the end state is reached. When the event tree diagram has reached the end state for all pathways the outcome probability equation is written.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

Steps to perform an event tree analysis:&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

#'''Define the system:''' Define what needs to be involved or where to draw the boundaries.
#'''Identify the accident scenarios:''' Perform a system assessment to find hazards or accident scenarios within the system design.
#'''Identify the initiating events:''' Use a [[hazard analysis]] to define initiating events. 
#'''Identify intermediate events:''' Identify [[countermeasures]] associated with the specific scenario.
#'''Build the event tree diagram'''
#'''Obtain event failure probabilities:''' If the failure probability can not be obtained use [[fault tree analysis]] to calculate it.
#'''Identify the outcome risk:''' Calculate the overall probability of the event paths and determine the [[risk]]. 
#'''Evaluate the outcome risk:''' Evaluate the [[risk]] of each path and determine its acceptability.
#'''Recommend corrective action:''' If the outcome [[risk]] of a path is not acceptable develop design changes that change the [[risk]].
#'''Document the ETA:''' Document the entire process on the event tree diagrams  and update for new information as needed.

==Mathematical concepts==

1 = (probability of success) + (probability of failure)

The probability of success can be derived from the probability of failure.

Overall path probability = (probability of event 1) X (probability of event 2) X (probability of event n....)

==In risk analysis==

Event tree analysis can be used in risk assessment by determining the probability that is used to determine the risk when multiplied by the hazard of the event. Event Tree Analysis is a tool that makes easy to see what pathway is creating the greatest probability of failure for a specific system. It is common to find single point failures that do not have any intervening events between the initiating event and a failure. With Event Tree Analysis single point failure can be targeted to include an intervening step that will reduce the overall probability of failure and thus reducing the risk of the system. The idea of adding an intervening event can happen anywhere in the system for any pathway that generates too great of a risk, the added intermediate event can reduce the probability and thus reduce the risk.

==Advantages==
*Enables the assessment of multiple, co-existing faults and failures&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Functions simultaneously in cases of failure and success&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*No need to anticipate end events&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Areas of single point failure, system vulnerability, and low payoff countermeasures may be identified and assessed to deploy resources properly&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*paths in a system that lead to a failure can be identified and traced to display ineffective countermeasures.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Work can be computerized&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Can be performed on various levels of details&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Visual cause and effect relationship&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Relatively easy to learn and execute&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Models complex systems into an understandable manner&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Follows fault paths across system boundaries&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Combines hardware, software, environment, and human interaction&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Permits probability assessment&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Commercial software is available&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

==Limitations==
*Addresses only one initiating event at a time.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*The initiating challenge must be identified by the analyst&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Pathways must be identified by the analyst&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Level of loss for each pathway may not be distinguishable without further analysis&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Success or failure probabilities are difficult to find.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Can overlook subtle system differences&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Partial successes/failures are not distinguishable&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Requires an analyst with practical training and experience&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

==Software==
Though ETA can be relatively simple, software can be used for more complex systems to build the diagram and perform calculations more quickly with reduction of human errors in the process. There are many types of software available to assist in conducting an ETA. In nuclear industry, RiskSpectrum PSA software is widely used which has both event tree analysis and fault tree analysis. Professional-grade [[free software]] solutions are also widely available. [https://scram-pra.org SCRAM] is an example open-source tool that implements the [https://open-psa.github.io/mef Open-PSA Model Exchange Format] open standard for probabilistic safety assessment applications.

It was created in a former [[quarry]] site, that was used for gravel extraction for years, on Via Bartolomeo Chesi south of the [[Via Aurelia]] ring road in the Malagrotta area. &lt;ref name=romagiardini/&gt;

==Restoration==
The [[habitat restoration]] and [[urban reforestation]] project began in 1998. The area has been completely regraded to create create new hills and drainages to recover the original natural topography. It was then covered with a layer of [[topsoil]] to support a restored [[ecological system]], using ecocelles taken from the nearby estate of Castel di Guido. &lt;ref name=romagiardini/&gt;

The plant species were selected to reestablish the natural environment quickly. Around 1500 new trees were planted on the site,  including: 566 ''[[Quercus pubescens]]'' (downy oak, pubescent oak,), 65 ''[[Quercus robur]] fastigiata'' (columnar English oak), and 562 oaks of other ''[[Quercus]]'' species; 196 ''[[Acer (plant)|Acer]]'' (maples); 96 ''[[Salix]]'' (willow);  and several species of shrubs, such as: [[gorse]], [[privet]], [[myrtus|myrtle]], and [[cistus]]. &lt;ref name=romagiardini/&gt;

'''Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple''' also Gavipuram Cave Temple, an example of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], is located in [[Bangalore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]] in [[India]]. The temple is famous for its mysterious stone discs in the forecourt and the exact planning allowing the sun to shine on shrine in certain time of the year. It was built in the 16th-century by [[Kempe Gowda I]], the founder of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shastry|first1=Vyasa|title=The mysteries of Bengaluru’s famed Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple|url=http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/X3uvXrojiRaPr31fhf6IQI/The-mysteries-of-Bengalurus-famed-Gavi-Gangadhareshwara-tem.html|work=Livemint|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple==
This cave temple dedicated to [[Shiva]] in Bengaluru is a well visited temple. Built in the 16th century AD by Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru, Temple Gavi Gangadhareshwara is an architectural marvel that attracts the faithful by the hordes. One of the oldest temples in Bengaluru, Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple was built by Kempe Gowda in recognition after being released from prison of five years by Rama Raya. There are other idols inside idol Agnimurthi including having two heads, seven hands and three legs. Those who worship this deity believe will cure one of the defects of the eye. The temple is also known for its four monolithic pillars, representing [[Damaru]], [[Trishula|Trishul]] and two fans on the patio.

Built in a natural cave in Gavipuram, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and cut into a monolithic stone. The courtyard of the temple here contains several monolithic sculptures. The main attractions of Gavi Gangadhareshvara temple are two granite pillars that support the giant disk of the sun and moon, while the other two have a number of Nandi at the top.

On the occasion of [[Makar Sankranti]], temple witnesses a unique phenomenon in the evening sunlight passes through an arc between the horns of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] and falls directly on the [[linga]] inside the cave and illuminating the interior idol. This phenomenon is a proof of the technical excellence of the ancient architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Illumination of shrine by the Sun ==
Thousands of devotees come in mid January every year on [[Makar]] [[sankranti]] Day to this cave temple. This is a special day  when the sunrays fall on the [[Shivalinga]] for one hour as it passes between the horns of the [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]. Such was the knowledge of architecture and astronomy that the ancient sculptors could craft the horns of the stone bull  outside the temple so that the sun's rays would pass through its horns and light up the deity [[Shiva]] [[Linga]] inside the cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''geographic names board''' is an official body established by a government to decide on official names for geographical areas and features.

Most countries have such a body, which is commonly (but not always) known under this name. Also, in some countries (especially those organised on a federal basis), subdivisions such as individual states or provinces will have individual boards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29259">'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' is a branch of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] concerned with the study of the motion of [[air]].  It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics|fluid]] and [[gas dynamics]], and the term "aerodynamics" is often used when referring to gas dynamics.

Early records of fundamental aerodynamics concepts date back to the work of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]] in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, but efforts to develop a quantitative theory of air flow did not begin until the 18th century.  In 1726, [[Isaac Newton]] became one of the first aerodynamicists in the modern sense when he developed a theory of air resistance, which was later verified for low flow speeds.  Air resistance experiments were performed by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, aided by the construction of the first [[wind tunnel]] in 1871.  In his 1738 publication ''Hydrodynamica'', [[Daniel Bernoulli]] described a fundamental relationship between pressure, velocity, and density, now termed [[Bernoulli's principle]], which provides one method of calculating [[Lift (force)|lift]].

Aerodynamics work throughout the 19th century sought to achieve [[heavier-than-air]] flight.  [[George Cayley]] developed the concept of the modern fixed-wing aircraft in 1799, and in doing so identified the four fundamental forces of flight - [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[thrust]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[weight]].  The development of reasonable predictions of the thrust needed to power flight in conjunction with the development of high-lift, low-drag airfoils paved the way for the first powered flight.  On December 17, 1903, [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]] flew the first successful powered aircraft.  The flight, and the publicity it received, led to more organized collaboration between aviators and aerodynamicists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.

Theoretical advances in aerodynamics were made parallel to practical ones.  The relationship described by Bernoulli was found to be valid only for incompressible, inviscid flow.  In 1757, [[Leonhard Euler]] published the [[Euler equations]], extending Bernoulli's principle to the compressible flow regime.  In the early 19th century, the development of the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] extended the Euler equations to account for [[viscosity|viscous]] effects.  During the time of the first flights, several investigators developed independent theories connecting [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|flow circulation]] to lift.  [[Ludwig Prandtl]] became one of the first people to investigate [[boundary layer]]s during this time.

==Early aerodynamic thought - antiquity to the 19th century==
[[Image:Design for a Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|A drawing of a design for a flying machine by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1488). This machine was an [[ornithopter]], with flapping wings similar to those of a bird, first presented in his [[Codex on the Flight of Birds]] in 1505.]]

===Theoretical foundations===
Although the modern theory of aerodynamic science did not emerge until the 18th century, its foundations began to emerge in ancient times.  The fundamental aerodynamics [[Aerodynamics#Continuum assumption|continuity assumption]] has its origins in Aristotle's ''Treatise on the Heavens'', although [[Archimedes]], working in the 3rd century BC, was the first person to formally assert that a fluid could be treated as a continuum.{{sfn |Anderson|1997|p = 17}}  Archimedes also introduced the concept that fluid flow was driven by a pressure gradient within the fluid.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp = 18-19}}&lt;ref name="ackroyd"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Ackroyd | first1 = J. A. D. | last2 = Axcell | first2 = B. P. | last3 = Ruban | first3 = A. I. | title = Early Developments of Modern Aerodynamics | location = Reston, Virginia | publisher = [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-56347-516-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea would later prove fundamental to the understanding of fluid flow.

In 1687, Newton's ''Principia'' presented [[Newton's laws of motion]], the first complete theoretical approach to understanding mechanical phenomena.  In particular, [[Newton's second law]], a statement of the [[conservation of momentum]], is one of three fundamental physical principles used to obtain the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier-Stokes equations]].

In 1738, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''Hydrodynamica'', in which he described the fundamental relationship between pressure and velocity, known today as [[Bernoulli's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This states that the pressure of a flowing fluid decreases as its velocity increases and as such was a significant early advance in the theory of [[fluid dynamics]], and was first quantified in an equation derived by [[Leonhard Euler]].{{sfn|Anderson|1997|47}}  This expression, often called [[Bernoulli's principle#Derivations of Bernoulli's equation|Bernoulli's Equation]], relates the pressure, density, and velocity at two points along a streamline within a flowing fluid as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{v_1^2 \over 2}+{p_1\over\rho} = {v_2^2 \over 2}+{p_2\over\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Bernoulli's Equation ignores compressibility of the fluid, as well as the effects of [[gravity]] and viscous forces on the flow.  [[Leonhard Euler]] would go on to publish the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] in 1757, which are valid for both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the [[Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]].

===Studies of air resistance===
[[Image:Governableparachute.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of a glider by [[Sir George Cayley]], one of the early attempts at creating an aerodynamic shape.]]

The retarding effect of air on a moving object was among the earliest aerodynamic phenomena to be explored.  Aristotle wrote about [[Aerodynamic drag|air resistance]] in the 4th century BC,&lt;ref name = "ackroyd"/&gt; but lacked the understanding to quantify the resistance he observed.  In fact, Aristotle paradoxically suggested that the movement of air around a thrown spear both resisted its motion and propelled it forward.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp=16-17}}  In the 15th century, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] published the ''Codex Leicester'', in which he rejected Aristotle's theory and attempted to prove that the only effect of air on a thrown object was to resist its motion,{{sfn|Anderson|1997|p=25}} and that air resistance was proportional to flow speed, a false conclusion which was supported by Galileo's 17th century observations of pendulum motion decay.&lt;ref name="ackroyd" /&gt;  In addition to his work on drag, da Vinci was the first person to record a number of aerodynamic ideas including correctly describing the circulation of vortices and the [[Aerodynamics#Mass continuity|continuity principle]] as applied to channel flow.&lt;ref name="ackroyd"/&gt;

The true quadratic dependency of drag on velocity was experimentally proven independently by [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], both members of the Paris Academy of Sciences, in the late 17th century.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp=32-35}} [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] later became the first person to theoretically derive this quadratic dependence of air resistance in the early 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the first theoretical aerodynamicists.  Newton stated that drag was proportional to the dimensions of a body, the density of the fluid, and the square of the air velocity, a relationship which was demonstrated to be correct for low flow speeds, but stood in direct conflict with Galileo's earlier findings.  The discrepancy between the work of Newton, Mariotte, and Huygens, and Galileo's earlier work was not resolved until advances in viscous flow theory in the 20th century.

Newton also developed a law for the drag force on a flat plate inclined towards the direction of the fluid flow.  Using ''F'' for the drag force, ''ρ'' for the density, ''S'' for the area of the flat plate, ''V'' for the flow velocity, and ''θ'' for the angle of attack, his law was expressed as:  
:&lt;math&gt;F = \rho SV^2 \sin^2 (\theta) &lt;/math&gt;
This equation overestimates drag in most cases, and was often used in the 19th century to argue the impossibility of human flight.&lt;ref name="ackroyd" /&gt;  At low inclination angles, drag depends linearly on the sin of the angle, not quadratically.  However, Newton's flat plate drag law yields reasonable drag predictions for supersonic flows or very slender plates at large inclination angles which lead to flow separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=von Karman, Theodore | title=Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the Light of Their Historical Development | publisher=Dover Publications | year=2004 | isbn=0-486-43485-0 | oclc=53900531}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Anderson|1997|p=40}}

Air resistance experiments were carried out by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | publisher=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (70), 289-298 | year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | publisher=Philosophical Magazine (5)2, 430-441 | year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations for fluid flow with [[friction]] were developed by [[Claude-Louis Navier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Navier, C. L. M. H. | title=Memoire sur les lois du mouvement des fluides | journal=Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=6 |pages=389–440 | year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stokes, G. | title=On the Theories of the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion | publisher=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (8), 287-305 | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; To simulate fluid flow, many experiments involved immersing objects in streams of water or simply dropping them off the top of a tall building. Towards the end of this time period [[Gustave Eiffel]] used his [[Eiffel Tower]] to assist in the drop testing of flat plates.

A more precise way to measure resistance is to place an object within an artificial, uniform stream of air where the velocity is known. The first person to experiment in this fashion was [[Francis Herbert Wenham]], who in doing so constructed the first [[wind tunnel]] in 1871. Wenham was also a member of the first professional organization dedicated to aeronautics, the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Objects placed in wind tunnel models are almost always smaller than in practice, so a method was needed to relate small scale models to their real-life counterparts. This was achieved with the invention of the dimensionless [[Reynolds number]] by [[Osborne Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reynolds, O. | title=An Experimental Investigation of the Circumstances which Determine whether the Motion of Water Shall Be Direct or Sinuous and of the Law of Resistance in Parallel Channels | publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A-174, 935-982 | year=1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds also experimented with [[Laminar flow|laminar]] to [[Turbulence|turbulent]] flow transition in 1883.

[[Image:WB Wind Tunnel.jpg|thumb|A replica of the [[Wright Brothers]]' [[wind tunnel]] is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics.]]

==Developments in aviation==
Working from at least as early as 1796, when he constructed a model helicopter,&lt;ref&gt;Wragg, D.W.; ''Flight before flying'', Osprey, 1974, Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; until his death in 1857, [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] is credited as the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight—[[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Drag (physics)|drag]], and [[thrust]]—and the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = U.S Centennial of Flight Commission - Sir George Cayley.| url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm| publisher = | accessdate = 2008-09-10| quote = Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation.

(Via [[NASA]]). [http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Cayley/Cayley.html Raw text]. Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayley is also credited as the first person to develop the modern fixed-wing aircraft concept; although da Vinci's notes contain drawings and descriptions of a fixed-wing heavier-than-air flight machine, da Vinci's notes were disorganized and scattered following his death, and his aerodynamics achievements were not rediscovered until after technology had progressed well beyond da Vinci's advances.{{sfn|Anderson|1997|pp=21, 25-26}}

By the late 19th century, two problems were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The first was the creation of low-drag, high-lift aerodynamic wings. The second problem was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day [[fluid dynamics]] and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically-inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success.

In 1884, [[John J. Montgomery]], an American trained in physics, began experimenting with glider designs. Using a water table with circulating water and a smoke chamber he began applying the physics of fluid dynamics to describe the motions of flow over curved surfaces such as airfoils.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, CS and Fogel, GB ''Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West,'' University of Oklahoma Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | publisher=L'Aeronaute (22) 73-81 | year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renard and German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] explored the wing loading (weight to wing-area ratio) of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. [[Otto Lilienthal]], following the work of Sir George Cayley, was the first person to become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce high lift and low drag.

[[Octave Chanute]]'s 1893 book, ''Progress in Flying Machines'', outlined all of the known research conducted around the world up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chanute, Octave| title=Progress in Flying Machines | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1997 | isbn=0-486-29981-3 | oclc=37782926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanute's book provided a great service to those interested in aerodynamics and flying machines.

With the information contained in Chanute's book, the personal assistance of Chanute himself, and research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] gained enough knowledge of aerodynamics to fly the first powered aircraft on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers' flight confirmed or disproved a number of aerodynamics theories. Newton's drag force theory was finally proved incorrect. This first widely publicised flight led to a more organized effort between aviators and scientists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.

During the time of the first flights, [[John J. Montgomery]],&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, CS and Fogel, GB ''Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West'' University of Oklahoma Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451-477 | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s. Prandtl, a professor at the [[University of Göttingen]], instructed many students who would play important roles in the development of aerodynamics, such as [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Michael Max Munk|Max Munk]].

==Design issues with increasing speed==
[[Compressibility]] is an important factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to [[aircraft]] design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the [[speed of sound]], a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for [[World War II]] era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800&amp;nbsp;km/h (500&amp;nbsp;mph).

Some of the minor effects include changes to the airflow that lead to problems in control. For instance, the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]] with its thick high-lift wing had a particular problem in high-speed dives that led to a nose-down condition. Pilots would enter dives, and then find that they could no longer control the plane, which continued to nose over until it crashed. The problem was remedied by adding a "dive flap" beneath the wing which altered the center of pressure distribution so that the wing would not lose its lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| isbn=0-9629359-5-6|last=Bodie|first=Warren M.|title=The Lockheed P-38 Lightning|pages= 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem affected some models of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. At high speeds, the [[aileron]]s could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction. This meant that the plane would roll in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, and led to a number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.

The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] had the exact opposite problem in which the controls became ineffective. At higher speeds, the pilot simply couldn't move the controls because there was too much airflow over the control surfaces. The planes would become difficult to maneuver, and at high enough speeds aircraft without this problem could out-turn them.

These problems were eventually solved as jet aircraft reached transonic and [[supersonic]] speeds. German scientists in WWII experimented with [[swept wing]]s. Their research was applied on the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] and bombers such as the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47 Stratojet]] used [[swept wing]]s which delay the onset of shock waves and reduce drag.

In order to maintain control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying tailplanes ([[stabilator]]s), or [[delta wings]] fitted with power operated [[elevons]]. Power operation prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs.

Finally, another common problem that fits into this category is [[Aeroelasticity|flutter]]. At some speeds, the airflow over the control surfaces will become turbulent, and the controls will start to flutter. If the speed of the fluttering is close to a [[harmonic]] of the control's movement, the [[resonance]] could break the control off completely. This was a serious problem on the Zero and [[VL Myrsky]]. When problems with poor control at high speed were first encountered, they were addressed by designing a new style of control surface with more power. However, this introduced a new resonant mode, and a number of planes were lost before this was discovered. On design of VL Myrsky, this problem was countered by increasing the rigidity and weight of the wing, therefore increasing the dampening of the harmonic oscillation, which compromised the performance to some extent.

All of these effects are often mentioned in conjunction with the term "compressibility", but in a manner of speaking, they are incorrectly used. From a strictly aerodynamic point of view, the term should refer only to those side-effects arising as a result of the changes in airflow from an incompressible fluid (similar in effect to water) to a compressible fluid (acting as a gas) as the speed of sound is approached. There are two effects in particular, [[wave drag]] and [[critical mach]].

Wave drag is a sudden rise in drag on the aircraft, caused by air building up in front of it. At lower speeds, this air has time to "get out of the way", guided by the air in front of it that is in contact with the aircraft. But at the speed of sound, this can no longer happen, and the air which was previously following the [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]] around the aircraft now hits it directly. The amount of power needed to overcome this effect is considerable. The critical mach is the speed at which some of the air passing over the aircraft's wing becomes supersonic.

At the speed of sound, the way that lift is generated changes dramatically, from being dominated by [[Bernoulli's principle]] to forces generated by [[shock wave]]s. Since the air on the top of the wing is traveling faster than on the bottom, due to Bernoulli effect, at speeds close to the speed of sound the air on the top of the wing will be accelerated to supersonic. When this happens, the distribution of lift changes dramatically, typically causing a powerful nose-down trim. Since the aircraft normally approached these speeds only in a dive, pilots would report the aircraft attempting to nose over into the ground.

Dissociation absorbs a great deal of energy in a reversible process. This greatly reduces the thermodynamic temperature of hypersonic gas decelerated near an aerospace vehicle. In transition regions, where this pressure dependent dissociation is  incomplete, both the differential, constant pressure heat capacity and beta (the volume/pressure differential ratio) will greatly increase. The latter has a pronounced effect on vehicle aerodynamics including stability.

==Faster than sound – later 20th century==
As aircraft began to travel faster, aerodynamicists realized that the density of air began to change as it came into contact with an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and [[Compressible flow|compressible]] regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the [[speed of sound]]. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the [[heat capacity ratio]]. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]], who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow which included [[Schlieren photography]] techniques to visualize the changes in density. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]]. [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | publisher=Zeitschrift fur Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt (16), 72-74 | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore von Kármán and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.

On September 30, 1935, an exclusive conference was held in [[Rome]] with the topic of high velocity flight and the possibility of breaking the [[sound barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=4th |year=2007 | isbn=0-07-125408-0 | oclc=60589123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included [[Theodore von Kármán]], [[Ludwig Prandtl]], [[Jakob Ackeret]], [[Eastman Jacobs]], [[Adolf Busemann]], [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]], [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]], and Enrico Pistolesi. Ackeret presented a design for a [[supersonic wind tunnel]]. Busemann gave a presentation on the need for aircraft with [[swept wing]]s for high speed flight. Eastman Jacobs, working for [[NACA]], presented his optimized airfoils for high subsonic speeds which led to some of the high performance American aircraft during [[World War II]]. Supersonic propulsion was also discussed. The sound barrier was broken using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft twelve years later, thanks in part to those individuals.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, much of the subsonic and low supersonic aerodynamics knowledge had matured. The [[Cold War]] fueled an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] was started as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using a computer, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.

With some exceptions, the knowledge of [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a [[scramjet]] aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

'''[[Chemical engineering]]''' as a discipline that was developed out of those practising "industrial chemistry" in the late 19th century. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]] (18th century), industrial chemicals and other consumer products such as soap were mainly produced through [[Batch production|batch processing]]. Batch processing is labour-intensive and individuals mix predetermined amounts of ingredients in a vessel, heat, cool or pressurize the mixture for a predetermined length of time. The product may then be isolated, purified and tested to achieve a saleable product.  Batch processes are still performed today on higher value products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, speciality and formulated products such as perfumes and paints, or in food manufacture such as pure maple syrups, where a profit can still be made despite batch methods being slower and inefficient in terms of labour and equipment usage.  Due to the application of Chemical Engineering techniques during manufacturing process development, larger volume [[chemical substances|chemicals]] are now produced through a [[Continuous production|continuous]] "assembly line" [[chemical process]]es. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was when a shift from batch to more continuous processing began to occur. Today [[commodity chemicals]] and [[petrochemicals]] are predominantly made using continuous manufacturing processes whereas [[speciality chemicals]], [[fine chemicals]] and [[pharmaceuticals]] are made using batch processes.

==Origin==
The Industrial Revolution led to an unprecedented escalation in demand, both with regard to quantity and quality, for bulk chemicals such as [[soda ash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kostick|first1=Dennis|title=The origin of the U.S. natural and synthetic soda ash industries|journal=Wyoming State Geological Survey Public Information Circular|date=1998|volume=39|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/soda_ash/soda-ash-industry.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This meant two things: one, the size of the activity and the efficiency of operation had to be enlarged, and two, serious alternatives to batch processing, such as continuous operation, had to be examined.

==The first chemical engineer==
Industrial chemistry was being practised in the mid 1800s, but it was not until the 1880s that the engineering elements required to control chemical processes were being recognized as a distinct professional activity. Chemical engineering was first established as a profession in the United Kingdom when the first chemical engineering course was given at the University of Manchester in 1887 by [[George E. Davis]] in the form of twelve lectures covering various aspects of industrial chemical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delgass|publisher=Purdue University|title=Seventy-Five Years of Chemical Engineering|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/AboutUs/history.html|accessdate=13 August 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence [[George E. Davis]] is regarded as the world's first chemical engineer. Today, chemical engineering is a highly regarded profession. Chemical engineers with experience can become [[Regulation and licensure in engineering#United States|licensed Professional Engineers]] in the United States, aided by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]], or gain "Chartered" chemical-engineer status through the UK-based [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]].

==Professional associations==
In 1880, the first attempt was made to form a ''Society of Chemical Engineers'' in London.  This eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] in 1881. The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) was founded in 1908, and the UK [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.&lt;ref name=Furter&gt;W. F. Furter (1980) A Century of Chemical Engineering, Plenum Press (NY &amp; London) {{ISBN|0-306-40895-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These both now have substantial international membership.  Some other countries now have chemical engineering societies or sections within chemical or engineering societies, but the AIChE, IChemE and IiChE remain the major ones in numbers and international spread: they are both open to suitably qualified professionals or students of chemical engineering anywhere in the world.

==Definitions==
For the other established branches of engineering, there were ready associations in the public's mind: [[Mechanical Engineering]] meant machines, [[Electrical Engineering]] meant circuitry, and [[Civil Engineering]] meant structures. Chemical engineering came to mean [[chemicals production]].

===Unit operation===
[[Arthur Dehon Little]] is credited with the approach chemical engineers to this day take: process-oriented rather than product-oriented analysis and design. The concept of [[Unit operation | unit operations]] was developed to emphasize the underlying similarity among seemingly different chemical productions. For example, the principles are the same whether one is concerned about separating alcohol from water in a fermenter, or separating gasoline from diesel in a refinery, as long as the basis of separation is generation of a vapor of a different composition from the liquid. Therefore, such separation processes can be studied together as a unit operation, in this case called [[distillation]].

===Unit processes===
In the early part of the last century, a parallel concept called [[unit processing|Unit Processes]] was used to classify reactive processes. Thus [[Redox|oxidation]]s, [[Redox|reduction]]s, [[alkylation]]s, etc. formed separate unit processes and were studied as such. This was natural considering the close affinity of chemical engineering to industrial chemistry at its inception. Gradually however, the subject of [[chemical reaction engineering]] has largely replaced the unit process concept. This subject looks at the entire body of chemical reactions as having a personality of its own, independent of the particular chemical species or chemical bonds involved. The latter does contribute to this personality in no small measure, but to design and operate chemical reactors, a knowledge of characteristics such as [[chemical kinetics|rate behaviour]], [[thermodynamics]], single or multiphase nature, etc. are more important.  The emergence of chemical reaction engineering as a discipline signaled the severance of the umbilical cord connecting chemical engineering to industrial chemistry and cemented the unique character of the discipline.

In [[psychology]] and [[ethology]], '''imprinting''' is any kind of phase-sensitive [[learning]] (learning occurring at a particular age or a particular life stage) that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behaviour. It was first used to describe situations in which an animal or person learns the characteristics of some stimulus, which is therefore said to be "imprinted" onto the subject. Imprinting is hypothesized to have a [[critical period]].

== Filial imprinting ==
The best-known form of imprinting is ''filial imprinting'', in which a young animal acquires several of its behavioural characteristics from its parent. It is most obvious in [[nidifugous]] birds, which imprint on their parents and then follow them around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalanswers.co.uk/animals/how-does-animal-imprinting-work/|title=How does animal imprinting work?|work=animalanswers.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first reported in domestic [[chicken]]s, by the 19th-century amateur biologist [[Douglas Spalding]]. It was rediscovered by the early ethologist [[Oskar Heinroth]], and studied extensively and popularized by his disciple [[Konrad Lorenz]] working with [[greylag geese]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;T.L. Brink. (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 12: Developmental Psychology." pp. 268 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH12.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a "[[critical period]]" between 13–16 hours shortly after hatching. For example, the goslings would imprint on Lorenz himself (to be more specific, on his wading boots), and he is often depicted being followed by a gaggle of [[geese]] who had imprinted on him. Lorenz also found that the geese could imprint on inanimate objects. In one notable experiment, they followed a box placed on a model train in circles around the track.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;  Filial imprinting is not restricted to non-human animals that are able to follow their parents, however.

The filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie ''[[Winged Migration]]'' (''Le Peuple Migrateur''), which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight. The birds imprinted on handlers, who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly. The birds were then trained to fly along with a variety of aircraft, primarily [[ultralight]]s.

[[File:Christian Moullec 4.jpg|thumb|300px|Imprinted geese and cranes flying with an ultralight aircraft]]
The Italian [[hang-glider]] pilot [[Angelo d'Arrigo]] extended this technique. D'Arrigo noted that the flight of a non-motorised [[hang-glider]] is very similar to the flight patterns of migratory birds; both use updrafts of hot air (thermal currents) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance. He used this fact to enable the re-introduction into the wild of [[threatened species]] of [[bird of prey|raptors]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/01/guardianobituaries.mainsection, Orbituary: Angelo d'Arrigo The Guardian online, 1 April 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds that are hatched in captivity have no mentor birds to teach them traditional migratory routes. D'Arrigo had one solution to this problem. The chicks hatched under the wing of his glider and imprinted on him. Then, he taught the fledglings to fly and to hunt. The young birds followed him not only on the ground (as with Lorenz) but also in the air as he took the path of various migratory routes. He flew across the [[Sahara]] and over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to [[Sicily]] with [[eagle]]s, from [[Siberia]] to [[Iran]] (5,500&amp;nbsp;km) with a flock of [[Siberian crane]]s, and over [[Mount Everest]] with [[Nepal]]ese eagles. In 2006, he worked with a [[condor]] in South America.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

In a similar project, orphaned [[Canada geese]] were trained to their normal migration route by the Canadian ultralight enthusiast [[Bill Lishman]], as shown in the fact-based movie drama ''[[Fly Away Home]]''.

Chicks of domestic [[chickens]] prefer to be near large groups of objects that they have imprinted on. This behaviour was used to determine that very young chicks of a few days old have rudimentary counting skills. In a series of experiments, they were made to imprint on plastic balls and could figure out which of two groups of balls hidden behind screens had the most balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rugani |first= Rosa |first2=Laura |last2=Fontanari |first3=Eleonora |last3=Simoni |first4=Lucia |last4=Regolin |first5=Giorgio |last5=Vallortigara |title=Arithmetic in newborn chicks |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=276 |issue=1666 |pages=2451–60 |publisher=[[The Royal Society]] |location=London |date=2009-04-01 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/26/rspb.2009.0044.full |issn=0962-8452  |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0044 |pmid=19364746 |pmc=2690459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American coot]] mothers have the ability to recognize their chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. This allows mothers to distinguish their chicks from parasitic chicks.

The [[peregrine falcon]] has also been known to imprint on specific structures for their breeding grounds such as cliff sides and bridges and thus will favour that location for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devine|first1=Ann|title=Peregrine Falcon Dispersal and Habitat Imprinting |date=1994-2013|pages=20|url=https://nres.illinois.edu/files/documents/nres-online-research-devine.pdf |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Sexual imprinting ==
'''Sexual imprinting''' is the process by which a young animal learns the characteristics of a desirable mate. For example, male [[zebra finch]]es appear to prefer mates with the appearance of the female bird that rears them, rather than that of the birth parent when they are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Immelmann |first=Klaus |year=1972 |title=Sexual and other long-term aspects of imprinting in birds and other species |journal= Advances in the Study of Behavior |volume=4 |pages=147–174 |issn=0065-3454 |isbn=0-12-004504-4 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60009-1 |series=Advances in the Study of Behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual attraction to humans can develop in non-human mammals or birds as a result of sexual imprinting when reared from young by humans. One example is London Zoo female [[giant panda]] [[Chi Chi (giant panda)|Chi Chi]]. When taken to [[Moscow Zoo]] for mating with the male giant panda An An, she refused his attempts to mate with her, but made a full sexual self-presentation to a zookeeper.&lt;ref name="nicholls"&gt;Nicholls, Henry (2011). ''The Way of the Panda: The Curious History of China's Political Animal.'' Open Road Media, {{ISBN|978-1-4532-1773-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dobbin"&gt;Dobbin, Muriel (April 24, 1975). D.C. zoo encourages giant pandas to observe nation's birth with own. ''[[Baltimore Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

It commonly occurs in [[falconry]] birds reared from hatching by humans. Such birds are called "imprints" in falconry. When an imprint must be bred from, the breeder lets the male bird copulate with their head while they are wearing a special hat with pockets on to [[semen collection|catch the male bird's semen]]. The breeder then courts a suitable imprint female bird (including offering food, if it is part of that species's normal [[courtship#Courtship in the animal kingdom|courtship]]). At "copulation," the breeder puts the flat of one hand on the female bird's back to represent the weight of a male bird, and with the other hand uses a [[pipette]], or a [[hypodermic syringe]] without a needle, to squirt the semen into the female's [[cloaca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://falconers.com/modern-captive-breeding-part-ii/|title=Modern Captive Breeding–Part II – Falconry related information, laws, supplies for sale|work=falconers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2014}}

Sexual imprinting on inanimate objects is a popular theory concerning the development of [[sexual fetishism]]. For example, according to this theory, imprinting on shoes or boots (as with [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s geese) would be the cause of [[shoe fetishism]].

== Westermarck effect ==
{{Main|Westermarck effect}}
''Reverse'' sexual imprinting is also seen in instances where two people who live in domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one become desensitized to later close [[sexual attraction]]. This phenomenon, known as the [[Westermarck effect]], was first formally described by  [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[anthropologist]] [[Edvard Westermarck]] in his book ''The History of Human Marriage'' (1891). The Westermarck effect has since been observed in many places and cultures, including in the [[Israel]]i [[kibbutz]] system, and the Chinese [[shim-pua marriage]] customs, as well as in biological-related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation. A study of the marriage patterns of these children later in life revealed that out of the nearly 3,000 marriages that occurred across the kibbutz system, only fourteen were between children from the same peer group. Of those fourteen, none had been reared together during the first six years of life. This result provides evidence not only that the Westermarck effect is demonstrable but that it operates during the period from birth to the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Shepher |first=Joseph |year=1983 |title=Incest: A Biosocial View |isbn=0-12-639460-1 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |series=Studies in anthropology |lccn=81006552}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eran Shor and Dalit Simchai claimed that the case of the kibbutzim actually provides little support for the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shor|first=Eran|author2=Simchai, Dalit |title=Incest Avoidance, the Incest Taboo, and Social Cohesion: Revisiting Westermarck and the Case of the Israeli Kibbutzim|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2009|volume=114|issue=6|pages=1803–1842|doi=10.1086/597178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When proximity during this [[critical period]] does not occur—for example, where a brother and sister are brought up separately, never meeting one another—they may find one another highly sexually attractive when they meet as adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This phenomenon is known as [[genetic sexual attraction]]. This observation supports the hypothesis that the Westermarck effect evolved because it suppressed [[inbreeding]]. This attraction may also be seen with [[cousin couple]]s.

[[Sigmund Freud]] argued that as children, members of the same family naturally lust for one another, making it necessary for societies to create [[incest taboo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1913) Totem and Taboo in The Standard edition of the Complete Psychological works of Sigmund Freud, Vol XIII&lt;/ref&gt; but Westermarck argued the reverse, that the taboos themselves arise naturally as products of innate attitudes. [[Steven Pinker]] has written that Freud's conception of an urge to incest may have derived from Freud's own erotic reaction to his mother as a boy (attested in Freud's own writings), and speculates that Freud's reaction may have been due to lack of intimacy with his mother in early childhood, as Freud was [[wet-nursed]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''[[How the Mind Works]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baby duck syndrome ==
[[File:Duck &amp; Ducklings Morning Walk.jpg|300px|thumb|Ducklings following their mother.]]
In [[human–computer interaction]], '''baby duck syndrome''' denotes the tendency for computer users to "imprint" on the first system they learn, then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Allen Kent]]|author2=James G. Williams|author3=Rosalind Kent|title=Encyclopedia of Microcomputers: Geographic information system to hypertext|date=21 June 1991|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-2707-9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that "users generally prefer systems similar to those they learned on and dislike unfamiliar systems".&lt;ref name="seebach"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120419150252/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-cranky50/index.html "Baby duck syndrome: Imprinting on your first system makes change a very hard thing"], Peter Seebach, ''[[IBM DeveloperWorks]]'', 2 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The issue may present itself relatively early in a computer user's experience, and it has been observed to impede education of students in new software systems or [[user interface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom J. van Weert|author2=Robert K.

'''Jingle Cats''' is a series of [[Christmas]] [[novelty record]]ings from producer '''Mike Spalla'''.

The songs are created by Spalla who mixes actual animal sounds to match [[pitch (music)|tones]] of the songs.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; He started with a version of "[[Jingle Bells]]" that was released to radio stations a few years before the full album came out.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; In all, it took more than 1,000 meows, screeches and growls to assemble 20 [[melody|melodies]].&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Wharton, David (1993).

In 1995, ''Here Comes Santa Claws'' won a "Billie" award from Billboard for point-of-purchase category.&lt;ref name="billboard1995"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=1995-05-06|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After following up what Billboard called "excellent" ''Jingle Cats'' and ''Jingle Dogs'' albums, Spalla also produced a ''Jingle Babies'' album for which Billboard described the series  as having hit a "brick wall". &lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt;

NFPA 70B is part of [[NFPA 70]].

==Purpose==

This recommended practice applies to preventive maintenance for electrical, electronic, and communication systems and equipment and is not intended to duplicate or supersede instructions that manufacturers normally provide. Systems and equipment covered are typical of those installed in industrial plants, institutional and commercial buildings, and large multifamily residential complexes.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Tower of Babel]], a common [[symbol]] in discussions of nationalism (painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], 1563)]]
'''Nationalism studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic field devoted to the study of [[nationalism]] and related issues.  While nationalism has been the subject of scholarly discussion since at least the late eighteenth century, it is only since the early 1990s that it has received enough attention for a distinct field to emerge.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Hans Kohn]], [[Elie Kedourie]], [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]], [[Ernest Gellner]], [[Karl Deutsch]], [[Walker Connor]], [[Anthony D. Smith]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] laid the foundation for nationalism studies in the post-war period.  In the early 1990s their ideas were enthusiastically taken up by academics, journalists, and others looking to understand and explain the apparent resurgence of nationalism marked by events such as the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the [[Rwanda genocide]], and the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

==History of the field==

The development of the field can be divided into four stages: (I) the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when nationalism first emerged, and most interest in it was philosophical; (II) the period from the [[First World War]] until the end of the [[Second World War|Second]], when nationalism became a subject of formal academic inquiry; (III) the post-war period from 1945 to the late 1980s, when several [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[political science|political scientists]] developed general theories of nationalism in the context of worldwide [[decolonisation]] and the 'ethnic revival' in the [[Western world|West]]; and (IV) the period following the [[fall of communism]] in 1989, which led to a surge of interest in nationalism and the crystallisation of nationalism studies as a field.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"/&gt;

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
"Up to the First World War," [[Umut Özkirimli]] explains, "interest in nationalism was largely [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]]. The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the [[doctrine]] than with the origins and spread of national phenomena."&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nation-state]] was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Marxists]] expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] world order. In this context, nations and nationalism were taken for granted, and most authors who discussed them were motivated by some political concern. There were no attempts to fashion a general theory of nationalism that was applicable to all cases.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12-13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the important authors in this period include: [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[John Stuart Mill]].

==Nationalism studies as an academic field==

Several universities organize degree and non-degree courses on nationalism. Boston University, University of London (particularly the [[London School of Economics]]), Central European University (Hungary), and University of Edinburgh are among the most prominent institutions where the study of nationalism occupies a central place. The Faculty of Humanities of [[Eötvös Loránd University]] (Hungary) has recently launched a comprehensive short-term program, dedicated exclusively to the study of nationalism.

== The future of the field ==
Authors such as Michal Luczewski and Ruhtan Yalçıne believe that the field is becoming increasingly difficult to study. According to Michal Luczewski, researchers have been talking past each other for decades and there has not been valuable knowledge produced for around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xviii/michal-luczewski/|title=What Remains for Nationalism Studies?|last=Luczewski|first=Michal|date=|website=Institute for Human Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since this time, the field has been stuck between contemporary scientific facts and common-sense theories. Answers to the basic questions of nationalism (What is the Nation? Why does the Nation exist?) have been answered countless times over leaving a swath of contradictory theories and a lack of consensus. The question remains whether it is even possible to construct a universal theory of nationalism. Theories previously proposed are often detached from reality, given the diverse ways in which identities form in different groups around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yalçıner|first=Ruhtan|date=2010-03-01|title=Political Philosophy and Nationalism|url=http://internationalstudies.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276?rskey=YgklCh&amp;result=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

In order to solve for this problem Michal Luczewski recommends that scholars employ greater awareness in addressing the essential questions of nationalism studies. Scholars should produce extensive work dealing “with national phenomena in all their varieties, integrating emotions, cognitions, both the subjective and objective dimensions into one picture.” It is essential for scholars to ignore subjective experience and deal directly with reality. This can be accomplished by utilizing empirical evidence. Luczewski also recommends starting small, “consecutively from the micro level through more and more general steps to the macro one.”

==Journals==

One of the earliest journals devoted to the study of nationalism was the ''[[Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism]]'', founded at the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] by [[Thomas Spira]] in 1973. The journal "[[Nationalities Papers]]" was founded in 1971. Journals in the field include the following:

*''[[Ethnicities (journal)|Ethnicities]]''
*''[[Ethnopolitics]]''
*''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]''
*''[[Immigrants &amp; Minorities]]''

'''Nave's Topical Bible''' is a book written by [[Orville Nave|Orville James Nave]] (1841–1917) and published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]. Nave was a chaplain in the United States Army and referred to his work as "the result of fourteen years of delight and untiring study of the Word of God." &lt;ref name="christianity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.christianity.com/Concordances/|title= Nave's Topical Bible|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topical [[concordance of the Bible]], and contains Biblical references to over 20,000 topics. Scripture is quoted over 100,000 times; the same Scripture citation may appear under several headings.

The topic headings are broad, covering many religious concepts, geographical regions, and names of Biblical figures. While [[theological]] concepts such as [[salvation]] and [[worship]] are included, a wide range of topics, such as Biblical references to [[rope]]s, are also included. This reflects the author's intention, as stated in the book's [[preface]], to "...note and classify everything found in the Scriptures".

The book took fourteen years to complete. Its original copyrights were 1896 and 1897. Until at least 1907 the book was published by the Topical Bible Publishing Company of Lincoln Nebraska. At least seven editions have been published, based on the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Version]] of the Bible. Each verse of the Bible is indexed according to the topics it is classified under. Christian figures such as [[Billy Graham]] have endorsed the book.

'''Nimrod''' (National Institute Machine Radiating on Downs,"the Mighty Hunter" [[Nimrod]]; name attrib. W. Galbraith) was a 7 GeV [[proton]] [[synchrotron]] operating in the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]]  in the [[United Kingdom]] between 1964 and 1978. Nimrod delivered its last particles at 17:00 hrs on 6 June 1978. Although roughly contemporary with the [[Proton Synchrotron|CERN PS]] its conservative design used the "weak focussing" principle instead of the much more cost-effective "strong-focussing" technique, which would have enabled a machine of the same cost to reach much higher energies.

The design and construction of Nimrod was carried out at a capital cost of approximately £11 million. It was used for studies of [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics|sub-nuclear]]
phenomena.

Nimrod was dismantled and the space it occupied reused for the synchrotron of the [[ISIS neutron source]].

==Magnet power supply==
The magnet power supply included 2 motor-alternator-flywheel sets. Each drive motor was 5,000 HP. Each flywheel was 30 tonnes. Each alternator was 60 MVA 12.8kV. Magnet currents would pulse at 10,550 A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspirehep.net/record/918665/files/HEACC63_I_253-261.pdf STATUS REPORT ON NIMROD ...]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16551">A '''paperless office''' (or '''paper-free office''') is a work environment in which the use of paper is eliminated or greatly reduced. This is done by converting documents and other papers into digital form, a process known as [[digitization]]. Proponents claim that "going paperless" can save money, boost productivity, save space, make documentation and information sharing easier, keep personal information more secure, and [[Environmental impact of paper|help the environment]]. The concept can be extended to communications outside the office as well.

==Definition==
The paperless world was a [[publicist]]'s slogan, intended to describe the [[office of the future]]. It was facilitated by the popularization of video display computer terminals like the 1964 [[IBM 2260]]. An early prediction of the paperless office was made in a 1975 ''[[Business Week]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Office of the Future |journal=Business Week |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1975-06-30/the-office-of-the-futurebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |issue=2387 |date=30 June 1975 |pages=48–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that office automation would make paper redundant for routine tasks such as record-keeping and [[bookkeeping]], and it came to prominence with the introduction of the [[personal computer]]. While the prediction of a PC on every desk was remarkably prophetic, the "paperless office" was not. Improvements in [[computer printer|printer]]s and [[photocopier]]s have made it much easier to reproduce documents in bulk, causing the worldwide use of office paper to more than double from 1980 to 2000.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{Citation |title=Technological comebacks: Not dead, just resting|journal=The Economist|date=2008-10-09|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to the increased ease of document production&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; and widespread use of electronic communication, which has resulted in users receiving large numbers of documents that are often printed out. However, since about 2000, at least in the US, the use of office paper has leveled off and is now decreasing, which has been attributed to a generation shift;&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; younger people are believed to be less inclined to print out documents, and more inclined to read them on a full-color interactive display screen. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the average office worker generates approximately two pounds of paper and paperboard products each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/paper/setting/schoolwork.htm |title= Wastes - Resource Conservation - Common Wastes &amp; Materials - Paper Recycling |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "The Paperless Office" was first used in commerce by [[Micronet, Inc.]], an automated office equipment company, in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Paperless Office Trademark Registration |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4801:gp9aaa.2.7 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditional offices have [[paper]]-based filing systems, which may include [[filing cabinet]]s, folders, shelves, [[microfiche]] systems, and drawing cabinets, all of which require maintenance, equipment, considerable space, and are resource-intensive. In contrast, a paperless office could simply have a desk, chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dK-kontorstole.dk/| title=Office Chairs}} Retrieved 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and computer (with a modest amount of local or network storage), and all of the information would be stored in digital form. [[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] could also be used to facilitate the storage of information digitally.

Once computer data is printed on paper, it becomes out-of-sync with [[computer database]] updates. Paper is difficult to search and arrange in multiple sort arrangements, and similar paper data stored in multiple locations is often difficult and costly to track and update. A paperless office would have a single-source collection point for [[distributed database]] updates, and a [[publish-subscribe]] system. Modern computer screens make reading less exhausting for the eyes; a laptop computer can be used on a couch or in bed. With [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, with many other low-cost value-added features like video animation, video clips, and full-length movies, many argue that paper is now obsolete to all but those who are resistant to technological change. [[eBook]]s are often free or low cost compared to hard-copy books.

Others argue that paper will always have a place because it affords different uses than screens [Sellen, A. J., &amp; Harper, R. H. R. (2003). The myth of the paperless office. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.]

==Environmental impact of paper==
{{Main|Environmental impact of paper}}
Paper product manufacturing contributes significantly to [[deforestation]] and man-made [[climate change]], and produces [[greenhouse gas]]es. According to the [[American Forest &amp; Paper Association]], paper manufacturing is the third largest user of fossil fuels worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technewsworld.com/story/68834.html |title= Sustainability Software, Part 2: Cutting the Paper Chase |last1= Madden |first1= Ned |last2= |first2= |date= December 8, 2009 |work= |publisher= TechNewsWorld |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although measures such as [[recycling]] and using [[tree-free paper]] can help reduce the environmental impact of paper, most paper still ends up in landfills. Paper production also leads to air pollution, as paper manufacturing releases [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/air/do/asab/apoc/criteria_pollutants.htm |title= Air Pollutants of Concern |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are major contributors to [[acid rain]], whereas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[greenhouse gas]] responsible for [[climate change]]. Waste water discharged from pulp and paper mills contains solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter that are classified as [[pollutant]]s. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus can cause or exacerbate [[eutrophication]] of fresh water bodies.

Printing [[ink]]s and [[toner]]s are very expensive and use environment-damaging [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and non-renewable oils, although standards for the amount of heavy metals in ink have been set by some regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508062911/http://cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Which|date=May 2011}} [[Deinking]] recycled paper pulp results in a waste slurry, sometimes weighing 22% of the weight of the recycled wastepaper, which may go to [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html|title=Recycling Paper and Glass|date=September 2006|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eliminating paper via automation and electronic forms automation==
The need for paper is eliminated by using online systems, such as replacing index cards and [[rolodex]]es with databases, typed letters and faxes with email, and reference books with the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to eliminate paper is to automate paper-based processes that rely on forms, applications and surveys to capture and share data. This method is referred to as "electronic forms" or e-forms and is typically accomplished by using existing print-perfect documents in electronic format to allow for pre-filling of existing data, capturing data manually entered online by end-users, providing secure methods to submit form data to processing systems, and digitally signing the electronic documents without printing.

The technologies that may be used with electronic forms automation include -
* Portable Document Format ([[PDF]]) - to create, display and interact with electronic documents and forms
* E-form (electronic form) management software - to create, integrate and route forms and form data with processing systems
* Databases - to capture data for prefilling and processing documents
* Workflow platforms - to route information, documents and direct process flow
* E-mail (electronics email) communication which allows sending and receiving information of all kinds and enable attachments
* [[Digital signature]] solutions - to digitally sign documents (used by end-users)
* Web servers - to host the process, receive submitted data, store documents and manage document rights

One of the main issues that has kept companies from adopting paperwork automation is difficulty capturing digital signatures in a cost-effective and compliant manner. The [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act|E-Sign Act of 2000]] in the United States provided that a document cannot be rejected on the basis of an electronic signature and required all companies to accept digital signatures on documents. Today there are sufficient cost-effective options available, including solutions that do not require end-users to purchase hardware or software.

One of the great benefits of this type of software is that you can use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to search the full text of any file. Additionally, tags can be added to each file to make it easier to locate certain files throughout the entire system.

Some paperless software offers a scanner, hardware and software and works seamlessly in separating and organizing important documents. Paperless software might also allow people to enable online signatures for important documents that can be used in any small business or office. Document management and archiving systems do offer some methods of automating forms. Typically, the point in which document management systems start working with a document is when the document is scanned and/or sent into the system. Many document management systems include the ability to read documents via [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) and use that data within the document management system’s framework. While this technology is essential to achieving a paperless office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard D. Walker |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not address the processes that generate paper in the first place.

==Digitizing paper-based documents==
Another key aspect of the paperless office philosophy is the conversion of paper documents, [[photo]]s, engineering plans, [[microfiche]] and all the other paper based systems to digital documents. Technologies that may be used for this include [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, digital mail solutions, book copiers, wide format scanners (for engineering drawings), [[microfiche]] scanners, fax to PDF conversion, [[online post offices]], [[multifunction printer]]s and [[document management system]]s. Each of these technologies uses [[software]] that converts the [[raster format]]s (bitmaps) into other forms depending on need. Generally, they involve some form of [[image compression]] technology that produces smaller [[raster image]]s or use [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) to convert a document into text. A combination of OCR and raster is used to enable search ability while maintaining the original form of the document. An important step is the labeling related to paper-to-digital conversion and the cataloging of scanned documents. Some technologies have been developed to do this, but they generally involve either human cataloging or automated indexing on the OCR document. However, scanners and software continue to improve with the development of small, portable scanners that are able to scan doubled-sided A4 documents at around 30-35ppm to a raster format (typically [[TIFF]] fax 4 or [[PDF]]).

An issue faced by those wishing to take the paperless philosophy to the limit has been [[copyright]] laws. These laws may restrict the transfer of documents protected by copyright from one medium to another, such as converting books to electronic format.

==Securing and tracing documents==

As awareness of identity theft and data breaches became more widespread, new laws and regulations were enacted, requiring companies that manage or store [[personally identifiable information]] to take proper care of those documents. Paperless office systems are easier to secure than traditional filing cabinets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11678601/E-Office_An_Eco-friendly_Advent_of_Cloud_Computing_Technology|title=E-Office: An Eco-friendly Advent of Cloud Computing Technology|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and can track individual accesses to each document.

==Difficulties in adopting the paperless office==
A major difficulty in "going paperless" is that much of a business's communication is with other businesses and individuals, as opposed to just being internal. Electronic communication requires both the sender and the recipient to have easy access to appropriate software and hardware.  Costs and temporary productivity losses when converting to a paperless office are also a factor, as are government regulations, industry standards, legal requirements, and business policies which may also slow down the change. Businesses may encounter technological difficulties such as file format compatibility, longevity of digital documents, system stability, and employees and clients not having appropriate technological skills.

For these reasons, while there may be a reduction of paper, some uses of paper will likely remain indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Sellen, A. J., &amp; Harper, R. H. R. (2003). The myth of the paperless office. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a 2015 questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nearly Half of Businesses are or could go Paperless in 2015|url=http://www.margolis.co.uk/half-businesses-could-go-paperless-2015|publisher=www.margolis.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that nearly half of small/medium-sized businesses believed they were or could go paperless by the end of that year.

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}
'''Participatory budgeting''' (PB) is a process of democratic [[deliberation]] and decision-making, in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a [[municipal]] or public [[budget]]. Participatory budgeting allows [[citizen]]s to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://theconversation.com/the-citizen-budgets-of-africa-make-governments-more-transparent-58275|first=Usman W.|last=Chohan|title=The 'citizen budgets' of Africa make governments more transparent| website=The Conversation|date=2016-04-20|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PB processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/who-we-are/mission-approach/|title=Mission &amp; Approach| website=Participatory Budgeting Project|date=2012-09-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and accountability, increased levels of [[public participation]] (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03252-8.html |title= Participatory Budgeting in Brazil |work= PSUpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frameworks of PB differentiate variously throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. PB, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region's particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of PB vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, PB has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, PB has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porto de Oliveira|first1=Osmany|title=Internatioanl Policy Diffusion and Participatory Budgeting: Ambassadors of Participation, International Institutional and Transnational Networks|date=January 10, 2017|publisher=Springer Nature|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-43337-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB stands as one of several democratic innovations such as [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|British Columbia's Citizens' Assembly]], encompassing the ideals of a [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Röcke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9 |doi=10.1057/9781137326669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, PB has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

==Procedure==
Most broadly, all participatory budgeting schemes allow citizens to deliberate with the goal of creating either a concrete financial plan (a budget), or a recommendation to elected representatives. In the Porto Alegre model, the structure of the scheme gives subjurisdictions (neighborhoods) authority over the larger political jurisdiction (the city) of which they are part. Neighborhood budget committees, for example, have authority to determine the citywide budget, not just the allocation of resources for their particular neighborhood. There is, therefore, a need for mediating institutions to facilitate the aggregation of budget preferences expressed by subjurisdictions.

According to the World Bank Group, certain factors are needed for PB to be adopted: "[...]strong mayoral support, a civil society willing and able to contribute to ongoing policy debates, a generally supportive political environment that insulates participatory budgeting from legislators' attacks, and financial resources to fund the projects selected by citizens."&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=24|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are generally two approaches through which PB formulates: top-down versus bottom-up. The adoption of PB has been required by the federal government in nations such as Peru, while there are cases where local governments initiated PB independent from the national agenda such as Porto Alegre. With the bottom-up approach, NGO's and local organizations have played crucial roles in mobilizing and informing the community members.&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24" /&gt;

PB processes do not adhere to strict rules, but they generally share several basic steps:&lt;ref name="Shah2007p26"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=26|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The municipality is divided geographically into multiple districts.
* Representatives of the divided districts are either elected or volunteered to work with government officials in a PB committee.
* The committees are established with regularly scheduled meetings under a specific timeline to deliberate. 
* Proposals, initiated by the citizens, are dealt under different branches of public budget such as recreation, infrastructure, transportation, etc.
* Participants publicly deliberate with the committee to finalize the projects to be voted on.
* The drafted budget is shared to the public and put for a vote. 
* The municipal government implements the top proposals.
* The cycle is repeated on an annual basis.

== History ==
[[File:Esquina democrática.jpg|thumb|right|Participatory budgeting has been practiced in [[Porto Alegre]] since 1989.]]

Participatory Budgeting was first developed in the 1980s by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Workers' Party]], drawing on the party's stated belief that electoral success is not an end in itself but a spring board for developing radical, participatory forms of democracy. While there were several early experiments (including the public budgeting practices of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] in municipalities such as [[Pelotas]] &lt;ref name="Shah2007p92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Budgeting|last=Shah|first=Anwar|publisher=The World Bank|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8213-6923-4|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6923-4|pages=92|url=http://hdrnet.org/498/1/br_27_56.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the first full participatory budgeting process was implemented in 1989, in the city of [[Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre, Brazil]], a capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a busy industrial, financial, and service center, at that time with a population of 1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making a People's Budget in Porto Alegre. NACLA Report On The Americas|last=Wainwright|first=H.|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=36(5), 37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial success of PB in Porto Alegre soon made it attractive to other municipalities. By 2001, more than 100 cities in Brazil had implemented PB, while in 2015, thousands of variations have been implemented in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =How Participatory Budgeting Travels the Globe|issue = 2|url = http://www.publicdeliberation.net/jpd/vol8/iss2/art8/|journal = Journal of Public Deliberation|volume = 8|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2012-12-30|last1 = Ganuza|first1 = Ernesto|last2 = Baiocchi|first2 = Gianpaolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porto Alegre===

In its [[Constitution of Brazil#Title 1|first Title]], the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Citizen Constitution .281988 .E2.80.93 present.29|1988 Constitution of Brazil]] states that "All power originates from the people, who exercise it by the means of elected representatives or directly, according to the terms of this Constitution." The authoring of the Constitution was a reaction to the previous twenty years of [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], and the new Constitution sought to secure individual liberty while also decentralizing and democratizing ruling power, in the hope that authoritarian dictatorship would not reemerge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/511.short|title = From Clientelism to Cooperation: Local Government, Participatory Policy, and Civic Organizing in Porto Alegre, Brazil|last = Abers|first = Jessica|date = 1998|journal = Politics &amp; Society|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004004|pmid = |access-date = 15 November 2015|pages = 511–537|volume=26|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's contemporary [[political economy]] is an outgrowth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empire's]] patrimonial capitalism, where "power was not exercised according to rules, but was structured through personal relationships".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Social Innovation and the Dialectical Relationship of State and Civil Society|url = http://usj.sagepub.com/content/42/11/2023|journal = Urban Studies|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0042-0980|pages = 2023–2036|volume = 42|issue = 11|doi = 10.1080/00420980500279828|first = Andreas|last = Novy|first2 = Bernhard|last2 = Leubolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Athenian democracy|Athenian ideal of democracy]], in which all citizens participate directly and decide policy collectively, Brazil's government is structured as a [[republic]] with [[Representative democracy|elected representatives]]. This institutional arrangement has created a separation between the state and [[civil society]], which has opened the doors for [[clientelism]]. Because the law-making process occurs behind closed doors, elected officials and bureaucrats can access state resources in ways that benefit certain 'clients', typically those of extraordinary social or economic relevance. The influential clients receive policy favors, and repay elected officials with votes from the groups they influence. For example, a neighborhood leader represents the views of shop owners to the local party boss, asking for laws to increase foot traffic on commercial streets. In exchange, the neighborhood leader mobilizes shop owners to vote for the political party responsible for the policy. Because this patronage operates on the basis of individual ties between patron and clients, true decision-making power is limited to a small network of party bosses and influential citizens rather than the broader public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Toward a Redistributive Democracy|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/461|journal = Politics &amp; Society|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0032-3292|pages = 461–510|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004003|first = BOAVENTURA de SOUSA|last = Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Olívio Dutra]] won the mayor's seat in Porto Alegre. In an attempt to encourage popular participation in government and redirect government resources towards the poor, Dutra institutionalized the PT's organizational structure on a citywide level. The result is one example of what we now know as Participatory Budgeting.

=== Outcomes ===
A [[World Bank]] paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of [[school]]s quadrupled since 1986.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=2}}

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=3}} In a paper that updated the World Bank's methodology, expanding statistical scope and analyzing Brazil's 253 largest municipalities that use participatory budgeting, researchers found that participatory budgeting reallocates spending towards health and sanitation. Health and sanitation benefits accumulated the longer participatory budgeting was used in a municipality. Participatory budgeting does not merely allow citizens to shift funding priorities in the short-term – it can yield sustained institutional and political change in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cps.sagepub.com/content/47/10/1442.full?keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spcps&amp;ijkey=qPmuzabskSFkQ |title= Improving Social Well-Being Through New Democratic Institutions |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper concludes that participatory budgeting can lead to improved conditions for the [[Poverty|poor]]. Although it cannot overcome wider problems such as [[unemployment]], it leads to "noticeable improvement in the accessibility and quality of various [[public welfare]] amenities".{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=1}}

Based on Porto Alegre more than 140 (about 2.5%) of the 5,571 municipalities in Brazil have adopted participatory budgeting.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

==Implementation &amp; Policy Diffusion==
As of 2015, over 1,500 instances of PB have been implemented across the five continents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the democratic spirit of PB remains the same throughout the world, institutional variations abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Budgets for the People|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-11/budgets-people|journal = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru have implemented participatory budgeting in all local governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watsonblogs.org/participatorybudgeting/historypb.html |title=History|work= The Participatory Budgeting Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of towns and cities in [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]] have also initiated participatory budgeting processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | title = Volumen zwei: Endbericht Bürgerhaushalt Europa 5 |trans-title = Volume two | format = PDF | place = [[Germany|DE]] | publisher = Bürgerhaushalt Europa | url = http://www.buergerhaushalt-europa.de/documents/Volumen_zwei_Endbericht_Buergerhaushalt_Europa5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], participatory budgeting has been implemented with public housing, neighbourhood groups, and a public schools, in the cities of [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontohousing.ca/participatory_budgeting|title= Participatory Budgeting – Working together, making a difference | publisher = Toronto Community Housing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guelph]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = PB Hamilton, Ontario | url = http://pbhamont.ca/ | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Vancouver]]. Since its emergence in Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has spread to hundreds of [[Latin America]]n cities, and dozens of cities in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[North America]]. In some cities, participatory budgeting has been applied for school, university, and public housing budgets. In France, the Region [[Poitou-Charentes]] is notable for launching participatory budgeting in its secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Poitou-Charentes' participatory budget in the high schools | type = wiki | contribution-url = http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Poitou-Charentes%27_participatory_budget_in_the_highschools | title = Participedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These international approaches differ significantly, and they are shaped as much by their local contexts as by the Porto Alegre model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Participatory budgeting | publisher = CFE | url = http://www.cfe.org.uk/uploaded/files/Participatory%20Budgeting.pdf | format = PDF | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Participatory budgeting in [[Porto Alegre]] occurs annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite journal | date = December 31, 2002 |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title = Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People | first = David | last = Lewit |journal= Yes! Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porto Alegre spends about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, this money is subject to participatory budgeting.  Annual spending on fixed expenses, such as debt service and pensions, is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre now take part in the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants growing year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name= autogenerated2 /&gt;

The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and assemblies across the city facilitate maximum participation and interaction. Each February there is instruction from city specialists in technical and system aspects of city budgeting. In March there are plenary assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts as well as assemblies dealing with such areas as transportation, health, education, sports, and economic development.  These large meetings—with participation that can reach over 1,000—elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend to respond to citizen concerns. In the following months, delegates meet weekly or biweekly in each district to review technical project criteria and district needs. City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget.  The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
The city of Rosario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rosario.gov.ar/web/gobierno/presupuestos/presupuesto-participativo/resultados-del-presupuesto-participativo-2018|title=Resultados del Presupuesto Participativo 2018|website=Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario|language=es|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina mixed participatory budgeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizenlab.co/blog/civic-engagement/participatory-budgeting/what-if-citizens-set-city-budgets-with-participatory-budgeting/|title=What if citizens set the city budgets? - CitizenLab|website=www.citizenlab.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an approach called ‘gender budgeting’. In practice it means taking appropriate actions to involve more women in the participatory budgeting process, and to make all participants more sensitive of gender issues and the impact of the participatory budgeting projects on these issues.

===United States of America &amp; Canada===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

The first recorded Participatory Budgeting process in the United States of America is in the [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2010-05-27 | url = http://permaculture.org.au/2010/05/27/chicagos-1-3-million-experiment-in-democracy/|title= Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy | place = [[Australia|AU]] | publisher = The Permaculture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Yes Magazine | date = April 10, 2010 | title = Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy; For the First Time in the US, the City's 49th Ward Lets Taxpayers Directly Decide How Public Money is Spent | url = http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/chicagos-1.3-million-experiment-in-democracy| last1 = Lerner | first1 = Josh }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the ward's Alderman, Joe Moore, Chicago's 49th Ward is undertaking this process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ward49.com/participatory-budgeting/ |title= Participatory budgeting | place = Chicago | publisher = 49th Ward|accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Alderman's "Menu Money."  Menu Money is a yearly budgeted amount each of Chicago's 50 wards receives for use on capital expenses. This money in other wards is typically allocated at the complete discretion of a ward's Alderman. Since 2011 more examples have been occurring in the US, in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pbnyc.org/ |title=Participatory budgeting in New York City |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now [[Participatory budgeting in Vallejo, California|citywide in Vallejo, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Public policy | url = http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/davenport-institute/incommon/index.php/2012/04/city-wide-pb-in-vallejo-ca/ | publisher = Pepperdine | title= Participatory budgeting city wide in Vallejo, CA |accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in [[Greensboro, NC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greensboro-nc.gov/index.aspx?page=4796 | publisher = City of Greensboro| title= City of Greensboro NC: Participatory Budgeting |accessdate= December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the first youth-led participatory budgeting process in the US allows teens to decide how to spend $1 million of the city's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youth.boston.gov/youth-lead-the-change/|title=Participatory Budgeting Boston|last=|first=|date=|website=Youth Lead the Change|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Municipal Processes ====

===== Cambridge, Massachusetts =====
Cambridge's first PB occurred in 2014-2015, with $528,000 allocated towards the implementation of six winning projects. Winning projects included one hundred healthy trees, twenty laptops for a community center, bilingual books for children learning english, a public bathroom in Central Square, bike report stations, and free public wifi in six outdoor locations.

===== New York City =====
New York City's Participatory Budgeting process (PBNYC) is the largest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://council.nyc.gov/html/pr/092115launch.shtml|title=Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and New York City Council Launch 2015-2016 Participatory Budgeting Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=New York City Council|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process began in 2011-2012 as a pilot program in four City Council districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/examples-of-participatory-budgeting/|title=Examples of PB|last=|first=|date=|website=Participatory Budgeting Project|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its sixth year (2016-2017), PBNYC has grown to include 31 of the city's 51 districts. Community members in each district decide how to spend at least $1 million of their City Council member's discretionary funds.&lt;ref name="Participate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.council.nyc/pb/participate/|title=Participate|website=New York City Council|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PBNYC cycles run from early fall through the spring. Districts hold neighborhood meetings to collect ideas for community improvement projects. Idea collection is focused particularly on hard-to-reach communities, such as immigrants with limited English proficiency, youth, senior citizens, and public housing residents. Volunteers then research community needs and work with city agencies to turn ideas into concrete proposals. The proposals are put to a community vote, which is open to any resident of the district over the age of 14. City agencies implement the winning projects.&lt;ref name="Participate"/&gt;

==== Housing Complex Processes ====

===== Toronto (Canada) =====
In Toronto Community Housing, PB is part of a broader "tenant participation system." PB has been a part of Toronto Community Housing since 2001. This inspired the launch of a three-year pilot of PB at the ward-level in Toronto, beginning in 2015. In the months of May and June 2018 the city will begin debating what to do with PB at the municipal-level, following annual evaluations of the pilot. Thirty-seven projects have been voted for through the entirety of the three-year pilot process, comprising a total of $1.8 million in residents directly allocating funds towards projects.

===== New York City =====
Citing the case of Toronto, Community Voices Heard (CVH) has called for PB within the [[New York City Housing Authority]] (NYCHA). As part of a platform for democratizing and improving access to public housing, CVH has advocated for developing a kind of participatory system tied together by PB. CVH also advocates for a gradual increase of money being allocated through PB as residents become increasingly familiarized with the process.

===== Los Angeles =====
As part of a broader platform for pushing greater investment and public housing, in early 2014 the LA Human Right to Housing collective began advocating for the use of PB in the [[Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles]] (HACLA). This was in response to a budget corruption scandal in November 2012 in HACLA.According to the Collective, nearly one-hundred residents mobilized to demand PB at a HACLA Agency Plan hearing in August 2014. In response, HACLA launched a "values driven participatory budgeting process" developed and coordinated by a consultant. This was a six-week process, consisting of "resident consultation" that fed into decisions ultimately made by administration and management. Participatory elements of the process were "a resident survey" and "resident review of site specific budgets." The Collective regarded both the design and distribution of the survey to be unsatisfactory. Coupled with a lack of technical support, any kind of resident-focused collective deliberation or evidence of resident influence on the outcome of the process, the Collective deemed the process "participatory in name only."

To counter this, the Collective sought to scale up their campaign for a "true participatory budgeting" process by initiating a Model PB process. The process included a combination of one-on-one and door-to-door outreach with deliberation through meetings and assemblies of residents. The Model PB process resulted in tenants and the Collective deepening their critique of HACLA's PB "in name only" as well as putting forward a number of recommendations to create a "true PB" process.

==== Youth, School, and College Processes ====

===== Greater Boston Area =====
Since 2014 a youth PB process has operated in the city of Boston. Today the process allows persons aged between 12 and 25 years old to decide how to allocate one million dollars.

In 2013-2014 MIT's International Development Group within the school's Department of Urban Studies and Planning conducted an $8,000 PB process. Voting was not over allocating money to specific project proposals, but rather to determining exact allotments to four broad distinct budget categories: field trips, social events, project funding, and cultural event series. To determine precise allotments, "each participant allocated a percentage value of the $8,000 to each category. The average for each category was taken and a preliminary set of results was disclosed." The MIT intra-departmental process provides an example of how PB can be utilized to not only determine the allocation of funds within a specific budget category, but also to determine how funds are distributed across budget categories.

===== Chicago =====
In Spring 2015 Sullivan High School conducted a $25,000 participatory budgeting process. Seventy percent of the student body voted in the process, with the money allocated towards building a new recreation room.

===== New York =====
Within PBNYC youth participation has been semi-formalized in various forms. This includes the youth-led formation of the District 39 PB Youth Committee. District 3 also possesses a PB Youth Committee December 2015, which works in collaboration with an organization called Friends of the High Line. In his State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that PB would be launched in every public high school. Each participating school will receive $2,000 for students to allocate through PB. PB has also been launched at various colleges in the City University of New York. These have included Queens College, Brooklyn College, City Tech, Hunter College, and the CUNY Graduate Center.

===== Phoenix =====
Ten high schools allocated $55,000 of district-wide funds in Phoenix through PB.

===== San Antonio =====
In 2013 a $25,000 PB process was launched at Palo Alto Community College. Initially this was only open to faculty and staff. In fall 2015 the process was opened to students as well. The 2018 process expanded the pot of funds from $25,000 to $50,000.

===United Kingdom===

PB in the United Kingdom was initially introduced as part of the 'New Labour' Party's decentralization agenda that aimed to empower the local governments in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazel Blears]], the Labour MP, "[...] played a key role in the inclusion of PB on the national policy agenda[...]," pushing for greater community participation and empowerment in the governmental structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this new political ambiance, the British PB, inspired by Porto Alegre's example, gained traction for implementation, especially through the active engagement of local NGO's and community activists, namely the Community Pride Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at PB was initiated as a pilot in the city of [[Bradford]] in 2004, and its "procedural model consists of two main steps: the elaboration of project schemes by local community groups and a decision about these schemes by all involved groups during a public meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradford process, while limited to small funding, helped PB spread to other cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to the bottom-up activism in local communities, Blears's initiative for PB on the national level helped promote its implementation and diffusion more broadly, and by 2011, there were at least 150 recorded cases of PB, albeit being limited to small funding and designated personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "UK style" of PB, as Anja Rocke puts it, "in form of small grant-spending processes with no secured financial basis and organized at the margins of the political system," failed to gain enough momentum to be established nationally as a formal decision-making procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scotland ====
The [[Scottish Government]] has made a commitment to participatory budgeting, saying "We support PB as a tool for community engagement and for developing participatory democracy in Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/policies/community-empowerment/participatory-budgeting/|title=Community empowerment: Participatory budgeting - gov.scot|website=beta.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Scottish Government and the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] have agreed that at least 1% of local government budgets will be subject to participatory budgeting by the end of 2021, potentially amounting to £100million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.gov.scot/news/more-choice-for-communities|title=More choice for communities|website=Scottish Government News|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government allocates funding for participatory budgeting through the Community Choices Fund, delivered in partnership between the Government, local authorities, communities and third sector organisations.

===== Support and tools =====
There is a national network to support participatory budgeting called the [https://pbscotland.scot/network PB Scotland Network]. Glasgow Community Planning Partnership has worked with What Works Scotland to develop a toolkit to assess the impact of its PB activities and develop an improvement plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/publications/glasgows-participatory-budgeting-evaluation-toolkit/|title=Glasgow's Participatory Budgeting Evaluation Toolkit {{!}} What Works Scotland|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Review and evaluation =====
A number of analyses and reviews of participatory budgeting in Scotland have been published since 2015, including:

===Republic of Korea===
In 2005, the national government revised its Local Finance Act to promote citizen participation in the local government budgeting process in response to a few of the local governments that initially took a bottom-up approach in experimenting with forms of PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Soonhee|title=Participatory Governance and Polcy Diffusion in Local Governments in Korea: Implementation of Participatory Budgeting|date=January 2016|publisher=Korea Development institute|location=Sejong-si, Korea|isbn=979-11-5932-106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Ministry of Security and Public Administration invested in the nation-wide promotion of PB system diffusion, and under [[Myung Bak Lee|Myung Bak Lee's]] Administration in 2011, the newly revised Local Finance Act required all local governments to adopt PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

Before the 2011 decree, approximately 45% of local governments had already been utilizing the PB system, and it took 3 years for the remaining municipalities to fulfill the mandate.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; The PB System of [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] served as the benchmark for other local governments' adoption of PB in those years.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; Seoul, city with the world's 4th highest GDP, runs a PB committee of 300 people representing 25 districts. The committee is then split into 11 different budgetary fields such as parks and recreation, culture, environment, and etc. In its first year, Seoul citizens voted and finalized on 223 projects worth 50.3 billion KRW, and most recently in 2017, the PB system finalized 766 projects amounting to 59.3 billion KRW (approximately 55 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=참여예산제|url=http://yesan.seoul.go.kr/intro/index.do|website=서울특별시 시민참여예산|publisher=서울특별시청|accessdate=10 March 2018| language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive study of Korea's PB in 2016 suggests that PB in Korea has allocated most of public budget to the following three areas: land/local development, transportation, and culture and tourism. Transparency in budget documents and information sharing has increased since 2011, and the approval rates by local PB committees averaged to approximately 70%. On the other hand, the study also points out that the lack of citizen capacity, inadequate resources for smaller municipalities, and limited representativeness of vested interests as some of the most unresolved challenges in Korea's PB implementation.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

===India===

India's experience with PB has been limited despite its 74th Constitutional Amendment, which proposes to the state and local governments the formation of ward committees composed of local citizens to direct ward-level budgets.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keruwala|first1=Naim|title=Participatory Budgeting in India-The Pune Experiment|journal=The Budget Bulletin|date=June–August 2013|volume=V|url=http://www.nfi.org.in/sites/default/files/newsletter/THE%20BUDGET%20BULLETIN_1.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such initiative was not implemented, and thus there were only few cities that experimented with PB, which are [[Bangalore]], [[Myso]], [[Pune]], and [[Hiware Bazar]].&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Bangalore was the first to implement PB in India in 2001 with the help of a local NGO. Similarly, Pune was able to adopt PB in 2006 with the help of several local NGOs. Pune's PB system was met with a large response from its local citizens, and multiple online and offline workshops were carried out to foster the implementation&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; As a result, Pune has experienced both increased citizen participation and budget allocation, which are directed primarily towards roads, electricity, slum-improvement, and water shortage.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; Influenced by Pune's PB, Pimpri-Chinchwad, the fifth-most populated city of Maharashtra, also began to adopt the framework soon after.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Hiware Bazar may have served as the most successful example of PB in India. On June 25, 2015, Delhi Deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia presented the Swaraj Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Highlights of Swaraj budget presented by deeputy CM SH Manish Sisodia | url = http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/highlights-of-swaraj-budget-presented-by-deputy-cm-sh-manish-sisodia | publisher = Aam Admi party}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aam Admi Party Swaraj Budget was prepared based on voting from the people of different constituencies. In each constituency three meetings were held; each meeting  was attended by 200–300 residents, and a list of key issues was prepared, which was then voted on to decide the top priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times of India | publisher = India Times | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Aam-aadmi-gives-Swaraj-budget-a-thumbs-up/articleshow/46981634.cms | title = Aam Admi gives Swaraj budget a thumbs up}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qk6YyKRRIk0C&amp;pg=PT3 |title=Swaraj |work= Books |isbn=9789350299371 |last1=Kejriwal |first1=Arvind |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/page/goal-of-swaraj|title=Goal of Swaraj | publisher = Aam Aadmi Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the village, once bereft of water, education, and basic needs for life, is now self-sufficient with a high per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Dhara|first1=Sagar|title=Including People in Governance|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/including-people-in-governance/article6483234.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===

For South Africa, the mechanisms for citizen participation is written in its constitution. Each municipality has its budgetary committee formed with representatives from its 'wards' that deal directly with its budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank Group's research lists [[Mangaung]] and [[Ekurhuleni]] municipalities as representative cases to demonstrate the typical PB process in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the process for the council is fixed by the mayor, who sets up certain deadlines for the council to deliberate within.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the municipality is divided geographically into 'wards', and  the public budget is drawn with any desired submission from the community through their ward representatives.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt; The tentatively accumulated budget plan is then publicized so that any citizens or "stakeholders" can make their final inputs, and the final version is submitted to the national and provincial governments for approval.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt;

On a nation-wide level, the South African municipalities, as a result of PB, have witnessed the public budget "shift from infrastructure development to local economic development, a higher priority for citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, PB is being carried out in 284 municipalities, each varying slightly in its process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of transparency for the municipal governments has increased because the sub-organization ward committees are able to maintain consistently ongoing communication with the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the challenges in South African local governance still prevail as a result of the lack of resources and limited capacities assigned to PB. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences also provide immediate obstacles for holistic communications between various wards and social groups within the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The Better Neighbourhoods participatory budgeting project of the wider [[citizen sourcing]] Better Reykjavik project of the City of Reykjavik was established in 2011. Nearly 2 million Euros (300 million ISK) has been allocated each year with over citizen proposed 100 projects funded most years. The project is mostly driven by digital participation with secure electronic voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizens.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Better-Neighbourhoods-Participatory-budgeting-in-Reykjavik-2011-2015.pdf|title=Better Neighborhoods 2011 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Citizens Foundation|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/754a9442-af7b-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2|title=The world watches Reykjavik's digital democracy experiment|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buenos Aires===
Buenos Aires adopted the PB process in 2001 hoping to emerge a political economy. There were manipulators like people watching the system and third parties forming for or against the PB system. Buenos aires used a system where the communities allocated where the government would take action first by ranking where the cities resources would go. After participation decreased by 50% in the 2005 cycle, PB came to an end and "the new communes" emerged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Reviewing the experience in Brazil and Porto Alegre a [[World Bank]] paper points out that lack of representation of extremely poor people in participatory budgeting can be a shortcoming. Participation of the very poor and of the young is highlighted as a challenge.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=5}} What are the insights regarding the opportunities for and barriers to accomplishing the goal of participatory-based budgeting? It takes leadership to flatten the organizational structure and make conscious ethical responsibilities as individuals and as committee members try to achieve the democratic goals means that the press should be present for the public, and yet the presence of the press inhibits the procedural need for robust discussion. Or, while representation is a cornerstone to participatory budgeting, a group being so large has an effect on the efficiency of the group. Participatory budgeting may also struggle to overcome existing [[clientelism]]. Other observations include that particular groups are less likely to participate once their demands have been met and that slow progress of public works can frustrate participants.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

In Chicago, participatory budgeting has been criticized for increasing funding to recreational projects while allocating less to infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/04/24/pitfalls-participatory-budgeting|title=The Pitfalls of Participatory Budgeting|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tonight {{!}} WTTW|access-date=2017-12-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''penetration''', in [[firestop]]ping, is an ''opening'', such as one created by the use of a cast-in-place [[Sleeve (construction)|sleeve]], in a wall or floor assembly required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]], for the purpose of accommodating the passage of a mechanical, electrical or structural [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrant]]. The penetration may or may not contain a firestop system. A ''penetration'' is not a ''penetrant''. A penetration may or may not include a penetrant.

==Old terminology==

The nuclear industry in particular used to refer to firestops as "penetration seals" or "penseals". These terms are superseded by the term [[firestop]]. Whereas penetration seals or penseals only dealt with openings made to accommodate [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]], firestops now also include [[Joint (building)]].

==Why the term "Penetration (firestop)"?==

It is useful to have clarity in [[construction]] communications, to differentiate between the ''opening'', whether sealed or not, and the [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]], which are optional components of a penetration, as sometimes openings (penetrations of the fire barrier) are created for future use, especially in electrical service rooms. A firestop, after all, tends to be easier to remove than [[concrete]], which requires coredrilling equipment, cooling water, etc. A firestopped penetration may also be referred to as a firestop, as a firestop, by definition, is a [[system]]. Therefore, the terms ''firestop'' and ''penetration'' can at times be deemed to be interchangeable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5597">'''Phloem loading''' is the process of loading [[carbon]] into the [[phloem]] for transport to different '[[Sink (biology)|sinks]]' in a plant. Sinks include [[metabolism]], growth, storage, and other processes or organs that need carbon [[Solution|solutes]] to persist. It can be a passive process, relying on a pressure gradient to generate diffusion of solutes through the [[symplast]], or an active process, requiring energy to create membrane-bound [[transporter protein]]s that move solutes through the [[apoplast]] against a gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamalei|first=Yuri|year=1991|title=Phloem loading and its development related to plant evolution from trees to herbs|url=|journal=Trees|volume=5|pages=50–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive phloem loading transports solutes freely through [[plasmodesma]] in the symplast of the minor veins of leaves. [[Active transport]] occurs [[apoplast]]ically and does not use plasmodesmata. An intermediate type of loading exists that uses symplastic transport but utilizes a size-exclusion mechanism to ensure diffusion is a one-way process between the mesophyll and phloem cells. This process is referred to as polymer-trapping, in which simple solutes such as sucrose are synthesized into larger molecules such as [[stachyose]] or [[raffinose]] in intermediary cells. The larger molecules cannot diffuse back to the mesophyll but can move into the phloem's [[sieve cells]]. Therefore, the synthesis of larger compounds uses energy and is thus 'active' but this strategy does not require specialized proteins and can still move [[symplast]]ically.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turgeon|first=Robert|last2=Medville|first2=Richard|last3=Nixon|first3=Kevin|year=2001|title=The evolution of minor vein phloem and phloem loading|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=88|pages=1331–1339|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Yuri Gamalei first described the different types of phloem-loading mechanisms in 1989, correlating loading strategy with the [[Leaf anatomy|leaf's anatomy]]. He found that plasmodesmatal abundance in the minor veins of leaves was correlated with a plant's loading strategy. Plasmodesmata allow solutes to diffuse through the symplast. Thus, plants with a lot of plasmodesmata are generally passive loaders. Plants with few or absent plasmodesmata are usually active loaders since they do not have a way for solutes to pass through the symplast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamalei|first=Yuri|year=1989|title=Structure and function of leaf minor veins in trees and herbs - A taxonomic review|url=|journal=Trees|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=96–110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Robert Turgeon and colleagues found that plasmodesmatal frequency is not the sole indicator of a plant's phloem-loading strategy. While the presence of abundant plasmodesmata does allow for passive, symplastic transport, it does not exclude the possibility of active, apoplastic transport. The amount of plasmodesmata in a leaf is an aspect of a species' [[Leaf anatomy|anatomy]] and not necessarily a determinant of phloem-loading strategy. Plants with a polymer-trapping mechanism may have an abundance of plasmodesmata, but this trait alone does not indicate this loading strategy. Therefore, to accurately determine phloem-loading mechanisms, the type and amount of transport solute must also be identified. A plant's phloem-loading strategy can be accurately determined by combining data on solute type, solute concentration and plasmodesmatal abundance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phloem loading and growth form ==
Active phloem loading requires less carbon, allowing carbon allocation to other sinks in the plant, such as growth. Active phloem loading allows for higher growth potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turgeon|first=Robert|year=2010|title=The role of phloem loading reconsidered|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=152 |issue=4|pages=1817–1823|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbaceous plants have a relatively high growth rate and many are active phloem loaders. Active loaders tend to have a high [[hydraulic conductivity]] and low solute concentrations, while passive loaders have high solute concentrations and a low hydraulic conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Qiushi|last2=Cheng|first2=Lailiang|last3=Guo|first3=Yangdong|last4=Turgeon|first4=Robert|year=2011|title=Phloem loading strategies and water relations in trees and herbaceous plants|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=157 |issue=3|pages=1518–1527|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also exhibit high solute concentrations and low hydraulic conductivity and thus are thought to be passive loaders. Based on early research, scientists correlated herbaceous species with active loading and trees and other woody species with passive loading. However, in 2011, Davidson et al. examined the correlation between growth from and phloem-loading strategy. They found that a loose association exists but not a definitive correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Anna|last2=Keller|first2=Felix|last3=Turgeon|first3=Robert|year=2011|title=Phloem loading, plant growth form, and climate|url=|journal=Protoplasma|volume=248 |issue=1|pages=153–163|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees exhibit active loading, while some herbs exhibit passive loading, and many species have mechanisms of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oner-Sieben|first=Soner|last2=Lohaus|first2=Gertrud|year=2014|title=Apoplastic and symplastic phloem loading in Quercus robur and Fraxinus excelsior|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=65 |issue=7|pages=1905–1916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1254">'''Power Alley''' is a term used in [[audio engineering]] to denote the line between [[subwoofer]]s where output from each subwoofer is [[Phase (waves)|in phase]] and is noticeably louder.

==Problem==
Subwoofers placed at each side of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] will typically cancel unpredictably everywhere in the listening area except along the center line between the [[Loudspeaker|speakers]].  Because of this, placing subwoofer [[Loudspeaker enclosure|cabinets]] together tends to give a smoother response to each member of the audience. 
This is explained in detail in "The Power Alley ".&lt;ref&gt;Brusi, Joe: ''The "Power Alley" - Discussion &amp; Solutions To The Troubling Interaction Of Subwoofer Stacks'', http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/in_search_of_the_power_alley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
Centering the subwoofers between the high end cabinets tends to minimize the timing 
error throughout the listening area.&lt;ref&gt;Pādrick, Tim: ''Subwoofer Info'', http://www.padrick.net/LiveSound/SubwooferInfo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of separated subwoofers are more predictable outdoors, but subwoofers are often placed together as a starting point for indoor venues, too.

The '''Institute of Food Research''' ('''IFR''') transitioned into [[Quadram Institute|the Quadram Institute]] Bioscience in April 2017. This restructuring was in preparation for moving to the [[Quadram Institute]] which is being constructed in partnership with the University of East Anglia and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

==Foundation==
The Institute of Food Research was created in {{Start date and age|1968}}, when it was spread over four sites; the [[Meat Research Institute]] (MRI) at Langford near [[Bristol]], the Food Research Institute (FRI) at [[Colney]] in Norwich, the National Institute for Research in Dairying (NIRD) in [[Shinfield]] near Reading, and the [[Long Ashton Research Station]] (food related departments only of the last two).  At the end of 1990, the Meat Research Institute Bristol laboratory was closed, and in 1992, the National Institute for Research in Dairying Reading laboratory was moved onto the campus of the [[University of Reading]].  In 1998, it was decided that the Institute's activities should be consolidated in one location: Norwich, which was completed in September 1999.&lt;ref name="IFR_history"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://IFR.ac.uk/about/history/|title=A Short History of Food Research|website=IFR.ac.uk|publisher=Institute of Food Research|location=[[Norwich]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''rCOS'''  stands for refinement of  [[Object (philosophy)|object]] and [[Software component|component]] systems. It is a [[formal method]] providing [[component-based]] [[model-driven software]] development.

==Overview==
rCOS was originally developed by [[He Jifeng]], [[Zhiming Liu (computer scientist)|Zhiming Liu]] and Xiaoshan Li at [[UNU-IIST]] in [[Macau]], and consists of a unified multi-view modeling notation with a theory of relational semantic and graph-based [[operational semantics]], a [[refinement calculus]] and tool support for model construction, model analysis and verification, and [[model transformation]]s. Model transformations automate refinement rules and design patterns and generate conditions as proof obligations.  rCOS support multiple dimensional modeling: models at different levels of abstraction related by refinement relations, hierarchy of compositions of components, and models of different views of the system ([[interaction protocol]]s of components, reactive behaviors of components, data functionality, and class structures and data types). Components are composed and integrated based on their models of interfaces to support third party composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |title=rCOS |work=[[UNU-IIST]] |publisher=[[Archive.org]] |date=2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113133741/http://rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Araucaria heterophylla 01.jpg|thumb|220px|Naturally-occurring ramification helps gives these [[Pinophyta|conifers]] a regular, [[cone (geometry)|cone]]-shaped outline.]]
In [[botany]], '''ramification''' is the divergence of the [[Plant stem|stem]] and limbs of a [[plant]] into smaller ones, i.e. [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] into [[branch]]es, branches into increasingly smaller branches, etc. Gardeners stimulate the process of ramification through [[pruning]], thereby making [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and other plants bushier and denser. 

Short [[internodes]] (the section of stem between nodes, i.e. areas where [[leaf|leaves]] are produced) help increase ramification in those plants that form branches at these nodes.  Long internodes (which may be the result of over-watering, the over-use of [[fertilizer]], or a seasonal "growth spurt") decrease a gardener's ability to induce ramification in a plant.

A high degree of ramification is essential for the creation of [[topiary]] as it enables the topiary artist to carve a bush or [[Hedge (barrier)|hedge]] into a shape with an even surface.  Ramification is also essential to practitioners of the [[Bonsai aesthetics|art of bonsai]] as it helps recreate the form and habit of a full-size tree in a small tree grown in a container.

The pruning practices of [[coppicing]] and [[pollarding]] induce ramification by removing most of a tree's mass above the root.  [[Fruit trees pruning|Fruit tree pruning]] increases the yield of [[orchards]] by inducing ramification and thereby creating many vigorous, fruitful branches in the place of a few less-fruitful ones.

'''Religion and peacebuilding''' refers to the study of religion's role in the development of peace. Scholars generally accept that religion has been, at different points in history, both advantageous and [[religion and violence|ruinous to the promotion of peace]]&lt;ref&gt;John Siebert, "Religion and Violent Conflict: A Practitioner's Functional Approach," The Ploughshares Monitor, Vol 28, No.2 (Summer 2007),pp9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many approaches to explaining this variability.

Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner categorize these approaches into three models. The first is “peace through religion alone”. This proposes to attain world peace through devotion to a given religion. Opponents claim that advocates generally want to attain peace through their particular religion only and have little tolerance of other ideologies. 
The second model, a response to the first, is “peace without religion”. Critics claim that it is overly simplistic and fails to address other causes of conflict as well as the peace potential of religion. It is also said that this model excludes the many contributions of religious people in the development of peace. Another critique claims that both approaches require bringing everyone into their own ideology.

The third and final approach is known as “peace with religion”. This approach focuses on the importance of coexistence and interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner, "Religion and Peace and COnflict Studies," in Critical Issues in Peace and Conflict Studies, ed. Thomas Matyok, Jessica Senehi, and Sean Byrne (Toronto: Lexington Books, 2011), pp 351-358.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrie ter Haar suggests that religion is neither inherently good nor bad for peace, and that its influence is undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie ter Haar, "Religion: Source of Conflict or Resource for Peace?" in Bridge or Barrier: Religion, Violence and Visions for Peace, ed. Gerrie ter Haar and James J. Busuttil (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2005), pp. 18-36&lt;/ref&gt; Peace with religion, then, emphasises promoting the common principles present in every major religion.

A major component of religion and peacebuilding is faith-based [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Douglas Johnston points out that faith-based NGOs offer two distinct advantages. The first is that since faith-based NGOs are very often locally based, they have immediate influence within that community. He argues that “it is important to promote indigenous ownership of conflict prevention and peacebuilding initiatives as early in the process as possible.” The second advantage Johnston presents is that faith-based NGOs carry [[moral authority]] that contributes to the receptivity of negotiations and policies for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Johnston, "Faith-Based Organizations: The Religious Dimension of Peacebuilding." in People Building Peace II: Successful Stories of Civil Society, ed Paul van Tongeren, et al (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 2005), pp. 209-218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism and peacebuilding==

===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew Bible contains many sources for religious peacebuilding. Some of which include:

*The [[Priestly Blessing]] ({{bibleverse||Numbers|6:24–26|HE}}) ends with: "May God lift up his face onto you and give you '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Leviticus|26:6|HE}}: "And I shall place '''peace''' upon the land"
*{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:12|HE}}: "Behold I give him my covenant of '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|57:19|HE}}: '''Peace, peace''' to the distant and the close"
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|11:5|HE}}: The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|34:15|HE}}: "Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it"
*{{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:17-18|HE}}:" The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|HE}}:The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together;and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
* {{Bible verse||Isaiah|2:4|121}} &amp; {{Bible verse||Micah|4:3|121}} They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.

===Project Ploughshares===
{{Main|Project Ploughshares}}
[[Project Ploughshares]] is a Canadian non-government organization concerned with the prevention of war, the [[disarmament]] of weapons, and peacebuilding. Though it is an agency of the [[Canadian Council of Churches]] and is sponsored by the nine national churches of Canada, Project Ploughshares is run by and for people of a variety of different faith backgrounds. Project Ploughshares works with various NGOs operating abroad to develop research and complete analyses of government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/faq#FAQ5|title=FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Project Ploughshares' work has included meeting with prime ministers to discuss nuclear disarmament, establishing and coordinating an agency for disarmament and security of the Horn in Africa, working with the UN and NATO on policy-making, and publishing research papers, one of which was endorsed by over 40 000 Canadians and had a serious influence over Canada's decision not to declare war on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/accomplishments|title=Accomplishments|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Ploughshares takes its name from Isaiah 2:4 where it is written "God shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their [[swords into ploughshares]], and spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pax Christi===
{{Main|Pax Christi}}
[[Pax Christi]] is the "official international Catholic peace movement" as recognized by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Marie, [http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html “Pax Christi International”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304180629/http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html |date=2014-03-04 }} ‘’CMSM Forum," Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded after [[World War II]] as reconciliary movement by French citizens including Bishop [[Pierre-Marie Théas]] of [[Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes|Tarbes and Lourdes]]. First goal was the reconciliation between [[France]] and [[Germany]]; the German branch or section later concentrated on reconciliation with [[Poland]] and initiated the foundation of the [[:de:Maximilian-Kolbe-Werk]].

Today the Pax Christi network membership is made up of 18 national sections and 115 Member Organizations working in over 50 countries,
focusing on five main issues: human rights, human security, disarmament and demilitarisation, just world order, and religion and peace.

==The Bahá'í Faith and peacebuilding==

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] requires believers to avoid prejudice in daily life, to be friendly to people of all [[religions]], social statuses, nationalities or various [[culture|cultural]] traditions. At the nation's level, it calls for negotiation and dialogue between country leaders, to promote the process of world peace. For world peace, the Bahá'í Faith has the notion of "the Lesser Peace" and "the Great Peace". The previous one is considered the level of political peace, that a peace treaty is signed, and wars are eliminated; the latter refers to [[God]]'s kingdom on earth, the world reaches its unity and in cooperation, all world's people uses an auxiliary language, a unified currency system, achieves economic justice, a world tribunal is available, and massive disarmament of all countries.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], discouraged all forms of violence, including religious violence, writing that his aim was to: ``quench the flame of hate and enmity" and that the ``religion of God is for love and unity; make it not the cause of enmity or dissension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kitab-i-Ahd|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned of the dangers of religious fanaticism describing it as a ``world devouring fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=288|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited holy war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Bisharat|pages=21|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned the shedding of blood, the burning of books, the shunning of the followers of other religions and the extermination of communities and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of the World|pages=91|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] promoted the concept of the oneness of the world and human beings describing the Earth as "but one country, and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of Maqsud|pages=167|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] identified the elimination of disunity as a necessary pre-requisite to peace.  "The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=286|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, as a contribution to the 1986 International Year of Peace, the international governing body of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[the Universal House of Justice]], released a major statement on the promotion of peace, that was distributed worldwide by the Bahá'í community. The statement sets out an analysis and strategy for creation of a more peaceful world. It identifies the following barriers to peace: racism, economic injustice, uncontrolled nationalism, religious strife, inequality between man and women, an absence of universal education, and the need for an international auxiliary language. The statement concludes with a call for establishment of the "oneness of humanity", a call which implies "no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world — a world organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated units."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Promise of World Peace|url=http://www.bahai.org/documents/the-universal-house-of-justice/promise-world-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism and peacebuilding==

===Engaged Buddhism===
{{Main|Engaged Buddhism}}

'''Engaged Buddhism''' is a term coined by [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] in the 1960s to describe a more socially active form of Buddhism. Originating during the [[Indochina Wars]] with Nhat Hanh and the [[Unified Buddhist Church]], adherents of Engaged Buddhism became participants in the war, not against the Americans or the Vietnamese, but against the violence itself, which they saw as unnecessary. They attempted to draw attention to the injustices of the war by placing themselves directly between the lines of battle and even engaging in [[self immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp38-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged Buddhism represents a socially aware non-violent movement within the larger Buddhist community. Inspired by the Buddhist tradition of the Peace Wheel and the teachings of non-violence of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], Engaged Buddhism has since spread to other conflicts in other countries, with groups in Tibet, struggling for self-determination; in Burma and Cambodia, advocating for human rights; in [[Sri Lanka]], promoting the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]]; and in India, working with [[Dalit|untouchables]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp39&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also since opened up churches in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner''' (27 (or 25) February 1861&lt;ref&gt;Steiner's autobiography gives his date of birth as 27 February 1861. However, there is an undated autobiographical fragment written by Steiner, referred to in a footnote in his autobiography in German (GA 28), that says, "My birth fell on 25 February 1861. Two days later I was baptized." See Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', [[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt]] 1992, {{ISBN|3-499-50500-2}}, p. 8.

In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between [[science]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, the movement arts (developing a new artistic form, [[eurythmy]]) and architecture, culminating in the building of the [[Goetheanum]], a cultural centre to house [[Gesamtkunstwerk|all the arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Sokolina, Anna, ed.

Steiner advocated a form of ethical [[individualism]], to which he later brought a more explicitly spiritual approach. He based his [[epistemology]] on [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s world view, in which "Thinking… is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rudolf | last = Steiner | title = Goethean Science | id = GA1 | year = 1883}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A consistent thread that runs from his earliest philosophical phase through his later spiritual orientation is the goal of demonstrating that there are no essential limits to human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Helmut | last1 = Zander | first2 = Schweizer | last2 = Fernsehen | title = Sternstunden Philosophie: Die Anthroposophie Rudolf Steiners | language = de | type = program | date = 15 February 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and education ===
[[File:Rudolf Steiner Geburtshaus,Donji Kraljevec, Croatia.JPG|thumb|left|The house where Rudolf Steiner was born, in present-day [[Croatia]]]]
Steiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829 – 1910), left a position as a [[gamekeeper]]&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Rudolf Steiner Publ. Penguin 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the service of Count [[House of Hoyos|Hoyos]] in [[Geras, Austria|Geras]], northeast [[Lower Austria]] to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 [[Horn, Austria|Horn]] – 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Murakirály ([[Donji Kraljevec|Kraljevec]]) in the ''[[Muraköz]]'' region of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austrian Empire]] (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the [[Medjimurje|Međimurje]] region of northernmost [[Croatia]]). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to [[Mödling]], near [[Vienna]], and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to [[:de:Pottschach|Pottschach]], located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian [[Alps]] in [[Lower Austria]].&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

Steiner entered the village school, but following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of [[:de:Neudörfl|Neudörfl]] and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the [[realschule]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].&lt;ref name=Auto&gt;Rudolf Steiner [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/English/APC1928/GA028_index.html Autobiography: Chapters in the Course of My Life: 1861–1907], Lantern Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chap. 2}}
[[File:Rudolf Steiner als Abiturient.jpg|right|thumb|Rudolf Steiner, graduation photo from secondary school]]
In 1879, the family moved to [[Inzersdorf (Vienna)|Inzersdorf]] to enable Steiner to attend the [[TU Wien|Vienna Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;In Austria passing the ''[[matura]]'' examination at a [[Gymnasium (school)]] was required for entry to the University.[http://www.superfarm.net/pedagogika/images/stories/2007-5-eng/2007_05_eng_07-dr_tadej_vidmar-the_gymnasium_as_a_general.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; where he enrolled in courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[mineralogy]] and audited courses in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, at the end of which time he withdrew from the Institute without graduating.&lt;ref name=Zander2&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', Göttingen, 2007, {{ISBN|3-525-55452-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122,443,446,456,503}}&lt;ref name=ZanderBio&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Rudolf Steiner: Die Biografie|year=2011|publisher=Piper|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, [[:de:Karl Julius Schröer|Karl Julius Schröer]],&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c03.html Chap. 3]}} suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Ahern, Sun at Midnight, Publ. Cambridge, Clarke 2010 Rev Ed. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Heidenreich]], [http://southerncrossreview.org/36/heidenreich.htm Rudolf Steiner – A Biographical Sketch]&lt;/ref&gt; a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications.&lt;ref name=ZanderBio/&gt;{{rp|43}}

Before attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Fichte]] and [[F. W. J. Schelling|Schelling]].&lt;ref name = CorrDoc&gt;Steiner, ''Correspondence and Documents 1901-1925'', 1988, p. 9. {{ISBN|0880102071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early spiritual experiences ===
[[File:Steiner als Student.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner as 21-year-old student (1882)]]
When he was nine years old, Steiner believed that he saw the spirit of an aunt who had died in a far-off town asking him to help her at a time when neither he nor his family knew of the woman's death.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner. ''Esoteric Lessons 1904–1909''. SteinerBooks, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner later related that as a child he felt "that one must carry the knowledge of the spiritual world within oneself after the fashion of geometry ... [for here] one is permitted to know something which the mind alone, through its own power, experiences. In this feeling I found the justification for the spiritual world that I experienced ... I confirmed for myself by means of geometry the feeling that I must speak of a world 'which is not seen'."&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;

Steiner believed that at the age of 15 he had gained a complete understanding of the concept of time, which he considered to be the precondition of spiritual [[clairvoyance]].&lt;ref name="CorrDoc"/&gt; At 21, on the train between his home village and [[Vienna]], Steiner met an herb gatherer, Felix Kogutzki, who spoke about the spiritual world "as one who had his own experience therein".&lt;ref name="Auto"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, GA 262, pp. 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Kogutzki conveyed to Steiner a knowledge of nature that was non-academic and spiritual.

=== Writer and philosopher ===
In 1888, as a result of his work for the Kürschner edition of [[Goethe]]'s works, Steiner was invited to work as an editor at the Goethe archives in [[Weimar]]. Steiner remained with the archive until 1896. As well as the introductions for and commentaries to four volumes of Goethe's scientific writings, Steiner wrote two books about Goethe's philosophy: ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/ "Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception"], also translated as ''Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview''&lt;/ref&gt; which Steiner regarded as the [[epistemological]] foundation and justification for his later work,&lt;ref&gt;Preface to 1924 edition of [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_pre1924.html ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception, with Specific Reference to Schiller''], in which Steiner also wrote that the way of knowing he presented in this work opened the way from the sensory world to the spiritual one.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Goethean Science'', Mercury Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-936132-92-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-936132-92-1}}, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA001/English/MP1988/GA001_index.html link]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also collaborated in complete editions of the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the writer [[Jean Paul]] and wrote numerous articles for various journals.

[[File:Rudolf Steiner um 1891.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rudolf Steiner around 1891/92, etching by Otto Fröhlich]]
In 1891, Steiner received a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]], for his dissertation discussing 
[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte's]] concept of the ego,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His thesis title was ''Die Grundfrage der Erkenntnistheorie mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Fichte's [[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]] – Prolegomena zur Verständigung des philosophierenden Bewusstseins mit sich selbst''.&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to [[:de:Heinrich von Stein|Heinrich von Stein]], whose ''Seven Books of Platonism'' Steiner esteemed.&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c14.html Chap. 14]}} Steiner's dissertation was later published in expanded form as ''Truth and Knowledge: Prelude to a Philosophy of Freedom'', with a dedication to [[Eduard von Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA003/index.php ''Truth and Knowledge'' (full text)]. {{lang-de|Wahrheit und Wissenschaft – Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Freiheit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he published ''Die Philosophie der Freiheit'' (''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]'' or ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity''—Steiner's preferred English title) (1894), an exploration of [[epistemology]] and ethics that suggested a way for humans to become spiritually free beings. Steiner later spoke of this book as containing implicitly, in philosophical form, the entire content of what he later developed explicitly as [[anthroposophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prokofieff, ''May Human Beings Hear It!'', Temple Lodge, 2004. p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Steiner.jpg|upright|thumb|Marie Steiner 1903]]
In 1896, Steiner declined an offer from [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] to help organize the Nietzsche archive in [[Naumburg]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Her brother]] by that time was ''[[non compos mentis]]''. Förster-Nietzsche introduced Steiner into the presence of the [[catatonic]] philosopher; Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'' Garber Communications; 2nd revised edition (July 1985) {{ISBN|978-0893450335}}. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA005/English/GC1985/GA005_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner later related that:

:"My first acquaintance with Nietzsche's writings belongs to the year 1889. Previous to that I had never read a line of his. Upon the substance of my ideas as these find expression in ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'', Nietzsche's thought had not the least influence....Nietzsche's ideas of the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal recurrence]]' and of '[[Übermensch]]' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the 19th century....What attracted me particularly was that one could read Nietzsche without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of Nietzsche's."&lt;ref name=Auto/&gt;{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c18.html Chap. 18]}}

In 1897, Steiner left the [[Weimar]] archives and moved to Berlin. He became part owner of, chief editor of, and an active contributor to the literary journal ''Magazin für Literatur'', where he hoped to find a readership sympathetic to his philosophy. Many subscribers were alienated by Steiner's unpopular support of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Tarcher/Penguin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the journal lost more subscribers when Steiner published extracts from his correspondence with anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]].&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Dissatisfaction with his editorial style eventually led to his departure from the magazine.

In 1899, Steiner married Anna Eunicke; the couple separated several years later. Anna died in 1911.

=== Theosophical Society ===
{{Main article|Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society}}
[[File:Steiner mit Annie Besant.jpg|right|thumb|Rudolf Steiner in Munich with Annie Besant, leader of the Theosophical Society. Photo from 1907]]
In 1899, Steiner published an article, "Goethe's Secret Revelation", discussing the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale ''[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]''. This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] on the subject of Nietzsche. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902 without ever formally joining the society.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravagli/&gt; It was also in connection with this society that Steiner met and worked with [[Marie von Sivers]], who became his second wife in 1914. By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [[Annie Besant]] to be leader of the Theosophical ''Esoteric Society'' for Germany and Austria. In 1904, Eliza, the wife of [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], became one of his favourite scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer| first1= Thomas|title= Helmuth von Moltke, Light for the new millennium: Rudolf Steiner's association with Helmuth and Eliza von Moltke: letters, documents and after-death communications''|publisher= Rudolf Steiner Press|place= London|year= 1997|ISBN= 1-85584-051-0|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Through Eliza, Steiner met Helmuth, who served as the [[German General Staff|Chief of the German General Staff]] from 1906 to 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.it/books?isbn=0521791014|title= Helmuth Von Moltke and the Origins of the First World War|first1= Annika|last1= Mombauer |date= April 19, 2001|ISBN= 9780521019569|website= Google Books|language= en|access-date= Jun 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In contrast to mainstream Theosophy, Steiner sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his [[spiritual science]]. During this period, Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing [[H. P. Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]'s terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of [[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant|Besant]]'s claim that [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] was the vehicle of a new ''Maitreya'', or world teacher,&lt;ref&gt;See Lutyens, Mary (2005). J. Krishnamurti: A Life. New Delhi: Penguin Books India. {{ISBN|0-14-400006-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a formal split in 1912/13,&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the [[Anthroposophical Society]]. Steiner took the name "Anthroposophy" from the title of a work of the Austrian philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann]], published in Vienna in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann's ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft.: Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage'': Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'', 11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]. Steiner took the name but not the limitations on knowledge which Zimmerman proposed. Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his departure from the Theosophical Society, Steiner maintained his interest in Theosophy throughout his life.&lt;ref name=RSLib&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37618538/The_Library_of_Rudolf_Steiner_The_Books_in_English The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English], Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthroposophical Society and its cultural activities ===
[[File:RudolfSteiner.jpeg|right|thumb]]
The [[Anthroposophical Society]] grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by [[Edouard Schuré]] and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first [[Goetheanum]] building, in [[Dornach]], Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once World War I started in 1914, the Goetheanum volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction. Steiner moved from [[Berlin]] to Dornach in 1913 and lived there to the end of his life.&lt;ref  name=HausHansi&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36947843/The_Home_of_Rudolf_Steiner_Haus_Hansi The Home of Rudolf Steiner: Haus Hansi], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 126:19-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous [[#Breadth of activity|practical institutions and activities]], including the first [[Waldorf schools|Waldorf school]], founded that year in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. At the same time, the Goetheanum developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1922/1923, the building burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|752}}&lt;ref name=GA259&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rudolf Steiner |title=Das Schicksalsjahr 1923 in der Geschichte der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft: vom Goethanumbrand zur Weihnachtstagung: Ansprachen, Versammlungen, Dokumente, Januar bis Dezember 1923 |publisher=Rudolf Steiner Verlag |pages=750–790 (esp. 787)|year=1991 |isbn=978-3-7274-2590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|796}} Steiner immediately began work designing a [[Goetheanum|second Goetheanum]] building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.

At a "Foundation Meeting" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas, 1923, Steiner spoke of laying a new [[:Wikisource:Foundation Stone meditation|Foundation Stone]] for the society in the hearts of his listeners. At the meeting, a new "General Anthroposophical Society" was established with a new executive board. At this meeting, Steiner also founded a School of Spiritual Science, intended as an "organ of initiative" for research and study and as "the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science''. Publ. Temple Lodge 2006. p.xiii, {{ISBN|1902636805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This School, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, [[Waldorf education|education]], [[Anthroposophical medicine|medicine]], performing arts ([[eurythmy]], speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts. Later sections were added for the social sciences, youth and agriculture.&lt;ref name=GoethRestruct&gt;[https://www.goetheanum.org/Overview.481.0.html?&amp;L=1 1923/1924 Restructuring and deepening.

=== Political engagement and social agenda ===
Steiner became a well-known and controversial public figure during and after World War I. In response to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, he proposed extensive social reforms through the establishment of a [[Threefold Social Order]] in which the cultural, political and economic realms would be largely independent. Steiner argued that a fusion of the three realms had created the inflexibility that had led to catastrophes such as [[First World War|World War I]]. In connection with this, he promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of [[Upper Silesia]], claimed by both Poland and Germany. His suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Zeitung'', 4 March 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner opposed [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s proposal to create new European nations based around ethnic groups, which he saw as opening the door to rampant nationalism. Steiner proposed as an alternative "'social territories' with democratic institutions that were accessible to all inhabitants of a territory whatever their origin while the needs of the various ethnicities would be met by independent cultural institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Werner (2011), "Rudolf Steiner zu Individuum und Rasse: Sein Engagement gegen Rassismus und Nationalismus", in ''Anthroposophie in Geschichte und Gegenwart''. trans. Margot M. Saar&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks, illness, and death ===
The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] gained strength in Germany after the First World War. In 1919, a political theorist of this movement, [[Dietrich Eckart]], attacked Steiner and suggested that he was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Uwe Werner, ''Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus'', Munich (1999), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Adolf Hitler]] attacked Steiner on many fronts, including accusations that he was a tool of the Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defendingsteiner.com/sources/hitler-steiner.php ''Völkischer Beobachter'', 15 March 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; while other nationalist extremists in Germany called for a "war against Steiner". That same year, Steiner warned against the disastrous effects it would have for Central Europe if the National Socialists came to power.&lt;ref name="Werner" /&gt;{{rp|8}} In 1922 a lecture Steiner was giving in Munich was disrupted when stink bombs were let off and the lights switched out, while people rushed the stage apparently attempting to attack Steiner, who exited safely through a back door.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''The Esoteric Aspect of the Social Question: The Individual and Society'', Steinerbooks, p xiv and see also Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'', pp. 769–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Riot at Munich Lecture", New York Times, 17 May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to guarantee his safety, Steiner's agents cancelled his next lecture tour.&lt;ref name=GL/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Marie Steiner, Introduction, in Rudolf Steiner, ''Turning Points in Spiritual History'', Dornach, September 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich led Steiner to give up his residence in Berlin, saying that if those responsible for the attempted coup [Hitler and others] came to power in Germany, it would no longer be possible for him to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesberger, [http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html Die Krise der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft 1923] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606014838/http://www.anthroposophy.com/aktuelles/wiesberger.html |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 on, Steiner showed signs of increasing frailness and illness. He nonetheless continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently. Many of these lectures focused on practical areas of life such as education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lindenberg, Christoph, ''Rudolf Steiner: Eine Biographie'' Vol. II, Chapter 52. {{ISBN|3-7725-1551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rudolf Steiner Grabmal Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Steiner's gravestone at the Goetheanum]]
Increasingly ill, he held his last lecture in late September, 1924. He continued work on his autobiography during the last months of his life; he died on 30 March 1925.

=== Spiritual research ===
Steiner first began speaking publicly about spiritual experiences and phenomena in his 1899 lectures to the Theosophical Society. By 1901 he had begun to write about spiritual topics, initially in the form of discussions of historical figures such as the [[mysticism|mystics]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. By 1904 he was expressing his own understanding of these themes in his essays and books, while continuing to refer to a wide variety of historical sources.

"A world of spiritual perception is discussed in a number of writings which I have published since this book appeared. ''The Philosophy of Freedom'' forms the philosophical basis for these later writings. For it tries to show that the experience of thinking, rightly understood, is in fact an experience of spirit." (Steiner, Philosophy of Freedom, Consequences of Monism)

Steiner aimed to apply his training in [[mathematics]], science, and philosophy to produce rigorous, verifiable presentations of those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenberg, "Schritte auf dem Weg zur Erweiterung der Erkenntnis", pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that through freely chosen [[ethics|ethical]] disciplines and [[meditation|meditative training]], anyone could develop the ability to experience the [[spirit|spiritual world]], including the higher nature of oneself and others.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Steiner believed that such [[discipline]] and training would help a person to become a more [[morality|moral]], [[creativity|creative]] and [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] [[individuality|individual]] – free in the sense of being capable of actions motivated solely by love.&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt; His philosophical ideas were affected by [[Franz Brentano]],&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; with whom he had studied,&lt;ref&gt;Steiner described Brentano's ''Psychology from the Empirical Standpoint'' (1870) as symptomatic of the weakness of a psychology that intended to follow the method of natural science but lacked the strength and elasticity of mind to do justice to the demand of modern times: Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, "Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Fichte, [[Hegel]], Schelling, and Goethe's [[Goethean science|phenomenological approach to science]].&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockemühl, J., ''Toward a Phenomenology of the Etheric World'' {{ISBN|0-88010-115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelglass, S. et al., ''The Marriage of Sense and Thought'', {{ISBN|0-940262-82-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner followed [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] in using the term ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'', usually translated as "spiritual science".&lt;ref&gt;Dilthey had used this term in the title of one of the works listed in the Introduction to Steiner's ''Truth and Science'' (the doctoral dissertation) as concerned with the theory of cognition in general: ''Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften, usw.'', (Introduction to the Spiritual Sciences, etc.) published in 1883.{{cite web |url=http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417102908/http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner used the term to describe a discipline treating the spirit as something actual and real, starting from the premise that it is possible for human beings to penetrate behind what is sense-perceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0058/19091014p01.html "The Mission of Spiritual Science"], lecture 1 of ''Metamorphoses of the Soul: Paths of Experience'', Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that psychology, history, and the humanities generally were based on the direct grasp of an ideal reality,&lt;ref&gt;''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'', ch XIX&lt;/ref&gt; and required close attention to the particular period and culture which provided the distinctive character of religious qualities in the course of the evolution of consciousness. In contrast to William James' pragmatic approach to religious and psychic experience, which emphasized its idiosyncratic character, Steiner focused on ways such experience can be rendered more intelligible and integrated into human life.&lt;ref&gt;''William James and Rudolf Steiner'', Robert A. McDermott, 1991, in ReVision, vol.13 no.4 [http://www.ciis.edu/Documents/Academic%20Departments/PCC/McDermott_William%20James%20and%20Rudolf%20Steiner.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner proposed that an understanding of reincarnation and karma was necessary to understand psychology&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Reincarnation and Karma: Concepts Compelled by the Modern Scientific Point of view'', in ''Lucifer Gnosis'' 1903.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/ReinKarma/ReKarm_e01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the form of external nature would be more comprehensible as a result of insight into the course of karma in the evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA235/English/RSP1972/Karm01_intro.html Introductory note to ''Karmic Relationships'']&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1910, he described aspects of karma relating to health, natural phenomena and free will, taking the position that a person is not bound by his or her karma, but can transcend this through actively taking hold of one's own nature and destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner ''Manifestations of Karma'' 4th edition 2000 {{ISBN|1855840588}}. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ManfKarma/ManKar_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In an extensive series of lectures from February to September 1924, Steiner presented further research on successive reincarnations of various individuals and described the techniques he used for karma research.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These lectures were published as [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA235/English/RSP1972/Karm01_index.html Karmic Relationships: Esoteric Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric schools===
{{see also|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner was founder and leader of the following: 
* His independent ''Esoteric School'' of the Theosophical Society, founded in 1904. This school continued after the break with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] but was disbanded at the start of World War I.
* A lodge called ''Mystica Aeterna'' within the [[Ancient and Primitive Rite|Masonic Order of Memphis and Mizraim]], which Steiner led from 1906 until around 1914. Steiner added to the Masonic rite a number of Rosicrucian references.&lt;ref&gt;Ellic Howe: ''The Magicians of the Golden Dawn'' London 1985, Routledge, pp 262 ff&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The School of Spiritual Science of the Anthroposophical Society, founded in 1923 as a further development of his earlier Esoteric School. This was originally constituted with a general section and seven specialized sections for education, literature, performing arts, natural sciences, medicine, visual arts, and astronomy.&lt;ref name=GoethRestruct/&gt;&lt;ref name="wn.rsarchive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisabeth Vreede]], who Steiner had nominated as the first leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section, was responsible for the posthumous 1926 edition of Steiner's astronomy course, concerning this branch of natural science from the point of view of Anthroposophy and spiritual science, under the title ''The Relationship of the various Natural-Scientific Subjects to Astronomy'', [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA323/English/LR81/AstCrs_foreword.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner gave members of the School the first Lesson for guidance into the esoteric work in February 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenther Wachsmuth]], ''The Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner from the Turn of the Century to his Death.'' p.53. Translated by Olin D. Wannamaker and Reginald E. Raab. 1955, Whittier Books (New York), 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Though Steiner intended to develop three "classes" of this school, only the first of these was developed in his lifetime (and continues today). An authentic text of the written records on which the teaching of the First Class was based was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science: The First Class'', Temple Lodge Publishing, 2006, p.xii. The detailed account is given in chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breadth of activity ==
After the First World War, Steiner became active in a wide variety of cultural contexts. He founded a number of schools, the first of which was known as the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]],&lt;ref&gt;IN CONTEXT No. 6, Summer 1984&lt;/ref&gt; which later evolved into a worldwide school network. He also founded a system of organic agriculture, now known as [[biodynamic agriculture]], which was one of the very first forms of, and has contributed significantly to the development of, modern [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/biodynamic.html ATTRA – National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Anthroposophic medicine|work in medicine]] led to the development of a broad range of complementary medications and supportive artistic and biographic therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. and Rodger, I. ''Anthroposophical Medicine: Treating Body, Soul and Spirit''&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous homes for children and adults with [[developmental disabilities]] based on his work (including those of the [[Camphill movement]]) are found in Africa, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://camphill.net/silo/files/camphill-international-directory.pdf Camphill list of communities]&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings and drawings influenced [[Joseph Beuys]] and other modern artists. His two [[Goetheanum]] buildings have been widely cited as masterpieces of [[modern architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;Both Goetheanum buildings are listed as among the most significant 100 buildings of modern architecture by Goulet, Patrice, ''Les Temps Modernes?'', L'Architecture D'Aujourd'hui, December 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Rudolf_Steiner.html Rudolf Steiner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051601/http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Rudolf_Steiner.html |date=24 September 2015 }}, Great Buildings Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brennan, [http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/reviews/brennan/brennan3-18-98.asp rudolf steiner], ''Artnet''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hortola, Policarp.

Steiner's [[literary estate]] is correspondingly broad. Steiner's writings, published in about forty volumes, include books, essays, [[Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas|four plays]] ('mystery dramas'), mantric verse, and an autobiography. His collected lectures, making up another approximately 300 volumes, discuss an extremely wide range of themes. Steiner's drawings, chiefly illustrations done on blackboards during his lectures, are collected in a separate series of 28 volumes. Many publications have covered his architectural legacy and sculptural work.

=== Education ===
[[File:Ecole Steiner-Waldorf Verrieres2.jpg|thumb|The Waldorf school in [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (France)]]
{{main article|Waldorf education}}
As a young man, Steiner was a private tutor and a lecturer on history for the Berlin ''Arbeiterbildungsschule'',&lt;ref name=zander2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Anthroposophie in Deutschland|year=2007|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational initiative for working class adults.&lt;ref name=njacobs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nicholas|title=The German Social Democratic Party School in Berlin, 1906–1914|journal=History Workshop|date=Spring 1978|volume=5|pages=179–187|doi=10.1093/hwj/5.1.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, he began to articulate his ideas on education in public lectures,&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt; culminating in a 1907 essay on ''The Education of the Child'' in which he described the major phases of child development which formed the foundation of his approach to education.&lt;ref&gt;The original essay was published in the journal ''Lucifer-Gnosis'' in 1907 and can be found in Steiner's collected essays, ''Lucifer-Gnosis 1903-1908'',
GA34. This essay was republished as an independent brochure in 1909; in a [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/EduChild/EduChi_note.html Prefatory note to this edition], Steiner refers to recent lectures on the subject. An English translation can be found in [http://waldorfcurriculum.com/FREE/THE%20EDUCATION%20of%20the%20child.pdf ''The Education of the Child: And Early Lectures on Education''] (first English edition 1927, Second English edition 1981, London and New York, 1996 edition {{ISBN|978-0-88010-414-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of education was influenced by the [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbartian]] pedagogy prominent in Europe during the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name=zander2007/&gt;{{rp|1362, 1390ff}}&lt;ref name="Ullrich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullrich|first=Heiner|title=Rudolf Steiner|year=2008|publisher=Continuum International Pub. Group|location=London|isbn=9780826484192|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Steiner criticized Herbart for not sufficiently recognizing the importance of educating the will and feelings as well as the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, [http://steiner.presswarehouse.com/sites/steiner/research/archive/spirit_of_the_waldorf_school/spirit_of_the_waldorf_school.pdf ''The Spirit of the Waldorf School''], {{ISBN|9780880103947}}. pp. 15-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, [[Emil Molt]] invited him to lecture to his workers at the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart. Out of these lectures came a new school, the Waldorf school. In 1922, Steiner presented these ideas at a conference called for this purpose in [[Oxford]] by Professor [[Millicent Mackenzie]]. He subsequently presented a teacher training course at [[Torquay]] in 1924 at an [[Anthroposophy]] Summer School organised by [[Eleanor Merry]].&lt;ref name=Torquay&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36404489/Torquay_In_the_Footsteps_of_Rudolf_Steiner Torquay: In the Footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 125 (Mar): 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Conference and the Torquay teacher training led to the founding of the first Waldorf schools in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain]. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3 (1): 53–66.&lt;/ref&gt; During Steiner's lifetime, schools based on his educational principles were also founded in [[Hamburg]], [[Essen]], [[The Hague]] and London; there are now more than 1000 [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] worldwide.

=== Biodynamic agriculture ===
{{Main article|Biodynamic agriculture}}
In 1924, a group of farmers concerned about the future of agriculture requested Steiner's help. Steiner responded with a lecture series on an [[ecological agriculture|ecological]] and [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] approach to agriculture that increased soil fertility without the use of [[chemical fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref name="BD1924"/&gt; Steiner's agricultural ideas promptly spread and were put into practice internationally&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.oalib.com/paper/2894417 "The secrets of Koberwitz: The diffusion of Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course and the founding of Biodynamic Agriculture"], ''Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy'', 2(1):19–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biodynamic agriculture]] is now practiced in Europe,&lt;ref name=olympiad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|title=Organics Olympiad 2011: Global Indices of Leadership in Organic Agriculture|journal=Journal of Social and Development Sciences|year=2011|volume=1|issue=4|pages=144–150|url=http://orgprints.org/18860/1/Paull2011OlympiadJSDS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America, South America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/06/biodynamic-coffee-in-brazil|title=Biodynamic coffee farming in Brazil|last=Purvis|first=Andrew|date=2009-12-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenafricadirectory.org/listing/biodynamic-agricultural-association-of-southern-africa/|title=Biodynamic Agricultural Association of Southern Africa - Green Africa Directory|work=Green Africa Directory|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Asia&lt;ref name="olympiad"/&gt; and [[Australasia]].&lt;ref name=Koberwitz&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://www.organic-systems.org/journal/Vol_6(1)/pdf/6(1)-Paull-pp27-41.pdf "Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924–1938"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2011, 6(1):27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodynamics.com/regional.html Groups in N.

A central aspect of biodynamics is that the farm as a whole is seen as an organism, and therefore should be a largely self-sustaining system, producing its own [[manure]] and [[Fodder|animal feed]]. Plant or animal disease is seen as a symptom of problems in the whole organism. Steiner also suggested timing such agricultural activities as sowing, weeding, and harvesting to utilize the influences on plant growth of the [[moon]] and [[planets]]; and the application of natural materials prepared in specific ways to the [[soil]], [[composting|compost]], and crops, with the intention of engaging non-physical beings and elemental forces. He encouraged his listeners to verify his suggestions [[scientific method|empirically]], as he had not yet done.&lt;ref name="Koberwitz"/&gt;

=== Anthroposophical medicine ===
{{Main article|Anthroposophical medicine}}
From the late 1910s, Steiner was working with doctors to create a new approach to medicine. In 1921, [[pharmacist]]s and physicians gathered under Steiner's guidance to create a pharmaceutical company called [[Weleda]] which now distributes natural medical products worldwide. At around the same time, Dr. [[Ita Wegman]] founded a first anthroposophic medical clinic (now the Ita Wegman Clinic) in [[Arlesheim]].

=== Social reform===
{{main article|Threefold Social Order}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was active as a lecturer on social reform. A petition expressing his basic social ideas was widely circulated and signed by many cultural figures of the day, including [[Hermann Hesse]].

In Steiner's chief book on [[social reform]], ''Toward Social Renewal'', he suggested that the cultural, political and economic spheres of society need to work together as consciously cooperating yet independent entities, each with a particular task: political institutions should establish [[Equality before the law|political equality]] and protect [[human rights]]; cultural institutions should nurture the free and unhindered development of science, art, education and religion; and economic institutions should enable producers, distributors and consumers to cooperate to provide efficiently for society's needs.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', Harper San Francisco 1984 {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw such a division of responsibility, which he called the [[Threefold Social Order]], as a vital task which would take up consciously the historical trend toward the mutual independence of these three realms. Steiner also gave suggestions for many specific social reforms.

Steiner proposed what he termed a "fundamental law" of social life:

{{Quote|The well-being of a community of people working together will be the greater, the less the individual claims for himself the proceeds of his work, i.e. the more of these proceeds he makes over to his fellow-workers, the more his own needs are satisfied, not out of his own work but out of the work done by others.|Steiner|The Fundamental Social Law&lt;ref name=Fundamental&gt;Steiner (1917), [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/FuSoLa_index.html "The Fundamental Social Law"], translated in ''Selected writings
of Rudolf Steiner'' (1993), Richard Seddon (Ed.), Rudolf Steiner Press, Bristol. {{ISBN|1 85584 005 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He expressed this in the motto:&lt;ref name=Fundamental/&gt;
 The healthy social life is found 
 When in the mirror of each human soul 
 The whole community finds its reflection, 
 And when in the community 
 The virtue of each one is living.

[[File:Edith Maryon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|English sculptor [[Edith Maryon]] belonged to the innermost circle of founders of anthroposophy and was appointed to head the Section of Sculptural Arts at the Goetheanum.]]
Steiner designed 17 buildings, including the [[Goetheanum|First and Second Goetheanums]].&lt;ref&gt;Sokolina, Anna P. "Biology in Architecture: the Goetheanum Case Study."

His primary sculptural work is ''The Representative of Humanity'' (1922), a nine-meter high wood sculpture executed as a joint project with the sculptor [[Edith Maryon]]. This was intended to be placed in the first Goetheanum. It shows a central, free-standing Christ holding a balance between the beings of [[Lucifer]] and [[Ahriman]], representing opposing tendencies of expansion and contraction.&lt;ref&gt;''Art as Spiritual Activity: Rudolf Steiner's Contribution to the Visual Arts''.

Steiner's blackboard drawings were unique at the time and almost certainly not originally intended as art works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthromedia.net/en/themes/anthroposophy/rudolf-steiner-life-and-work/black-board-drawings/ Thought-Pictures - Rudolf Steiner’s Blackboard Drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504002748/http://www.anthromedia.net/en/themes/anthroposophy/rudolf-steiner-life-and-work/black-board-drawings/ |date=4 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Beuys]]' work, itself heavily influenced by Steiner, has led to the modern understanding of Steiner's drawings as artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Rinder, [http://antroposofi.org/blackboard/steineressay.html Rudolf Steiner: An Aesthetic Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performing arts ===
{{See also|Eurythmy}}
Steiner wrote four [[mystery plays]] between 1909 and 1913: ''The Portal of Initiation'', ''The Souls' Probation'', ''The Guardian of the Threshold'' and ''The Soul's Awakening'', modeled on the esoteric dramas of Edouard Schuré, [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] 'On Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas, Four Lectures Given in Spring Valley, 1948' {{ISBN|0-936132-93-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's plays continue to be performed by anthroposophical groups in various countries, most notably (in the original German) in Dornach, Switzerland and (in English translation) in Spring Valley, New York and in Stroud and Stourbridge in the U.K.

In collaboration with Marie von Sivers, Steiner also founded a new approach to acting, storytelling, and the recitation of poetry. His last public lecture course, given in 1924, was on speech and drama. The Russian actor, director, and acting coach [[Michael Chekhov]] based significant aspects of his method of acting on Steiner's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/viewFile/5054/5759 |title=On Rudolf Steiner's Impact on the Training of the Actor |author=Anderson, Neil |journal=Literature &amp; Aesthetics |date=June 2011 |volume=21|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Solomon, [http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf Michael Chekhov and His Approach to Acting in Contemporary Performance Training] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803154254/http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf |date=3 August 2016 }}, MA thesis University of Maine, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Marie von Sivers]], Rudolf Steiner also developed the art of [[eurythmy]], sometimes referred to as "visible speech and song". According to the principles of eurythmy, there are archetypal movements or gestures that correspond to every aspect of speech – the sounds (or [[phonemes]]), the rhythms, and the grammatical function – to every "soul quality" – joy, despair, tenderness, etc. – and to every aspect of music – tones, intervals, rhythms, and harmonies.

=== Goethean science &lt;!--linked from 'Goethean science'--&gt;===
{{See also|Goethean science}}
In his commentaries on Goethe's scientific works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in nature, rather than theory- or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886) and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach from the physical sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required to find the biological archetypes (''Urpflanze''), and postulated that Goethe had sought but been unable to fully find the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=Hemleben&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 37–49 and pp. 96–100 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the [[intermaxillary segment|intermaxillary bone]] in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; Steiner defended [[Goethe's theory of color|Goethe's qualitative description of color]] as arising synthetically from the polarity of light and darkness, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s particle-based and analytic conception.

Steiner approached the philosophical questions of [[epistemology|knowledge]] and [[Free will|freedom]] in two stages. In his dissertation, published in expanded form in 1892 as ''Truth and Knowledge'', Steiner suggests that there is an inconsistency between Kant's philosophy, which posits that all knowledge is a representation of an essential verity inaccessible to human consciousness, and modern science, which assumes that all influences can be found in the sensory and mental world to which we have access. Steiner considered Kant's philosophy of an inaccessible beyond ("Jenseits-Philosophy") a stumbling block in achieving a satisfying philosophical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Storr]], ''Feet of Clay'', Free Press-Simon and Schuster, 1996. Storr quotes Steiner p72, "If, however, we regard the sum of all percepts as the one part and contrast with this a second part, namely the things-in-themselves, then we are philosophising into the blue. We are merely playing with concepts."&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner postulates that the world is essentially an indivisible unity, but that our [[consciousness]] divides it into the [[senses|sense]]-perceptible appearance, on the one hand, and the formal nature accessible to our [[thinking]], on the other. He sees in thinking itself an element that can be strengthened and deepened sufficiently to penetrate all that our senses do not reveal to us. Steiner thus considered what appears to human experience as a division between the spiritual and natural worlds to be a conditioned result of the structure of our consciousness, which separates [[perception]] and thinking. These two faculties give us not two worlds, but two complementary views of the same world; neither has primacy and the two together are necessary and sufficient to arrive at a complete understanding of the world. In thinking about [[perception]] (the path of natural science) and perceiving the process of thinking (the path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] training), it is possible to discover a hidden inner unity between the two poles of our experience.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 4}} [[Truth]], for Steiner, is paradoxically both an objective discovery and yet "a free creation of the human spirit, that never would exist at all if we did not generate it ourselves. The task of understanding is not to replicate in conceptual form something that already exists, but rather to create a wholly new realm, that together with the world given to our senses constitutes the fullness of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Truth and Science'', Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', Steiner further explores potentials within thinking: freedom, he suggests, can only be approached gradually with the aid of the creative activity of thinking. Thinking can be a free deed; in addition, it can liberate our will from its subservience to our [[instinct]]s and [[motivation|drive]]s. Free deeds, he suggests, are those for which we are fully conscious of the motive for our action; freedom is the spiritual activity of penetrating with consciousness our own nature and that of the world,&lt;ref&gt;"To be conscious of the laws underlying one's actions is to be conscious of one's freedom. The process of knowing ... is the process of development towards freedom." Steiner, GA3, pp. 91f, quoted in Rist and Schneider, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and the real activity of acting in full consciousness.&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|133–4}} This includes overcoming influences of both heredity and environment: "To be free is to be capable of thinking one's own thoughts – not the thoughts merely of the body, or of society, but thoughts generated by one's deepest, most original, most essential and spiritual self, one's individuality."&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner affirms [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s and [[Haeckel]]'s [[evolution]]ary perspectives but extended this beyond its [[materialism|materialistic]] consequences; he sees human [[consciousness]], indeed, all human culture, as a product of natural evolution that transcends itself. For Steiner, nature becomes self-conscious in the human being. Steiner's description of the nature of human consciousness thus closely parallels that of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', {{ISBN|0-7126-7332-6}}. Cf. Solovyov: "In human beings, the absolute subject-object appears ''as such'', i.e. as pure spiritual activity, containing all of its own objectivity, the whole process of its natural manifestation, but containing it totally ideally – in consciousness....The subject knows here only its own activity as an objective activity (sub specie object). Thus, the original identity of subject and object is restored in philosophical knowledge." (''The Crisis of Western Philosophy'', Lindisfarne 1996 pp. 42–3)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritual science ===
{{See also|Anthroposophy|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}
[[File:Steiner Berlin 1900 big.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner 1900]]
In his earliest works, Steiner already spoke of the "natural and spiritual worlds" as a unity.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; From 1900 on, he began lecturing about concrete details of the spiritual world(s), culminating in the publication in 1904 of the first of several systematic presentations, his ''Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos''. As a starting point for the book Steiner took a quotation from Goethe, describing the method of natural scientific observation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/RSP1965/GA009_c01.html ''Theosophy'', Chapter I: The Essential Nature of Man]&lt;/ref&gt; while in the Preface he made clear that the line of thought taken in this book led to the same goal as that in his earlier work, ''The Philosophy of Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;''Theosophy'',
from the Prefaces to the First, Second, and Third Editions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/AP1971/GA009_c01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1903–1908 Steiner maintained the magazine "Lucifer-Gnosis" and published in it essays on topics such as initiation, reincarnation and karma, and knowledge of the supernatural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA034/ Articles from "Lucifer-Gnosis," 1903–1908]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were later collected and published as books, such as ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' (1904/5) and ''Cosmic Memory''. The book ''An Outline of Esoteric Science'' was published in 1910. Important themes include:
* the human being as body, [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]];
* the path of spiritual development;
* spiritual influences on world-evolution and history; and
* [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].

Steiner emphasized that there is an objective natural and spiritual world that can be known, and that perceptions of the spiritual world and incorporeal beings are, under conditions of training comparable to that required for the natural sciences, including self-discipline, replicable by multiple observers. It is on this basis that [[spiritual science]] is possible, with radically different epistemological foundations than those of natural science. He believed that natural science was correct in its methods but one-sided for exclusively focusing on sensory phenomena, while mysticism was vague in its methods, though seeking to explore the inner and spiritual life. Anthroposophy was meant to apply the systematic methods of the former to the content of the latter&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Christianity as Mystical Fact and the Mysteries of Antiquity'', Anthroposophic Press 2006 {{ISBN|0880104368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of Steiner's teachers, Franz Brentano, had famously declared that "The true method of philosophy can only be the method of natural science" (Walach, Harald, "Criticism of Transpersonal Psychology and Beyond", in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology, ed. H. L. Friedman and G. Hartelius. P. 45.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Steiner, the cosmos is permeated and continually transformed by the creative activity of non-physical processes and spiritual beings. For the human being to become conscious of the objective reality of these processes and beings, it is necessary to creatively enact and reenact, within, their creative activity. Thus objective spiritual knowledge always entails creative inner activity.&lt;ref name="GL"/&gt; Steiner articulated three stages of any creative deed:&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{rp|Pt II, Chapter 1}}
* Moral intuition: the ability to discover or, preferably, develop valid ethical principles;
* Moral imagination: the imaginative transformation of such principles into a concrete intention applicable to the particular situation ([[situational ethics]]); and
* Moral technique: the realization of the intended transformation, depending on a mastery of practical skills.

Steiner termed his work from this period onwards ''[[Anthroposophy]]''. He emphasized that the spiritual path he articulated builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent [[judgment]]; for the results of spiritual research to be appropriately presented in a modern context they must be in a form accessible to [[logic]]al understanding, so that those who do not have access to the spiritual experiences underlying anthroposophical research can make independent evaluations of the latter's results.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädagogik'', {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual training is to support what Steiner considered the overall purpose of human evolution, the development of the mutually interdependent qualities of love and [[free will|freedom]].&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, "Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, p. 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steiner and Christianity ===
In 1899 Steiner experienced what he described as a life-transforming inner encounter with the being of Christ; previously he had little or no relation to Christianity in any form. Then and thereafter, his relationship to Christianity remained entirely founded upon personal experience, and thus both non-denominational and strikingly different from conventional religious forms.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; Steiner was then 38, and the experience of meeting the Christ occurred after a tremendous inner struggle. To use Steiner's own words, the "experience culminated in my standing in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography, Chapters In The Course Of My Life: 18611907, Rudolf Steiner, SteinerBooks, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christ and human evolution ====
Steiner describes Christ as the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and human history, redeeming [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] from [[Paradise]].&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte, Volume 27, {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, especially Chapters 1.3, 1.4&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the Christ as a being that unifies and inspires all religions, not belonging to a particular religious faith. To be "Christian" is, for Steiner, a search for balance between polarizing extremes&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;{{rp|102–3}} and the ability to manifest love in freedom.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Central principles of his understanding include:
*The being of Christ is central to ''all'' religions, though called by different names by each.
*Every religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born.
*Historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed in our times in order to meet the ongoing evolution of humanity.

In Steiner's [[esoteric cosmology]], the spiritual development of humanity is interwoven in and inseparable from the cosmological development of the universe. Continuing the evolution that led to humanity being born out of the natural world, the Christ being brings an impulse enabling human consciousness of the forces that act creatively, but unconsciously, in nature.&lt;ref&gt;An Outline of Esoteric Science, Anthroposophic, SteinerBooks, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divergence from conventional Christian thought ====
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include gnostic elements.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; However, unlike many gnostics, Steiner affirms the unique and actual physical Incarnation of Christ in Jesus at the beginning of the Christian era.

One of the central points of divergence with conventional Christian thought is found in [[Anthroposophy#Nature of the human being|Steiner's views on reincarnation and karma]].

Steiner also posited two different Jesus children involved in the Incarnation of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; He references in this regard the fact that the [[genealogy|genealogies]] in these two gospels list twenty-six (Luke) to forty-one (Matthew) completely different ancestors for the generations from [[King David|David]] to Jesus. See [[Genealogy of Jesus]] for alternative explanations of this radical divergence.

Steiner's view of the [[second coming]] of Christ is also unusual. He suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but rather, meant that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, in the "[[Etheric plane|etheric]] realm" – i.e. visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life – for increasing numbers of people, beginning around the year 1933. He emphasized that the future would require humanity to recognize this Spirit of Love in all its genuine forms, regardless of how this is named. He also warned that the traditional name, "Christ", might be used, yet the true essence of this Being of Love ignored.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;

==== The Christian Community ====
In the 1920s, Steiner was approached by [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], a [[Lutheran]] pastor with a congregation in Berlin, who asked if it was possible to create a more modern form of Christianity. Soon others joined Rittelmeyer – mostly Protestant pastors and theology students, but including several Roman Catholic priests. Steiner offered counsel on renewing the spiritual potency of the sacraments while emphasizing [[freedom of thought]] and a personal relationship to religious life. He envisioned a new synthesis of Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious life, terming this "modern, [[John the Evangelist|Johannine Christianity]]".&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;

The resulting movement for religious renewal became known as "[[The Christian Community]]". Its work is based on a free relationship to the Christ, without dogma or policies. Its priesthood, which is open to both men and women, is free to preach out of their own spiritual insights and creativity.

Steiner emphasized that the resulting movement for the renewal of Christianity was a personal gesture of help to a movement founded by Rittelmeyer and others independently of his anthroposophical work.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; The distinction was important to Steiner because he sought with Anthroposophy to create a scientific, not [[faith]]-based, spirituality.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; He recognized that for those who wished to find more traditional forms, however, a renewal of the traditional religions was also a vital need of the times.

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has said of Steiner that "Some of his ideas on education – such as educating the handicapped in the mainstream – are worth considering, although his overall plan for developing the spirit and the soul rather than the intellect cannot be admired".&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepdic.com/steiner.html| title= The Skeptic's Dictionary: Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925)|date=12 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2010| author=[[Robert Todd Carroll]]| work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's translators have pointed out that his use of ''Geist'' includes both mind and spirit, however,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Amrine and Konrad Oberhuber (trans.), in Rudolf Steiner, ''The Boundaries of Natural Science'', Spring Valley, NY: Anthroposophic Press. {{ISBN|0-88010-018-4}}. p. 125, fn. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as the German term ''Geist'' can be translated equally properly in either way.&lt;ref&gt;J.

=== Scientism ===
{{see also|Anthroposophy#Scientific_basis|l1=Anthroposophy: Scientific basis}}
[[Olav Hammer]] has criticized as [[scientism]] Steiner's claim to use scientific methodology to investigate spiritual phenomena that were based upon his claims of [[clairvoyant]] experience.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; Steiner regarded the observations of spiritual research as more dependable (and above all, consistent) than observations of physical reality. However, he did consider spiritual research to be fallible&lt;ref name=Zander2/&gt;{{rp|p. 618}} and held the view that anyone capable of thinking logically was in a position to correct errors by spiritual researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner: "It may even happen that a researcher who has the power of perception in supersensible realms may fall into error in his logical presentation, and that someone who has no supersensible perception, but who has the capacity for sound thinking, may correct him."[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_c04-01.html Occult Science, Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity===
&lt;!-- this section is linked from [[Waldorf education]]--&gt; 
Steiner's work includes both universalist, humanist elements and historically influenced racial assumptions.&lt;ref name=Staud&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Staudenmaier|title=Race and Redemption|journal=Nova Religio|publisher=University of California Press|date=February 2008|pages=4ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the contrast and even contradictions between these elements, "whether a given reader interprets Anthroposophy as racist or not depends upon that reader's concerns".&lt;ref name=Zander&gt;"Es hängt dabei von den Interessen der Leser ab, ob die Anthroposophie rassistisch interpretiert wird oder nicht." Helmut Zander, "Sozialdarwinistische Rassentheorien aus dem okkulten Untergrund des Kaiserreichs", in Puschner et al., Handbuch zur "Völkischen Bewegung" 1871–1918: 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner considered that by dint of its shared language and culture, each people has a unique essence, which he called its soul or spirit.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; He saw race as a physical manifestation of humanity's spiritual evolution, and at times discussed race in terms of complex hierarchies that were largely derived from 19th century biology, anthropology, philosophy and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. However, he consistently and explicitly subordinated race, ethnicity, gender, and indeed all hereditary factors, to individual factors in development.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; For Steiner, human individuality is centered in a person's unique biography, and he believed that an individual's experiences and development are not bound by a single lifetime or the qualities of the physical body.&lt;ref name=Ravagli&gt;Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Zanders Erzählungen'', Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8305-1613-2}}, pp. 184f&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically:

* Steiner occasionally characterized specific [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s, nations and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] in ways that have been termed [[racism|racist]] by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Frank, "Einschüchterung auf Waldorf-Art", ''Die Tageszeitung'' 4 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes descriptions by him of certain races and ethnic groups as flowering, others as backward, or destined to degenerate or disappear.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; He presented explicitly hierarchical views of the spiritual evolution of different races,&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Treitel, ''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern'', Johns Hopkins Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-7812-8}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; including—at times, and inconsistently—portraying the [[white race]], [[European culture]] or Germanic culture as representing the high point of human [[evolution]] as of the early 20th century, although he did describe them as destined to be superseded by future cultures.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;
* Throughout his life Steiner consistently emphasized the core spiritual unity of all the world's peoples and sharply criticized racial prejudice. He articulated beliefs that the individual nature of any person stands higher than any racial, ethnic, national or religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;&lt;!--CL, p.55--&gt; His belief that race and [[ethnicity]] are transient and superficial, and not essential aspects of the individual,&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; was partly rooted in his conviction that each individual [[reincarnation|reincarnates]] in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives, and that each of us thus bears within him or herself the heritage of many races and peoples.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Blume, "Joseph Beuys". In Kugler and Baur, ''Rudolf Steiner in Kunst und Architektur'', {{ISBN|3-8321-9012-0}}, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his life, Steiner predicted that race will rapidly lose any remaining significance for future generations.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt; In Steiner's view, culture is universal, and explicitly not ethnically based; he saw Goethe and [[German idealism|idealist philosophy]] in particular as the source of ideas that could be drawn upon by any culture, and he vehemently criticized imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Myers, "Colonial consciousness: Rudolf Steiner's Orientalism and German Cultural Identity", ''Journal of European Studies'' 36(4): 387–417&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of his ethical individualism, Steiner considered "race, folk, ethnicity and gender" to be general, describable categories into which individuals may choose to fit, but from which free human beings can and will liberate themselves.&lt;ref name=Ravagli/&gt;

==== Judaism ====
During the years when Steiner was best known as a literary critic, he published a series of articles attacking various manifestations of [[antisemitism]]&lt;ref&gt;''Mitteilungen aus dem Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitismus'', '''11'''(37):307-8, 11 September 1901. [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/abwehr/Blatt_bsb00000905,00315.html Article]. ''Mitteilungen'', '''11'''(38):316, 18 September 1901. [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/abwehr/Blatt_bsb00000905,00324.html Article]. Cf. GA31 for a complete list and text of articles.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticizing some of the most prominent anti-Semites of the time as "barbaric" and "enemies of culture".&lt;ref name=HuH&gt;[http://db.swr.de/upload/manuskriptdienst/wissen/wi20041122_2812.rtf "Hammer und Hakenkreuz – Anthroposophie im Visier der völkischen Bewegung"], ''Südwestrundfunk'', 26 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On a number of occasions, however, Steiner suggested that Jewish cultural and social life had lost all contemporary relevance&lt;ref&gt;Thesenpapier von Dr. Jan Badewien zur Veranstaltung: Antijudaismus bei Rudolf Steiner?, [http://groups.uni-paderborn.de/berufspaedagogik/lehrstuhl/forum-thesen-badewien.html Universität Paderborn], 23.01.02.&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted full [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] of the Jewish people into the nations in which they lived. This stance has come under severe criticism in recent years.&lt;ref name=Zander/&gt;

Steiner was a critic of his contemporary [[Theodor Herzl]]'s goal of a [[Zionism|Zionist]] state, and indeed of any ethnically determined state, as he considered ethnicity to be an outmoded basis for social life and civic identity.&lt;ref&gt;"The need to overcome nationalism was one of the central themes of [Steiner's] social agenda": Hans-Jürgen Bracker, "The individual and the unity of humankind". in ''Judaism and Anthroposophy'', ed. Fred Paddock and Mado Spiegler. Anthroposophic Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0880105100}}. p. 100. See also "Humanistischer Zionismus", in Novalis 5 (1997): "Steiner generell die allmähliche Überwindung und Auflösung von Stammes-, Volks-, Nationen- und »Rasse«-grenzen vertrat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of Steiner's life and after his death, there were massive defamatory press attacks mounted on him by early [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] leaders (including [[Adolf Hitler]]) and other right-wing nationalists. These criticized Steiner's thought and [[anthroposophy]] as being incompatible with National Socialist racial ideology, and charged him of being influenced by his close connections with Jews and even that he himself was Jewish.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuH/&gt;

It also serves as reference for other Southern Ocean and Antarctic monitoring programs.  

Several countries collaborate in the survey providing vessels to tow [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]]s (CPRs) in a near circum-[[Antarctic]] survey.  Tows conducted between [[Hobart]] and the French Antarctic station Dumont d’Urville are also conducted in collaboration with the [http://www.imos.org.au/ IMOS][[Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey]].  The SO-CPR Survey is supported by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081121162055/http://www.marine.gov.uk/scar.htm Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research] and its Expert Group on Continuous Plankton Research, which helps promote and develop the survey.  

The CPRs are towed from research and supply vessels.  The CPR is towed at about 10 metres below the surface and for about 450 nautical miles (830&amp;nbsp;km) per tow. The plankton enters a small opening in the device and is trapped and preserved between two layers of silk mesh.  These vessels also collect at the same time underway data such as [[sea surface temperature]], [[salinity]], [[fluorometry]], light and other oceanographic-meteorological parameters.  All plankton in five nautical mile (9&amp;nbsp;km) equivalent sections are identified to the lowest possible taxa, usually species and counted.  [[Antarctic krill]] and other [[euphausiids]] are identified to developmental stage.  Plankton counts are combined with averaged environmental data for each {{convert|5|nmi|km|adj=on}}.  

[[Image:SCARCPRSurvey a GHosie AAD.JPG|thumb|Preparing the CPR on board TS Umitaka Maru (Graham Hosie AAD)]] Approximately 40-50 tows are made each year.  More than 80 tows were completed in 2007-08 [http://www.ipy.org/ International Polar Year] in support of the [http://www.caml.aq/ Census of Antarctic Marine Life].  {{convert|135000|nmi|km}} of data have been collected since 1991, producing more than 27,000 samples for 200+ taxa coupled with environmental data.  Most data comes from the October to April period.  Few ships operate in the region during winter but some winter tows south of Australia have been made.  

Use of the SO-CPR data for research purposes is encouraged.  Data are made available soon after the CPR samples are processed.  Data are held at the [http://data.aad.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Data Centre] and at the [http://www.scarmarbin.be/ SCAR Marine Biodiversity Information Network].

'''''Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary''''' is an oil painting by [[Paul Delaroche]] which was investigated in 2016 by the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''

==Lost work==
An oil painting of Saint Amelia by history painter Paul Delaroche was commissioned in 1831 by [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Queen Marie-Amélie of France]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/830070/saint-amelie-queen-of-hungary|title=Raunheim, Hermann (1817-1895) - Saint Amélie, Queen of Hungary|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as a design for a stained glass window in the Queen's private chapel at the [[Château d'Eu]]. The work was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon of 1834]]. In 1837 the painting was recorded as being hung in the Royal Chapel at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris, and was copied in an engraving by Paolo Mercuri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/830069/sainte-amelie-queen-of-hungary|title=Mercuri, Paolo (1804-1884) - Sainte Amélie, Queen of Hungary |website=www.royalcollection.org.uk |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preparatory drawing, in [[chalk]], [[graphite]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] is held by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=719921&amp;partId=1&amp;people=127343&amp;peoA=127343-2-9&amp;page=1|title=drawing|website=British Museum|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting was believed to be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul Delaroche: History Painted|page=165|year=1997|first=Stephen|last=Bann|authorlink=Stephen Bann|publisher=Reaktian Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fake or Fortune?''==
The ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' team investigated a version of the painting, housed at Castle of Park in [[Cornhill, Aberdeenshire]], to determine whether it was the Delaroche original or one of a number of copies. This unsigned version of the painting, was bought in 1989, for about £500, by art dealer the late Neil Wilson, who worked for [[Christie's]] after leaving university. The painting's [[provenance]] was very poor. In the programme, art expert [[Bendor Grosvenor]] showed an 1866 watercolour by [[Joseph Nash]] depicting the painting in the Queen's bedroom at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont House]] in [[Surrey]], where the King and Queen lived after fleeing France following the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]]. After that, the next sighting of the work was when it was sold at Christie's in 1980 as a work by the French artist [[Fleury François Richard]], with the title 'A Queen and her Retinue at Worship'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grosvenor|first1=Bendor| authorlink=Bendor Grosvenor |title='Fake or Fortune?' does Delaroche |url=http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/4051_Fake_or_Fortune_does_Delaroche |accessdate=10 July 2017 |work=Art History News|date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical analysis showed that colour anomalies in the painting were the result of pigment degradation, and that parts of the painting had also been restored. After reviewing the show's findings, [[Stephen Bann|Professor Stephen Bann]], a leading Delaroche expert, concluded that it was the lost original. He also revealed a letter written by Delaroche, in which registers his dismay at the state of the picture after it had been copied to create a [[stained glass]] window for Queen Marie-Amélie, and says that he will have to do considerable work to restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muñoz-Alonso|first1=Lorena|title=Long-Lost Panting by French Master Paul Delaroche Authenticated on TV Show|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/lost-panting-delaroche-surfaces-tv-show-573941|accessdate=10 July 2017|work=artnet News|publisher=Artnet Worldwide Corporation|date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its authentication, Wilson's widow, Becky, was reported to have decided to keep the painting, but allow it to be displayed at the [[British Museum]] in London when a Delaroche exhibition takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Peter|title=Late North-East Art Dealer’s £500 Artwork Revealed to be Rare Masterpiece|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/late-n-east-art-dealers-500-artwork-revealed-to-be-rare-masterpiece1/|accessdate=10 July 2017|work=Evening Express (Aberdeen)|date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shekel function''' is a multidimensional, multimodal, continuous, deterministic [[function (mathematics)|function]] commonly used as a test function for testing [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques.

The mathematical form of a function in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; maxima is:

&lt;math&gt;
f(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \; \left( c_{i} + \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n} (x_{j} - a_{ji})^2 \right)^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

or, similarly,

&lt;math&gt;
f(x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1},x_n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \; \left( c_{i} + \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n} (x_{j} - a_{ij})^2 \right)^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Spinmechatronics''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|p|ɪ|n|əm|ɛ|k|ə|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|n|ɪ|k|s}} is [[neologism]] referring to an emerging field of research concerned with the exploitation of [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent phenomena and established [[spintronic]] methodologies and technologies in conjunction with electro-mechanical, magno-mechanical, acousto-mechanical and opto-mechanical systems. Most especially, spinmechatronics (or spin mechatronics) concerns the integration of [[micro-]] and [[nano-]] [[mechatronic]] systems with [[spin (physics)|spin]] physics and [[spintronics]].

==History and origins==
While spinmechatronics has been recognised only recently &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spinmechatronics.org&lt;/ref&gt; (2008) as an independent field, hybrid [[spin (physics)|spin]]-mechanical system development dates back to the early nineteen-nineties,&lt;ref name="A Sidles 1991"&gt;J A Sidles, Noninductive detection of single-proton magnetic resonance. Appl. Phys. Lett., 58(24):2854 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; with devices combining [[spintronics]] and [[micromechanics]] emerging at the turn of the twenty-first century.

One of the longest established spinmechatronic systems is the [[Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope]] or MRFM. First proposed by J. A. Sidles in a seminal paper of 1991 &lt;ref name="A Sidles 1991"/&gt; – and since extensively developed both theoretically and experimentally by a number of international research groups&lt;ref&gt;D Rugar et al., Single spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy. Nature, 430, 329 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G de Loubens et al., Magnetic resonance studies of the fundamental spin-wave modes in individual submicron Cu/NiFe/Cu perpendicularly magnetized disks. Phys. Rev. Lett., 98 (12), 127601 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[MRFM]] operates by coupling a magnetically loaded [[micro-]]mechanical cantilever to an excited nuclear, [[proton]] or [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] system. The [[MRFM]] concept effectively combines scanning atomic force microscopy ([[Atomic force microscope|AFM]]) with [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] to provide a spectroscopic tool of unparalleled sensitivity. [[Nanometre]] resolution is possible, and the technique potentially forms the basis for ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-high resolution magnetic, biochemical, biomedical, and clinical diagnostics.

The synergy of micromechanics and established [[Spintronics|spintronic]] technologies for sensing applications is one of the most significant spinmechatronic developments of the last decade. At the beginning of this century, [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] sensors incorporating [[Magnetoresistance|magnetoresistive]] technologies emerged &lt;ref&gt;M Löhndorf et al., Highly sensitive strain sensors based on magnetic tunnelling junctions. Appl. Phys. Lett.,  81 (2), 313 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and a wide range of devices exploiting similar principles are likely to realize research and commercial potential by 2015.

Contemporary innovation in spinmechatronics drives forward the independent advancement of cutting-edge science in [[spin (physics)|spin physics]], [[spintronics]] and [[micro-]] and [[nano-]][[mechatronics]] and catalyses the development of wholly new instrumentation, [[Control engineering|control]] and fabrication techniques to facilitate and exploit their integration.

==Key constitutive technologies==

===Micro- and nano- mechatronics===
[[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]: [[micro-]][[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] systems are the key ingredient of [[micro-]][[mechatronics]]. Micro-electromechanical systems are – as the name suggests – devices with significant dimensions in the micrometre regime or less.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memsnet.org/mems/what-is.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jwnc.gla.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Highly suited to integration with electronic and microwave circuitry, they provide the key to electro-mechanical functionalities unachievable with [[Classical physics|classical]] precision [[mechatronics]]. Commercialisation of mass-produced [[Microelectromechanical systems]] products is rapidly picking up pace and includes printer ink-jet technology, 3D [[accelerometer]]s, integrated pressure sensors, and [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) displays. At the cutting edge of [[Microelectromechanical systems]] fabrication and integration technologies are [[nano-]] [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] systems&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/293&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]]). Typical examples are micrometres long, tens of [[nanometre]]s thick, and have mechanical resonance frequencies approaching 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. Their small physical dimensions and mass (of order [[pico-]][[gram]]s) makes them highly sensitive to changes in [[stiffness]]; this, their synergy with mechanical and data processing systems, and the option of attaching chemical/ biological molecules, makes them ideal for ultra high-performance mechanical, chemical and biological sensing applications.

===Spin physics===
Spin physics is a broad and active area of [[condensed-matter physics]] research. ‘[[Spin (physics)|Spin]]’ in this context refers to a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] property of certain [[elementary particle]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and should not be confused with the [[Classical mechanics|classical]] (and better-known) concept of [[rotation]]. Spin physics spans studies of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]], [[electron]] and [[proton]] [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], [[magnetism]], and certain areas of optics. [[Spintronics]] is a branch of spin physics. Perhaps the two best known applications of spin physics are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) and the spintronic giant-magnetoresistive ([[GMR (physics)|GMR]]) [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] read head.

===Spintronics===
Spintronic [[magnetoresistance]] is a major scientific and commercial success story. Today, most families own a spintronic device: the giant-magnetoresistive ([[GMR (physics)|GMR]]) [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] read head in their computer. The science that gave rise to this phenomenal business opportunity – and earned the 2007 [[Nobel Prize]] for Physics – was the recognition that electrical carriers are characterized by both [[Electric charge|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref&gt;M N Baibich et al., Giant magnetoresistance of (001)Fe/(001)Cr magnetic superlattices. Phys. Rev. Lett., 61, 2472 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/press.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/phyadv07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|tunnelling-magnetoresistance]] (TMR) – which uses the electron spin as a label to allow or forbid [[electron]] [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]]&lt;ref&gt;J S Moodera et al., Large magnetoresistance at room temperature in ferromagnetic thin film tunnel junctions. Phys. Rev. Lett., 74 (16), 3273 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; – dominates the hard disk market and is rapidly establishing itself in areas as diverse as magnetic logic devices and biosensors.&lt;ref&gt;J Schotter et al., A Biochip based on magnetoresistive sensors. IEEE Trans. Magn., 38, 5, 3365 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing development is pushing the frontiers of TMR devices towards the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12751">'''Survival radios''' are carried by ships and aircraft to facilitate rescue in an emergency. They are generally designed to transmit on [[international distress frequency|international distress frequencies]]. Maritime systems have been standardized under the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]].

==History==
The use of radio to aid in rescuing survivors of accidents at sea came to the forefront after the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912. Lifeboats were equipped with [[spark gap transmitter]]s such as the [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] Type 241, c. 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/marconi/collection/catalogue.php?invnum=59677&amp;mode=documents|title=MHS - Marconi Collection - Catalogue inventory number 59677|first=Elizabeth|last=Bruton|website=www.mhs.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shawsavillships.co.uk/radios/241.htm]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These operated using [[Morse code]] on [[500 kHz]], the international distress frequency at the time. This frequency had the advantage of long range due to ground-wave propagation and was constantly monitored by all large ships at sea after the'' Titanic'''s sinking. However, due to its wavelength of 600 meters, a long antenna was required to achieve good range. Long wires on the order of 1/4 wavelength held up by kites or balloons were often used. Spark-gap continued to be used in lifeboats long after the technology was banned for general communication.

===The Gibson Girl===
[[File:GibsonGirlSurvivalRadio.agr.jpg|thumb|BC-778 "Gibson Girl" radio transmitter.]]
During World War II, Germany developed a hand-crank 500&amp;nbsp;kHz rescue radio, the "Notsender" (emergency transmitter) NS2. It used two [[vacuum tube]]s and was [[Crystal oscillator|crystal-controlled]]. The radio case curved inward in the middle so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the thighs, while the generator handle was turned.  The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. [[United States Army Air Forces]] aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Named the ''[[Gibson Girl]]'' because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame [[box kite]], and a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the flying line was the aerial wire. Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was [[500 kHz]] at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of {{convert|200|mi|km nmi|-2}}. Keying could be automatic [[SOS]], or manual. Crystals were a scarce item for the U.S. during the war and the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled.

A post-World War II version, the AN/CRT-3, which added a frequency in the 8&amp;nbsp;MHz range, was in use by ships and civil aircraft until the mid 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wftw.nl/gibsongirl/gibsongirl.html|title=Wireless for the Warrior. Gibson Girl|website=wftw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VHF era===
The use of aircraft for [[search and rescue]] in World War II brought line-of-sight [[Very high frequency|VHF]] radios into use. The much shorter wavelengths of VHF allowed a simple [[dipole antenna|dipole]] or [[whip antenna]] to be effective. Early devices included the British Walter, a compact single vacuum tube oscillator design operating at 177&amp;nbsp;MHz (1.7 meter wavelength), and the German Jäger (NS-4), a two-tube master oscillator power amplifier&lt;ref&gt;A vacuum tube "master oscillator power amplifier" radio design combines the functions of an oscillator and amplifier in the same tube or tubes to reduce parts count, weight and power consumption, and improve reliability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Do not link to "master oscillator power amplifier", as that redirects to an article uses the term in a completely unrelated context involving lasers. --&gt; design at 58.5 and, later, 42&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wftw.nl/gibsongirl/gibsongirl2.html|title=Wireless for the Warrior. Gibson Girl|website=wftw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were small enough to include in life rafts used on single-seat fighter aircraft.

Post-war designs included the British Search And Rescue And Homing beacon (SARAH) beacon made by [[Ultra Electronics]], used in the location and recovery of astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] after his [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] space flight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msquair.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/results-of-the-first-manned-sub-orbital-space-flight.pdf |title=Results |date=2011 |website=msquair.files.wordpress.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. AN/URC-4 and the Soviet R 855U. These operated on the [[aircraft emergency frequency|aircraft emergency frequencies]] of 121.5 and 243&amp;nbsp;MHz (2.5 and 1.2 meter wavelengths).

===Automated beacon systems===

After a light plane with [[Hale Boggs|two U.S. congressmen]] on board went down in 1972 and could not be found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Boggs.htm|title=Hale Boggs - Missing in Alaska|website=www.check-six.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. began requiring all aircraft to carry an [[Emergency Locator Transmitter]] (ELT) that would turn on automatically in the event of a crash. Initially these units sent [[Electric beacon|beacon]] signals on the 121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz aircraft emergency frequency. These are being phased out in favor of [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|ELTs]] that use a 406.025&amp;nbsp;MHz signal, which can be picked up by the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] international satellite system for search and rescue. Each 406&amp;nbsp;MHz beacon has a unique digital ID code. Users are required to register the code with the Cospas-Sarsat, allowing inquiries to be made when a distress signal is picked up.  Some advanced models can transmit a location derived from an internal [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]] receiver. Maritime practice has shifted from rescue radios on 500&amp;nbsp;kHz distress frequency (which is no longer officially monitored) to the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]], which includes use of the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] system and other measures, including [[Search and Rescue Transponder|radar transponder]]s and hand-held [[marine VHF radio]]s.

There are many other types of [[emergency locator beacon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that do not use the 406 MHz Cospas-Sarsat system, including man-overboard beacons that transmit [[Automatic identification system]] beacons and [[Avalanche transceiver]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

==U.S. Military survival radios==
Military organizations still issue pilots and other combat personnel individual survival radios, which have become increasingly sophisticated, with built-in [[Distance Measuring Equipment]] (DME), [[Global Positioning Satellite]] receivers, and satellite communication. In slang terms "PRC" radios were called a "prick" followed by the model number, "Prick-25," and "URC" radios were called an "erk." United States military survival radios include:

The '''Swanwick Writers' Summer School''' is an annual writers' conference held at The [[Hayes Conference Centre]], near Swanwick, Derbyshire. Founded in 1948, and first held in the summer of 1949, it is believed to be the oldest independent writers' school in the world. Established as a charity and run on a not for profit basis, it was inspired by the London Writers Circle. Early celebrities that featured at the School  included, [[Vera Brittain]], [[L.P. Hartley]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]&lt;ref name="Hilliard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilliard|first=Christopher|title=To Exercise Our Talents: The Democratization of Writing in Britain|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Victor|title=The Fellowship of Swanwick|date=October 1949|publisher=Writer Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first chairman was [[Cecil Hunt]], a chairman of the London Writers' Circle. Early delegates included the booker prize nominee, [[Barbara Pym]], one of whose novels, ''No Fond Return of Love'', is inspired, in part, by Swanwick itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pym|first=Barbara|title=No Fond Return of Love|date=2002|publisher=Moyer Bell|location=Wickford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cocking|first=Yvonne|title=A Thankless Task?|journal=Paper to The Barbara Pym North American Conference|date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the school for over fifteen years as member, host and lecturer was Booker Prize Winner [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]]. He refers to the role Swanwick plays  in creative writing in his published essays.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Paul|title=My appointment with the muse|date=1986|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0434626007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Paul|title=On writing and the novel - essays|date=1987|publisher=Morrow|isbn=0688069096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years Swanwick has played an important role in the social development of creative writing.&lt;ref name="Wandor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wandor|first=Micheline|title=The Author Is Not Dead, Merely Somewhere Else: Creative Writing After Theory,|date=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Nancy|title=Venture of Faith - A History of Swanwick|date=1983|publisher=H.E.

Established postwar, it formed part of the continuing process of democratization of writing begun by many amateur groups in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Hilliard"/&gt; From its founding in 1948, the aim of the school has been to provide a social and educational framework for the development of creative writing skills.&lt;ref name="Wandor"/&gt; Its role in the establishment of creative writing in the UK has meant that it has been a platform for eminent speakers, from [[Hammond Innes]] in 1952 to Sir [[Terry Pratchett]].&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; It has also been closely associated with the development of women's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Sylvia|title=The Woman Writer: The History of the Society of Women Writers and Journalists|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members range from seasoned authors with numerous published books to those new to writing. The inclusive community is designed to enable the sharing of experiences, best practice and support for individual writers' creative writing.

[[Derbyshire Record Office]] houses the school's historical records, reflecting its importance in the development of creative writing in the UK. These archives (ref: D5886) include the school minutes; comment books and correspondence.

== Authors ==

Noted authors who have been members of the school over the years include [[Eleanor Hibbert|Eleanor Burford]], [[John Boland (author)|John Boland]], [[Barbara Pym]], [[Vivian Stuart]], [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]], [[Nina Bawden]], [[Carla Lane]] and [[Margaret Drabble]].&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

== Topwrite ==

In 2005, the School obtained a grant from [[Big Lottery Fund|Awards for All]] to launch the TopWrite project to support young writers and help close the gaps between the commercial, literary and academic writing worlds.

Brock]] - second edition 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist in Syriac studies is known as a '''Syriacist'''. Specifically, British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by this designation, at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

At universities Syriac studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], [[Aramaic studies]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Leiden]], [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. [[Aramaic studies]] (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Orientalia christiana periodica - Volume 74 - Page 564 Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 2008 "(a question those of us in Syriac studies are too often asked). Then, posing the question, why study Syriac, he situates the field within the broader academy. While most students learn Syriac within a biblical studies program, Syriac also impacts ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences for Syriac studies include the Symposium Syriacum,&lt;ref&gt;VI Symposium Syriacum 1992: University of Cambridge 1994 Page 14 "René Lavenant, Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 1994 "must have felt in 1892: Syriac studies were very much alive then — however restricted the number of scholars working in the field at the time; Syriac studies are even more alive today — as the large registration at this conference ..."&lt;/ref&gt; the Section "Bible and Syriac Studies in Context" at the International Meetings of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]],&lt;ref name=sbl1&gt;http://www.sbl-site.org/meetings/Congresses_CallForPaperDetails.aspx?MeetingId=22&amp;VolunteerUnitId=594&lt;/ref&gt; and the Section "Syriac Literature and Interpretations of Sacred Texts" at the Annual Meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature.&lt;ref name=sbl1/&gt;  

Syriac academic journals include the annual ''Oriens Christianus'' ([[Wiesbaden]]) and ''Syriac Studies Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern churches review - Volume 1 - Page 370 1966 "... assisted by periodicals devoted to Christian oriental studies; the most important for Syriac studies are the annual Oriens Christianus (Wiesbaden) and 370 Syriac Studies Today by Robert Murray, SJ."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trapped key interlock switchgear door.JPG|thumb|This is a trapped key interlock on the door of an electrical switchgear cabinet. It is attached with one-way security screws to discourage casual removal, which would defeat the interlock scheme.]]
 
'''Trapped key interlocking''' utilizes [[Lock (security device)|lock]]s and [[key (lock)|key]]s for sequential control of equipment and machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting.

A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.

Trapped key interlocks were used in the [[French railway system]] in the 1890s to control track switching operations. French inventor was Mr Bourré. His original company is now known as STI, Serv Trayvou Interverrouillage SA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servtrayvou.comm/ S.T.I.]&lt;/ref&gt;. Later on,  the Englishman James Harry Castell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castell.com/ Castell]&lt;/ref&gt; (1880-1953), Frenchman, B. Trayvou&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servtrayvou.comm/ S.T.I.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the American R. L. Kirk &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkkey.com/|title=Kirk|website=KirkKey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed trapped key interlocking systems, and such systems are often referred to as '''Castell''' or '''Bourre Keys''' or '''Trayvou keys''' or '''Kirk key''' interlock systems. Both worked in the [[Electricity generation|power generation]] and distribution industries in the early part of the 20th century, and both pioneered the use of trapped key interlock for switchgear control. Trapped key interlocks can be found in many industrial settings including electrical utilities, railway, petroleum, and chemical plants as a response to [[occupational safety and health]] legislation.

==Interlock devices==
A typical trapped-key interlock device consists of a lock cylinder which operates a sliding bolt through a cam.  The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock.  Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.

Some complex sequences use key exchange blocks or boxes, that allow alternative sequences of operation.
Interlock devices may have an electrical solenoid which holds the key until an electrical circuit is interrupted; for example, the power supply for a high-voltage cabinet has been de-energized, releasing a key to allow access to the interior of the cabinet. Some interlocks include a time delay function or a rotation detector to ensure a machine has had time to come to a stop before allowing the next step of an interlock sequence to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Macdonald|title=Practical Machinery Safety|publisher=Newnes|date=2004|isbn=0750662700|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key exchange block may only hold and release keys and may not have a bolt to interlock process equipment, or may be part of the interlock of a particular machine or device. 
	
[[File:Trapped key interlock transfer block.JPG|thumb|This is a transfer block, part of a trapped key interlock system. It does not have a bolt to stop operation of a device, but holds and releases other keys.]]

Manufacturers of trapped key interlock devices provide application guides showing typical interlock problems and recommended arrangements. Since the reliability and safety of the scheme critically depends on the possession of keys, duplicate keys must be carefully controlled to prevent any possibility of an unsafe operating sequence. For example, a lost key might be replaced only by a duplicate held off-site, or might require ordering a replacement from the original manufacturer.

==Example==
For example, to prevent access to the inside of an electric [[kiln]] while it is operating, a trapped key system may be used to interlock a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. Whenever the kiln power switch is turned on, the key is automatically held by the interlock, and cannot be manually removed. In order to open the kiln door, the power switch must first be turned off, which releases the key and allows it to be removed from the interlock. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the power switch from being turned on. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the power switch interlock.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Fraser, ''The electric kiln: a user's manual'' 2nd edition, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000, page 41&lt;/ref&gt; A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17439">[[File:Small Forest Gap.JPG|thumb|Treefall Gap]]

A '''treefall gap''' is a distinguishable hole in a [[forest]] with vertical sides extending through all levels down to an average height of {{cvt|2|m|ft}} above ground.&lt;ref name="brokaw"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brokaw |first=N. |year=1982 |title=The Definition of Treefall Gap and Its Effect on Measures of Forest Dynamics |work=Biotropica |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=158-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; These holes occur as result of a fallen tree or large limb. The [[ecologist]] who developed this definition used two meters because believed that "a regrowth height of 2 m was sufficient" for a gap to be considered closed, but not all scientists agreed.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; For example, Runkle believed that regrowth should be {{cvt|10–20|m|ft}} above the ground.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; Alternatively, a treefall gap as "the smallest gap [that must] be readily distinguishable amid the complexity of forest structure."&lt;ref name="brokaw" /&gt;

There is no upper limit in gap size. However, it must be caused by a tree or a large limb.&lt;ref name="brokaw" /&gt; For example, a field would not be considered a treefall gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jansen |first=D. H. |year=1990 |title=An abandoned field is not a tree fall gap |publisher=Vida Silvestre Neotropical |volume=2 |pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree falls are commonly caused by old age, [[natural hazard]]s, or [[parasitic plant]]s (e.g. certain [[epiphyte]]s).

== Measurement ==
Scientists have not been able to come to a conclusion on one absolute method for measuring a treefall gap. However, there are two types of measurements that are commonly used:

;Two-dimensional
This method does not necessarily take into account irregularity in gap shapes.&lt;ref name="sman"&gt;Schliemann, S., &amp; Bockheim, J. (2011). Methods For Studying Treefall Gaps: A Review. Forest Ecology and Management,2011,1143-1151.&lt;/ref&gt; Most gaps do not conform to one particular shape or another, so assumptions must be made.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; Gaps that are uniformly shaped (e.g. ellipse, triangle, etc.) can be quantified by measuring the length and width of each gap.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; Commonly, however, the gap is irregularly (i.e. not uniform) shaped and must be divided into smaller sections to be measured individually in order to obtain higher accuracy.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt;

;Three-dimensional
This method provides a more accurate measurement as it takes into account differences in structure of the gap descending from the canopy to the forest floor.&lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; One of the most recent strategies, pioneered by K. and S.I. Yamamoto, "utilized two photographs of the canopy gap, taken at different heights, and a series of geometric calculations to calculate the gap area." &lt;ref name="sman" /&gt; By doing this, the scientists were able to obtain a more accurate measurement as they are now accounting for differences in structure around the periphery of the gap.

== Gap regeneration ==

=== Length of gap-phase regeneration ===
Recovery time can be rapid (5–7 meters per year) or much slower depending upon the vegetation present in the gap.&lt;ref name="carson"&gt;Carson, W., Mascaro, J., &amp; Schnitzer, S. (2008). TREEFALL GAPS AND THE MAINTENANCE OF PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY IN TROPICAL FORESTS (CHAPTER 12). In Tropical forest community ecology. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Some vegetation can impede growth (see Alternative Pathway of Regeneration below). Gap-phase regeneration is not completed until the intact canopy’s height is met by new growth.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;

=== Common regeneration of pathways ===
# Seed: soil contains a number of seeds ([[seed bank]]) that are ready to sprout once they receive sunlight as a result of the gap formed in the canopy.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;
# Advanced regeneration: young plants that were originally present prior to the tree fall will quickly grow after being exposed to additional sunlight.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;
# Vegetative reproduction: As the tree falls, it will pull other vegetation with it that can begin to reproduce within the newly formed gap.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; This is especially true for [[Liana]]s (see Alternative Pathway of Regeneration below).
# Spreading laterally into the gap from the surrounding forest.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;

=== Alternative pathway of regeneration ===
[[Lianas]] are a common woody vine found in tropical forests. These vines utilize trees to venture into the canopy in search of sunlight and nutrients. Thus, when a tree falls, it brings all the Liana growth with it. Following a tree fall, Lianas have a high survival rate (~90%) and they can quickly begin sprouting.&lt;ref name="schnitzer"&gt;Schnitzer, S., Dalling, J., &amp; Carson, W. (2000). The impact of lianas on tree regeneration in tropical forest canopy gaps: Evidence for an alternative pathway of gap-phase regeneration.Journal of Ecology, 88(4), 655-666.&lt;/ref&gt; This causes potential problems as new trees begin to grow but are unable or are limited by the presence of Lianas. Many gaps have been found to enter a state where growth has been halted due to Lianas. Therefore, scientists have begun looking into their effects on gap regeneration. A study conducted on [[Barro Colorado Island]] found that lianas play a likely role in slowing gap-regeneration time.&lt;ref name="schnitzer" /&gt; Lianas have been able to keep a gap in a low-canopy state, and this is especially true for gaps that are thirteen plus years old.&lt;ref name="schnitzer" /&gt; Further studies by Schnitzer et al. have shown that as Lianas increase in density, species richness and [[Pioneer species|pioneer tree]] density decrease for all gaps (i.e. low and high canopy gaps).&lt;ref name="schnitzer" /&gt; This data suggests that Lianas play a significant role in gap-regeneration time.

== Intermediate disturbance hypothesis and species abundance ==
Treefall gaps are important in maintenance of some plant species diversity.  Disturbance is important in tropics as a mechanism for maintaining diversity. According to the [[intermediate disturbance hypothesis]] (IDH), some disturbance is critical and the maximum number of species will be found where the “frequency and intensity” of disturbances are at an intermediate scale.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Connell, J. (1978). Diversity of Tropical Rainforests and Coral Reefs. Science,4335, 1302-1310.&lt;/ref&gt; IDH helps explain the Gap Hypothesis which postulates that more light and more diverse resources caused by the falling of a canopy tree may aid in more species abundance.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Although treefall gaps have been shown to promote species diversity among a variety of species, a gap’s effect on different species is likely to produce mixed results (i.e. some species will experience more diversity due to gaps while others will not).

== Light penetration ==
[[File:Treefall gap in Institute Woods.jpg|thumb|A felled tree allows direct sunlight to reach the forest floor.]]
The creation of a treefall gap causes a break in the canopy to form, allowing light to penetrate through to the understory. This light can now reach [[shrub]]s and treelet species, which under normal circumstances never grow tall enough to reach the canopy.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Under a normal canopy (i.e. one where there is no treefall gap), there is very little light that filters through, placing a light limitation on the understory plant community.&lt;ref name="canham"&gt;Canham, C., Denslow, J., Platt, W., Runkle, J., Spies, T., &amp; White, P. (1990). Light regimes beneath closed canopies and tree-fall gaps in temperate and tropical forests. Canadian Journal of Forest Research-Revue Canadienne de Recherche Forestiere, 20(5), 620-631. {{doi|10.1139/x90-084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This light limitation often restricts a plant’s reproduction and growing ability.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; When a treefall gap forms, there is a distinguishable difference in the amount of light that penetrates through to the lower levels of the forest;&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; however, the amount of light that is now able to penetrate depends on how big the gap actually is.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; A treefall gap that is only 5 meters in diameter will allow less light to reach the understory than a larger gap that is 10 meters wide. In addition, a smaller gap will receive more direct radiation from the sun, whereas a larger gap will receive high amounts of diffuse radiation.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt; The increased amount of light that is now available to the understory community will release them from their previous light limitation.&lt;ref name="canham" /&gt;

== Seed dispersal ==
[[Seed dispersal]] in treefall gaps is significantly reduced compared to normal understory areas.&lt;ref name="puerta"&gt;Puerta-Piñero, C., Muller-Landau, H. C., Calderón, O., &amp; Wright, S. J. (2013). Seed arrival in tropical forest tree fall gaps. Ecology, 94(7), 1552-1562. {{doi|10.1890/12-1012.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggested that within the first three years after the gaps formed, the seed dispersal rate was 72% lower than the rates in nearby understory.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Most forms of dispersal, such as wind and animal dispersal, show a reduction in the number of seeds dispersed.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt;  However, explosive dispersion shows an increase &lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Explosive dispersion describes a mechanism by which the parent plant ejects its seeds using pressure, ensuring that they land far from the parent plant.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; This type of dispersal is used in several shrub species. The increase shows that treefall gaps have a positive effect on the seed dispersal of shrubs.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; These shrubs either survived the creation of the gap or migrated in soon after it was created.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt; Due to their unique method of dispersal, these plants have an advantage when colonizing the gap. As the treefall gap ages and the canopy layer begins to return to normal, other forms of seed dispersal begin to increase in frequency, eventually returning to their pre-gap values years after its formation.&lt;ref name="puerta" /&gt;	

== Species diversity ==

=== Flora ===

It is proposed that treefall gaps maintain plant species diversity in tropical forests in three main ways. First of all, they create habitats that have a lot of light.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Being in an area that now contains a high amount of light allows species that cannot grow in total or partial shade to develop rapidly. Due to the new levels of light, competition between the shade intolerant species and the species that prefer low levels of light would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; This release from competition would allow the number of shade intolerant species to increase. Second, species may be able to survive on resources that spread from the middle of the gap all the way to the surrounding denser forest.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Tree or plant diversity may be maintained by the distribution and sharing of resources over a gradient if species are uniquely adapted to the resources available in a specific treefall gap.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Lastly, the rate of regeneration of different species may differ based on the size of the gap. While species diversity may vary when the treefall gaps differ greatly in size, it has been argued that it is highly unlikely.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; This is due to the fact that the relationship between gap size and the microclimate is irregular because of the large spatial and temporal deviation in microclimate.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt; Support for these three hypotheses is mixed, but there is evidence that supports the fact that some species of plants benefit from being in gaps more than others. In tropical forests, gaps maintain the diversity of some plant groups, which could possibly contain much of the vascular plant community in these areas.&lt;ref name="carson" /&gt;

=== Insects ===

Treefall gaps, like the rest of tropical forests, contain an abundant number of animal species. As with all tropical habitats, insects make up the majority of the animal biomass.

==== Leaf litter ant assemblages ====

It has been thought that the development of treefall gaps would cause harm to the development of leaf litter ant assemblages, but that is not the case according to one study. Species of ants that are found in treefall gaps are the same species that are found in the actual densely wooded forests that surround them.&lt;ref name="patrick"&gt;Patrick, M., Fowler, D., Dunn, R., &amp; Sanders, N. (n.d.). Effects of Treefall Gap Disturbances on Ant Assemblages in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest. Biotropica, N/a-N/a.&lt;/ref&gt;
The formations of these gaps seem to have little to no effect on the ant species living there.&lt;ref name="patrick" /&gt;

==== Fruit-feeding nymphalid butterfly assemblages ====

There have been studies that show a noticeable difference in the species diversity of butterflies in treefall gaps and those in the surrounding understory. The type of vegetation present in the gaps play a key role in determining which species of butterfly lived there.&lt;ref name="pardonnet"&gt;Pardonnet, S., Beck, H., Milberg, P., &amp; Bergman, K. (2013). Effect of Tree-Fall Gaps on Fruit-Feeding Nymphalid Butterfly Assemblages in a Peruvian Rain Forest. Biotropica, 612-619.&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the hypothesis that in a natural forest, treefall gaps will promote species diversity.&lt;ref name="pardonnet"/&gt;

== Treefall gaps, blow-downs, and the carbon cycle ==
Where treefall gaps are usually formed by falling trees or branches due to old age or disease, large-scale blow-downs are caused by squall lines, which generate heavy rain and strong winds.&lt;ref name="Negron"&gt;Negrón‐Juárez, R. I., Chambers, J. Q., Guimaraes, G., Zeng, H., Raupp, C. F. M., Marra, D. M., Ribeiro, G. H. P. M., et al.(2010). Widespread Amazon forest tree mortality from a single cross‐basin squall line event. Geophysical Research Letters. {{doi|10.1029/2010GL043733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have measured the downburst speed of these winds to be between 26 and 41&amp;nbsp;m/s, which is enough force to cause large-scale blow-downs.&lt;ref name="Negron" /&gt; Studies have shown that small-scale disturbances, such as treefall gaps forming after tree deaths, have a higher reoccurrence rate than do large-scale disturbances, such as blow-downs.&lt;ref name="Santo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Espírito-Santo|first1=Fernando D.B.|last2=Gloor|first2=Manuel|last3=Keller|first3=Michael|last4=Malhi|first4=Yadvinder|authorlink4=Yadvinder Malhi|last5=Saatchi|first5=Sassan|last6=Nelson|first6=Bruce|last7=Junior|first7=Raimundo C.

Because of this, the Amazon is considered to be a [[carbon sink]].&lt;ref name="Santo" /&gt;

== Use of satellite technology in research ==

When researchers attempt to locate treefall gaps on a broad scale, it can be difficult to do so on the ground. This is due to the large scale of the forests that they are generally focusing on. Satellite imagery has proven quite useful for large-scale disturbances such as blow-downs, but remains difficult for small-scale disturbances such as treefall gaps. In some instances [[Global Positioning System]]s (GPS) are used to map the centers of treefall gaps in order to determine their frequency.&lt;ref name="Santo2"&gt;Espírito-Santo, F., Keller, M., Linder, E., Oliveira Junior, R., Pereira, C.,
