'''Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A.''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] racing car and road car maker founded by Italo-Austrian [[Carlo Abarth]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="autonews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070924/ANE01/70924007/1078/rss02&amp;rssfeed=rss02|title=Abarth wants 100 dealers in Europe|accessdate=2008-01-07|work=autonews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its logo is a shield with a stylized [[scorpion]] on a yellow and red background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/abarth-logo/|title=Abarth Logo: Design and History|accessdate=2011-07-28|work=Famouslogos.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A. is a fully owned [[subsidiary]] of [[FCA Italy S.p.A.]] (formerly Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A.), the subsidiary of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] (formerly of [[Fiat S.p.A.]]) controlling its European automotive production activities.

==History==
===1949: Abarth &amp; C.===
[[File:1950-Abarth205Monza.jpg|thumb|A 1950 205A, one of the first Abarth cars]]
Carlo Abarth was [[sporting director]] of the [[Cisitalia]] factory racing team starting in 1947.&lt;ref name="AISA corse"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aisastoryauto.it/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=111&amp;Itemid=45 |first=Lorenzo |last=Boscarelli |title=Abarth: le corse |conference=Abarth: l'uomo e le sue auto; [[Fiorenzuola d'Arda]], 9 May 2010 |work=Monografie AISA |volume=90 |language=it |pages=3–25 |format=PDF |publisher=Associazione Italiana per la Storia dell'Automobile |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213000702/http://www.aisastoryauto.it/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=111&amp;Itemid=45 |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
1948 saw the financial downfall of Cisitalia, spurred by the investments needed to put the [[Cisitalia 202|202]] coupé into production.  The following year the manufacturer folded, and founder [[Piero Dusio]] flew to [[Argentina]].
Carlo Abarth, funded by Armando Scagliarini,{{efn|Father of Cisitalia racing driver Guido Scagliarini}} took over Cisitalia's assets and on 31 March 1949 '''Abarth &amp; C.''' was founded in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="AISA compendio"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aisastoryauto.it/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=111&amp;Itemid=45 |first=Renzo |last=Avidano |title=Carlo Abarth - Il compendio di una vita per le auto e le corse |conference=Abarth: l'uomo e le sue auto; [[Fiorenzuola d'Arda]], 9 May 2010 |work=Monografie AISA |volume=90 |language=it |pages=29–32 |format=PDF |publisher=Associazione Italiana per la Storia dell'Automobile |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213000702/http://www.aisastoryauto.it/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=111&amp;Itemid=45 |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernimotori.com/abarth_history_en.html |title=Karl Abarth, the man and his history |website=bernimotori.com |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlo's astrological sign, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], was chosen as the company logo.
From the Cisitalia liquidation Abarth obtained five 204 sports cars (two complete Spiders and three unfinished), a D46 [[Open-wheel car|single seater]] and various spares.&lt;ref name="AISA corse" /&gt; The 204s were immediately rechristened Abarth 204 A.&lt;ref name="AISA corse" /&gt;
Abarth built and raced sports cars developed from the last [[Cisitalia]] cars. In addition to Guido Scagliarini, the "Squadra Abarth" racing team lined up celebrated drivers including [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Franco Cortese]] and [[Piero Taruffi]]. Notably Tazio Nuvolari made his last appearance in racing at the wheel of an Abarth 204 A, winning its class in the Palermo–Monte Pellegrino [[hillclimbing|hillclimb]] on 10 April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,5/articleid,1596_02_1953_0191_0005_22054961/ |title=Quando venne a Torino per la sua ultima gara |date=13 August 1953 |newspaper=[[La Stampa|Stampa Sera]] |page=5 |accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside racing, the company's main activity was producing and selling accessories and performance parts for Fiat, [[Lancia]], Cisitalia and [[Simca]] cars, like [[inlet manifold]]s and [[Muffler|silencer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,2/articleid,1599_02_1951_0087_0002_22415418/ |title=Le attrattive del Salone |date=12 April 1951 |newspaper=[[La Stampa|Stampa Sera]] |page=2 |accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 1951 the company's headquarters were moved to [[Turin]];&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; Abarth began his well-known association with [[Fiat]] in 1952, when it built the [[Abarth 1500 Biposto]] on Fiat mechanicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rickcarey.com/Catalog%20Descriptions/Abarth%20Biposto/AbarthBiposto.htm |title=1952 Abarth 1500 Biposto Coupé |website=rickcarey.com |accessdate=28 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721102318/http://www.rickcarey.com/Catalog%20Descriptions/Abarth%20Biposto/AbarthBiposto.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Abarth was successful in [[hillclimbing]] and [[sports car racing]], mainly in classes from 850 cc to 2000 cc, competing with [[Porsche 904]] and [[Dino (automobile)|Ferrari Dino]]. [[Hans Herrmann]] was a factory driver from 1962 until 1965, winning the [[1000 km Nürburgring|500 km Nürburgring]] in 1963 with [[Teddy Pilette]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abarthcarsuk.com/about-abarth/the-history-of-abarth/|title=The history of Abarth|accessdate=2014-05-28|work=abarthcarsuk.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052707/http://abarthcarsuk.com/about-abarth/the-history-of-abarth/|archive-date=29 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abarth promised [[Johann Abt]] that he could race a factory car free if he won all the races he entered.{{When|date=October 2013}} Abt almost succeeded: of the 30 races he entered, Abt won 29 and finished second once.{{When|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Abt later founded [[Abt Sportsline]].

[[File:Abarth 695.JPG|thumb|Abarth 595, derived from the Fiat 500]]
Abarth produced high-performance exhaust pipes, diversifying into tuning kits for road vehicles, mainly for Fiat. A racing exhaust was produced for the 1950s [[Lambretta]] models "D" and "LD". Original Abarth LD exhausts are now valuable collectors' items. Reproductions are available which carry the Abarth name, how Fiat feels about this is not known. Lambretta even held several 125 cc motorcycle land speed records during the 1950s thanks partly to the exhaust that Abarth developed for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racinglambrettas.com/mielambretta/dracer.html |title=125 Model D Racer |website=racinglambrettas.com |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lambrettista.net/2013/10/07/lambretta-world-land-speed-record-scooter/ |title=Lambretta World Land Speed Record Scooter |website=lambrettista.net |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abarth also helped build sports or racing cars with [[Porsche]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.porschearchive.com/render.cfm?source=20775~356B_Carrera+GTL+Abarth~1960-1960/ |title=Porsche 356B Carrera GTL Abarth |website=porschearchive.com |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Simca]].

===1971: Fiat takeover===
Carlo sold Abarth to Fiat on 31 July 1971.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The acquisition was only made public by Fiat with a press release on 15 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,17/articleid,0139_01_1971_0242_0017_4835645/ |title=L'Abarth entra nel gruppo Fiat |date=16 October 1971 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |page=17 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Fiat was not interested in the Reparto Corse racing operations, these were taken over by [[Enzo Osella]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Osella obtained cars, spares, technicians and drivers (amongst them [[Arturo Merzario]]), and continued the racing activity founding the [[Osella]] racing team.&lt;ref name="AISA Fiat"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aisastoryauto.it/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=111&amp;Itemid=45 |first=Renzo |last=Avidano |title=I rapporti con la Fiat |conference=Abarth: l'uomo e le sue auto; [[Fiorenzuola d'Arda]], 9 May 2010 |work=Monografie AISA |volume=90 |language=it |pages=33–35 |format=PDF |publisher=Associazione Italiana per la Storia dell'Automobile |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213000702/http://www.aisastoryauto.it/cms/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=111&amp;Itemid=45 |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ended for Abarth the days of sport prototype and hill climb racing.

Under Fiat ownership, Abarth became the Fiat Group's racing department, managed by engine designer [[Aurelio Lampredi]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Abarth prepared Fiat's rally cars, including the [[Fiat 124 Sport Spider|Fiat 124 Abarth Rally]] and [[Fiat 131#Motorsport|131 Abarth]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;
In December 1977, in advance of the 1978 racing season, the beforehand competing Abarth and [[Lancia#Lancia in motorsport|Squadra Corse Lancia]] factory racing operations were merged by Fiat into a single entity named ''EASA'' (''Ente per l'Attività Sportiva Automobilistica'', Organization for Car Sports Racing Activities).&lt;ref name="lastampa EASA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,17/articleid,1099_01_1977_0277_0018_16066498/ |title=Rally, Fiat e Lancia si uniscono in un nuovo "super-squadrone" |first=Michele |last=Fenu |date=6 December 1977 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |page=17 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesare Fiorio]] (previously in charge of the Lancia rally team) was appointed director, while [[Daniele Audetto]] was [[sporting director]]; the EASA headquarters were set up in Abarth's Corso Marche (Turin) offices.&lt;ref name="lastampa EASA" /&gt;
The combined racing department developed the [[Lancia Montecarlo#Montecarlo Turbo|Lancia Beta Montecarlo Turbo]] [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] racing car which won the [[1980 World Championship for Makes]] and the [[1981 World Endurance Championship of Makes]]. It also created the [[Lancia Rally 037]] [[Group B]] rally car which won for Lancia the [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983]] [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' champions|World Manufacturers' Championship]]).

On 1 October 1981, Abarth &amp; C. ceased to exist and was replaced by ''Fiat Auto Gestione Sportiva'', a division of the parent company specialized in the management of racing programmes that would remain in operation through to the end of 1999, when it changed to ''Fiat Auto Corse S.p.A.''

Some commercial models built by Fiat or its subsidiaries [[Lancia]] and [[Autobianchi]] were co-branded Abarth, including the [[Autobianchi A112 Abarth]], a popular "[[boy racer]]" because it was lightweight and inexpensive.

In the 1980s, Abarth name was mainly used to mark performance cars, such as the [[Fiat Ritmo]] Abarth 125/130 TC.

In 2000s, Fiat used the Abarth brand to designate a trim/model level, as in the [[Fiat Stilo]] Abarth.

===2007: Rebirth of Abarth &amp; C. S.p.a.===
On 1 February 2007 Abarth was re-established as an independent unit with the launch of the current company, '''Abarth &amp; C. S.p.a.''',&lt;ref name="repubblica abarth"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.repubblica.it/2007/02/motori/febbraio-07/debutta-gamma-abarth/debutta-gamma-abarth.html |title= Svolta Fiat: torna l'Abarth e diventa marchio indipendente |date=23 January 2007 |newspaper= [[La Repubblica]] |first=Vincenzo |last=Borgomeo |language=it |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; controlled 100% by Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A., the [[subsidiary]] of Fiat S.p.A. dealing with the production and selling of [[car|passenger cars]] and [[light commercial vehicles]].
The first model launched was the [[Fiat Grande Punto|Abarth Grande Punto]] and the Abarth Grande Punto S2000. The brand is based in the Officine 83, part of the old Mirafiori engineering plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duemotori.com/news/auto_news/23072_Abarths_new_premises_in_Turin.php Abarth's new premises in Turin] from duemotori.it (18 Feb 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] as of 2011 is Harald Wester.&lt;ref name="Nominato il nuovo CEO di Abarth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.supereva.it/guida_abarth/interventi/2009/01/harald-wester-nuovo-ceo-di-abarth|title=Nominato il nuovo CEO di Abarth|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Abarth's parent company was renamed [[FCA Italy S.p.A.]], reflecting the incorporation of [[Fiat S.p.A.]] into [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] that took place in the previous months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14651">'''Advanced nuclear''' is an emerging area of the energy industry focused on designing and commercializing next generation reactors for nuclear energy production. Encompassing more comprehensive and radical technological innovations and design advancements, these innovations aim to dramatically improve performance and eliminate known problems associated with the existing generation [[nuclear reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (Gen I and Gen II) currently in use around the world.

The earliest Gen I and Gen II nuclear reactors built utilized the [[light-water reactor]] design in one of three variants: the [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), the [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), and the [[supercritical water reactor]] (SCWR). The use of the light-water design (i.e. using regular water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and not [[heavy water]], &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as both its coolant and [[neutron moderator]] but needing a plentiful supply) in all commercial reactors was a trade-off that enabled the industry to leverage the purchasing clout of Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]], who was keen on procuring nuclear-powered submarines for the Navy, to grow quickly. The choice, however, imposed a riskier design that many argued was not optimized for terrestrial energy, bringing both competitive advantages as well as fateful disadvantages to the initial development and subsequent growth of the commercial nuclear power fleet. Despite operating to the military's exacting specifications and winning praise and massive contracts from government buyers, the industry quickly earned the distrust of the public. (See the [[Anti-nuclear movement]].)

[[Generation III reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s contain yet further incremental refinements to aspects of [[Generation II reactor|Generation II]] [[nuclear reactor]] designs but were not very popular. Improvements were developed for [[Nuclear fuel|fuel technology]], [[thermal efficiency]], to safety systems to reduce maintenance and capital costs. The first Generation III reactor was [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki 6]] (an [[Advanced boiling water reactor|ABWR]]) in 1996 but the declining support for the underlying Generation II light-water design, caused relatively few third generation reactors to be built. 

[[Generation IV reactor|Generation IV]] designs are the first generation where innovator in Advanced Nuclear technologies are exploring paradigm shifts in methodologies. Gen IV projects encompass not just innovative nuclear fission concepts, like the [[Molten salt reactor]], [[Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[High temperature gas cooled reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, but also [[Fusion power]] and even Low Energy Nuclear Reactors (LENR), which generate heat through a series of controlled chemical reactions that then cause a nuclear bond to shift, which results in heat output. Gen IV is still in development as of 2017, and are not expected to start entering commercial operation until after 2020.
[[File:ORNL Alvin Weinberg MSRE 6Kh.jpg|thumb|ORNL director Alvin Weinberg notes the 6,000 hour of molten salt reactor experiment full-power operation in 1968.]]
Some of the different reactor design ideas being explored and developed for Advanced nuclear reactors, now thought of as [[Generation IV reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ('''Gen IV''') today were actually first conceived within the National Labs back in the 1960s. Several of these concepts, including [[Alvin M. Weinberg]]'s [[Molten salt reactor]] (MSR) developed at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), even had the benefit of being prototyped and tested over a period of time. Weinberg's MSR became the first reactor to run on Uranium 233 in 1968 and logged more than 13,000 hours at "full power" before being shut down in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ornl.gov/blog/ornl-review/time-warp-molten-salt-reactor-experiment-alvin-weinberg-s-magnum-opus|title=Time Warp: Molten Salt Reactor Experiment—Alvin Weinberg’s magnum opus {{!}} ORNL|website=www.ornl.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the concept of using a molten salt brew that acts both as the fuel and the "containment" of the reaction by using the ionic bonds of the salt to capture and contain the heat generated from the nuclear reaction, thereby dispensing with the need for expensive containment structures and eliminating much of risk and cost, remains of keen interest to those exploring Advanced nuclear technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orr, Jr.|first=Robert|date=September 2013|title=The Molten Salt Reactor: Nuclear Energy Without Fear?|url=|journal=Infinite Energy|volume=Issue 111|pages=35-36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the Obama White House hosted a Summit on Nuclear Energy to examine the role of nuclear energy in reducing carbon emissions as part of its efforts to combat the threat of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nei.org/News-Media/Media-Room/News-Releases/White-House-Summit-Spotlights-Nuclear-Energy-s-Val|title=White House Summit Spotlights Nuclear Energy's Value in Climate Change Fight|last=|first=|date=November 5, 2015|website=www.nei.org|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 2016, the first "Advanced Nuclear Summit and Showcase" was held in Washington, D.C., hosted by [[Third Way (United States)|Third Way]], in partnership with the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL), [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (ANL), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/events/advanced-nuclear-summit|title=Advanced Nuclear Summit &amp; Showcase|website=Third Way|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was also attended by a bi-partisan group of senators—[[Lisa Murkowski]] (R-AK), [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI), [[Mike Crapo]] (R-ID) and [[Cory Booker]] (D-NJ)—along with representatives from more than 150 organizations to show support for advancing nuclear innovation in the U.S. According to Third Way, Advanced Nuclear technologies are developing more rapidly than most experts expected and, as of 2015, there were 48 companies, start-ups or projects with funding of more than $1.3 billion in private capital working to "build the next generation of nuclear reactors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-advanced-nuclear-industry|title=The Advanced Nuclear Industry|website=Third Way|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like the growth in technological innovation in other parts of the energy industry, which has seen the emergence of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting methane from shale formations where previously it was unavailable and improvements in solar panel efficiency and wind turbine efficiency, there's been a resurgence of interest in nuclear from younger engineers, physics Ph.Ds and investors seeking scale-level solutions to meeting global energy need with non-carbon-emitting energy. (See for example [[Transatomic Power]], whose website says "We at Transatomic Power are nuclear engineers with a new approach for electricity generation. We started this company because we believe it is possible to power the world while helping it thrive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transatomicpower.com/|title=Homepage - Transatomic|website=Transatomic|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Despite the reported $1.3 billion in private funding, in fact experts worry that the lack of federal support for nuclear innovation in the U.S., means that most of the critical design and development work in Advanced Nuclear reactors is now being done in India, Russia, China, Canada, France, Japan, Korea and even Saudi Arabia, where in 2010 a royal decree said: "The development of atomic energy is essential to meet the Kingdom's growing requirements for energy to generate electricity, produce desalinated water and reduce reliance on depleting hydrocarbon resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/saudi-arabia.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Saudi Arabia - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia will be investing $80 billion in nuclear development over the next decade or two. India, Russia and China have all made enormous investments in support of their country's nuclear energy capabilities and, in 1983 Russia became the first country to put a Molten Salt Reactor, the [[BN-600 reactor]] online, which it did without much fanfare in the aftermath of its [[Chernobyl disaster]]. India, which "published about twice the number of papers on thorium as its nearest competitors, during each of the years from 2002 to 2006"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=srikumar|date=September 2010|title=Thorium Utilisation for Sustainable Supply of Nuclear Energy (pdf)|url=http://www1.phys.vt.edu/~kimballton/gem-star/workshop/presentations/banerjee.pdf|journal=Virginia Tech|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is expected to complete the world's first Advanced Thorium Molten Salt Reactor in late 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/10/india-has-almost-finished-the-worlds-first-advanced-thorium-nuclear-reactor/|title=India Has Almost Finished The World’s First Advanced Thorium Nuclear Reactor|website=The Daily Caller|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; even while it is already in the process of building the next six reactors taking the advances even further, and hopes to provide as much as 25% of its future electricity needs with clean advanced nuclear energy, utilizing its abundant thorium reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theenergycollective.com/dan-yurman/2398307/india-goes-large-plans-build-next-round-reactors|title=India Goes Large in Plans to Build Next Round of Reactors - The Energy Collective|date=2017-02-13|work=The Energy Collective|accessdate=2017-07-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be outdone, China plans to spend $570 billion building more than 60 nuclear power plants over the next decade, with a portion of this to develop its Advanced Nuclear capabilities,[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/study-us-losing-ground-russia-china-nuclear-power-20467] positioning itself to be the "Amazon.com" of nuclear commerce, according to Kenneth Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/study-us-losing-ground-russia-china-nuclear-power-20467|title=Study: U.S. "Losing Ground" To Russia And China On Nuclear Power|last=Follett|first=Andrew|website=The National Interest|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Global Nexus Initiative (GNI) found that, with the U.S. practically ignoring the needs of those working on Advanced Nuclear, the U.S. will lose significant competitive advantage within the energy industry as well as forego geopolitical influence by allowing its nuclear power industry to stagnate and fall behind, even while fossil fuels become increasingly supplanted by clean alternatives. Richard Meserve, former Chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and a member of the GNI study working group, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“This report draws attention to nuclear power’s geopolitical dimension, which often is overlooked in the debate. The nuclear rules are shaped by the countries with the largest market share, and traditional leaders like the US will soon be overtaken by China and Russia. There is a danger that the U.S. will lose the capacity to influence the global norms for safety, security and non-proliferation. There thus are national security issues at stake.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalnexusinitiative.org/uncategorized/nuclear-energys-role-in-fighting-climate-change-under-threat/|title=Nuclear Energy’s Role in Fighting Climate Change Under Threat – GNI|website=globalnexusinitiative.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fighting an uphill battle to change a bad reputation ==
Despite having funded the birth of nuclear age, the U.S. has not chosen to fund the refining work needed to optimize nuclear reactors for terrestrial energy. Into this void, the Generation IV International Forum, founded in 2001, has stepped, as "a co-operative international endeavor . . . to carry out the research and development needed to establish the feasibility and performance capabilities of the next generation nuclear energy systems." There are currently ten active members: [[Canada]], [[China]], the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom), [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]. The non-active members are [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Whether this framework will enable the job to get done is yet to be seen.

The global race is on to design and commercialize cheaper, safer, and more efficient nuclear reactors to provide clean energy to the world. Even though many of the original ideas, technologies and research came out of the U.S.'s early investments in nuclear research and the work of thousands of American nuclear physicists and engineers laboring in the National Laboratories and nuclear industry in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, whatever patents and [[Intellectual property]] protections there were have long been expired. Now anyone anywhere can look at the achievements of people like [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] and start to develop the perfect thorium molten salt reactor. Already it is evident that Russia, India and China have been investing heavily in such efforts. American entrepreneurs, while appearing to be up for the challenge, are handicapped by having no clear government support, no federal funding, no regulatory pathway and very little in the way public support for their search for technological solutions that could unleash a vast new [[clean energy]] industry, producing jobs and retaining geopolitical influence on nuclear performance and safety standards, while simultaneously contributing to our solution for climate change. Even with growing bipartisan support for maintaining a robust and innovative nuclear industry in the face of all of these challenges, the lingering opposition of the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] makes the work of America's Advanced Nuclear entrepreneurs an uphill battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.energyxxi.org/nuclear|title=Nuclear|date=2014-08-15|work=Global Energy Institute|accessdate=2017-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)"''', established in 1985,  is a self-regulatory voluntary organization of the [[advertising industry]] in India. It is a non-Government body. ASCI is committed to the cause of self- regulation in advertising ensuring the protection of the interest of consumers. ASCI seeks to ensure that advertisements conform to its Code for Self-Regulation, which requires advertisements to be legal, decent, honest and truthful and not hazardous or harmful while observing fairness in competition. ASCI looks into complaints across ALL MEDIA such as Print, TV, Radio, hoardings, SMS, Emailers, Internet / web-site, product packaging, brochures, promotional material and point of sale material etc. ASCI’s role has been acclaimed by various Government bodies including The Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA), Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of AYUSH as well as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The association with these Government bodies is to co-regulate and curb misleading and objectionable advertisements in the respective sectors. In January 2017, the Supreme Court of India in its judgement has also affirmed and recognized the self-regulatory mechanism as an effective pre-emptive step to statutory provisions in the sphere of advertising content regulation for TV and Radio in India. ASCI is a part of the Executive Committee of International Council on Ad Self-Regulation (ICAS). Among several awards bestowed by the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA), ASCI bagged two Gold Global Best Practice Awards for the Mobile App “ASCIonline” (2016) and for reducing the time taken to process complaints (2013).

==Origin==

Like other countries around the world, India too has a [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO) for [[advertising]] content  – The Advertising Standards Council of India, ASCI founded in 1985. The four main constituents of advertising industry viz advertisers, advertising agencies, media and allied professions came together to form this independent NGO. The aim of ASCI is to maintain and enhance the public's confidence in advertising. Their mandate is that all advertising material must be truthful, legal and honest, decent and not objectify women, safe for [[consumer]]s - especially children and last but not the least, fair to their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascionline.org/goals/whyselfregulation.htm |title=ASCI &amp;#124; Why Self Regulation |publisher=Ascionline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201181624/http://www.ascionline.org/goals/whyselfregulation.htm |archivedate=2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members of ASCI==

ASCI’s team consists of the Board of Governors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascionline.org/support/boardofgovernors.htm |title=ASCI &amp;#124; Board of Governors |publisher=Ascionline.org |date=2011-02-01 |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309201932/http://ascionline.org/support/boardofgovernors.htm |archivedate=2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Consumer Complaints Council (CCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascionline.org/support/cccmembers.htm |title=ASCI &amp;#124; CCC Members |publisher=Ascionline.org |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209152248/http://www.ascionline.org/support/cccmembers.htm |archivedate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Secretariat. ASCI has 16 members in its Board of Governors, four each representing the key sectors such as Advertisers, [[advertising agencies]], media and allied professions such as market research, consulting, business education etc. The CCC currently has about 28 members: 6 are from within the industry and 8 are from the civil society like well-known doctors, lawyers, journalists, academicians, consumer activists, etc. The CCC’s decision on complaint against any ad is final. ASCI also has its own independent Secretariat of 5 members which is headed by the Secretary General.

There is no other non governmental body in India which regulates the advertising content that is released in India. If an ad that is released in India seems objectionable, a person can write to ASCI with their complaint. This complaint will be deliberated on by the CCC after providing due process to advertiser to defend the ad against the complaint and depending on whether the ad is in alignment with the ASCI code and law of the land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascionline.org/regulation/codepertinentextracts.htm |title=Asci &amp;#124; Asci Code |publisher=Ascionline.org |date=1985-11-20 |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201181628/http://www.ascionline.org/regulation/codepertinentextracts.htm |archivedate=2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the complaint is upheld or not upheld and if upheld then the ad is voluntarily either withdrawn or modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Agencies |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/ASCI-seeks-to-benefit-from-global-selfregulation-practices/254485/ |title=ASCI seeks to benefit from global self-regulation practices |publisher=Express India |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011195222/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/ASCI-seeks-to-benefit-from-global-selfregulation-practices/254485/ |archivedate=2012-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Government of India amended the [http://www.mib.nic.in/writereaddata/html_en_files/content_reg/PAC.pdf Cable TV Network Rules’ Advertising Code] by which ads which violate ASCI code cannot be permitted on TV.

==Self-Regulation==

Almost all professional fields have self-regulatory bodies governing their activities. For the advertising [[fraternity]], until 1985 there was none. Due to this there was a lot of false, misleading and offensive advertising. This led to consumers losing faith in advertising and hence resenting it. It was decided that if this continued it would not take time for statutory regulations such as censorship to be imposed on advertising content.

In 1985, the ASCI adopted a Code for Self-Regulation in Advertising. With the introduction of the code, the aim is to promote honest and decent advertising and fair competition in the industry. It will also ensure the protection of consumer interests and all concerned with the ad industry - advertisers, media, advertising agencies and others who help in the creation or placement of advertisements.

As the fraternity starts accepting the code, it will result in fewer false claims, fewer unfair advertisements and increased respect for advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kalpana Ganesh |url=http://www.indiaprwire.com/pressrelease/advertising/2010090661212.htm |title=ASCI To Introduce Advertising Code For Educational Sector |publisher=Indiaprwire.com |date=2010-09-06 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for ASCI==
When an advertiser is creating an ad, the consumer is his audience. The feedback from a consumer is important to the advertiser so he can be assured if his message has been correctly conveyed. If a consumer feels that a particular advertisement is in bad taste or is false in its claims, they need a body or council to whom they can air their grievances and who will take any appropriate action, if necessary. ASCI as a self-regulatory body governing advertising content is the ideal medium as its purpose is to serve both the advertisers as well as the consumers.

'''Alfred Müller''' (from 1938 '''Miler'''; 1888 &amp;ndash; 1945) was [[Croatia]]n entrepreneur and oldest son of [[Adolf Müller (industrialist)|Adolf Müller]].&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Müller was born in [[Zagreb]] to a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family, with younger brother Leo.&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt; He graduated from higher technical school in [[Vienna]]. Müller was married to Klara ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Hafner) with whom he had two children, son Alan and daughter Evelina. After his father death, Müller inherited "Balkan" cinema and part of residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street. In 1938, because of the political situation and [[antisemitism]] caused by [[Nazi propaganda]], Müller and his family converted to [[Catholicism]] and change their surname to Miler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ognjen Kraus|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Müller sold the residential-commercial complex in Varšavska and Masarykova Street to a Topić family from Zagreb. That same year Müller and his family moved to [[France]]. During [[World War II]], Müller and his wife where arrested by [[Gestapo]] in France with the help from [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], while their daughter managed to save herself by hiding at friends. Müller son joined the [[French Resistance]]. In August 1944, Müller was deported to [[Dachau concentration camp]], where in January 1945 he was killed. Müller family survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], his wife and daughter moved to [[United States]] after the war, and in 1949 his son returned and stayed in Zagreb where he still lives. With the [[independence of Croatia]] in 1991, Müller son sought the return of the property which was taken from his father by [[Ustaše]] and later the communist of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/m-llerovi---povijest-jedne-zagrebacke-obitelji/188361/ |title=Müllerovi - Povijest jedne zagrebačke obitelji |publisher=[[Jutarnji list]] |date=2008-04-20 |language=Croatian |archivedate=7 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023630/http://www.jutarnji.hr/m-llerovi---povijest-jedne-zagrebacke-obitelji/188361/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zagrebonline.hr/darujemo-prvi-hrvatski-zvucni-film-lisinski/|title=Darujemo prvi hrvatski zvučni film "Lisinski"|publisher=www.zagreb.hr|date=2011-06-27|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The ''Art Cologne'' was the first art fair organized by and for commercial galleries to exhibit and sell Modern and Contemporary art. This kind of art fair distinguished itself from earlier art fairs such as the [[57th Street Art Fair]] in Chicago or the [[Ann Arbor Art Fairs]] in Michigan, in which artists themselves marketed their works directly to the public from stands set-up in the streets. The ''Art Cologne'' and other international art fairs that followed offer private galleries conditions similar to their own back home: booths in buildings enabling them to present art works of high value.

== History ==
[[File:Koelner Kunstmarkt Katalog 70.jpg|thumb|120px|right|catalogue cover]] The ''Kölner Kunstmarkt'' was founded by gallerists Hein Stünke and Rudolph Zwirner in 1967 in an attempt to reinvigorate the weak market for contemporary art. With Bonn as the new capital city of Germany, the [[Rhineland]] – an industrial powerhouse at the centre of Europe driving the West German economy and acting as a hub for the entire western European economy – took over as the centre of the West German art world. The first ''Kölner Kunstmarkt'' took place in the Gürzenich festival hall in the medieval part of the city; the following year Kunsthalle Köln was added as an additional location. The fair helped to establish Cologne as a new center of contemporary art. A West German dealer and a West German artist set new records at the 1969 edition of Kölner Kunstmarkt: René Block sold a work by [[Joseph Beuys]] – known later as ''Das Rudel'' – at DM 110,000, making Beuys the first West German artist to beat the one-hundred-thousand-mark mark.

In 1974, Art Cologne moved to its current location, the [[koelnmesse|tradeshow halls]] at the district of [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]. On this occasion the name was changed to ''Internationaler Kunstmarkt (IKM)''. Between 1976 and 1983, the fair alternated between Cologne and Düsseldorf and began to establish its international credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (April 12, 2016), [http://theartnewspaper.com/market/art-market-news/fifty-editions-on-can-the-world-s-first-art-fair-regain-top-billing/ Fifty editions on, can Art Cologne regain top billing?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's name ''Art Cologne'' was adopted in 1984. In 1994, the fair was bought by the event organizer [[Koelnmesse]]; exhibitor numbers at the fair swelled to 323 that year.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (April 12, 2016), [http://theartnewspaper.com/market/art-market-news/fifty-editions-on-can-the-world-s-first-art-fair-regain-top-billing/ Fifty editions on, can Art Cologne regain top billing?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of art fairs escalated, in the 2000s Art Cologne lost exhibitors and collectors to competing events in London, Basel, Berlin and Miami.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hickley (April 21, 2008), [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=muse&amp;sid=aelYFxtdTHlQ Art Cologne Sells Picasso, Warhol, Kirchner as Visitors Decline ] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the Berlin art scene, a bevy of remedies — special events and exhibitions, prizes and promotional gags — were devised to rejuvenate the fair, but they proved of little avail. An unattractive shift of venue within the fairgrounds and a change of dates from autumn to spring only exaggerated the unease of public and professionals alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/arts/02iht-gallo.html?scp=1&amp;sq=art+cologne&amp;st=nyt|title = Art Cologne Hangs On | first = David | last = Galloway| date = May 1, 2009 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate  = September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the fair was moved to April from the fall to avoid coinciding with other events. Still, Art Cologne drew just 60,000 visitors that year, 10,000 fewer than in 2006, and the 2008 edition had only 55,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hickley (April 21, 2008), [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;refer=muse&amp;sid=aelYFxtdTHlQ Art Cologne Sells Picasso, Warhol, Kirchner as Visitors Decline ] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Art Cologne abandoned its sister event on the Spanish island of [[Mallorca]]&lt;ref&gt;David Galloway (April 25, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/arts/25iht-gallo.1.5433659.html The ART Cologne fair shifts dates and find new competition] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; after just one edition and appointed Los Angeles gallery owner Daniel Hug, grandson of the Hungarian artist [[László Moholy-Nagy]], to be its new director, part of a drive to boost attendance and win back top collectors and dealers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/27/entertainment/et-quick27.S4 L.A. dealer to head Art Cologne] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2012 edition, Hug invited [[New Art Dealers Alliance|Nada]], the Miami and New York fair for young artists, to join Art Cologne. The tie-up was first called Nada Cologne and has since renamed Collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (April 12, 2016), [http://theartnewspaper.com/market/art-market-news/fifty-editions-on-can-the-world-s-first-art-fair-regain-top-billing/ Fifty editions on, can Art Cologne regain top billing?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, dealers specializing in Modern and post-war art got their own floor for the first time. The largest, middle floor hosted the fair’s contemporary section, featuring international galleries such as [[David Zwirner]], [[Hauser &amp; Wirth]], [[Michael Werner Gallery]] and [[Sprüth Magers]]. The third floor was devoted to New Contemporaries, the young galleries section sponsored by [[Deutsche Bank]], and Collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Rojas (April 16, 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/art-market/sweet-smell-of-success-for-reborn-art-cologne/ Sweet smell of success for reborn Art Cologne] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, Art Cologne and Nada ended the Collaborations segment; instead, Hug rebranded all the fair’s contemporary art sections as “Neumarkt”, named after an alternative Cologne fair in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (October 14, 2016), [https://www.ft.com/content/d5d1e3da-8f04-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78 The Art Market: Cautiously optimistic?] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Art Cologne entered in discussions with abc art berlin contemporary to establish a new fair called Art Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Kobel (April 12, 2017), [http://theartnewspaper.com/market/art-market-news/art-cologne-in-advanced-negotiations-to-take-over-berlin-s-abc-fair-/ Art Cologne in advanced negotiations with Berlin's abc fair] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
In 2008, Art Cologne's organizers chose 150 exhibitors of which about two-thirds were German. At the 2012 edition, German galleries made up 65% of the 200 international exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Sansom (24 April 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Bringing-back-Art-Cologne/26433 Bringing back Art Cologne] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of exhibitors has remained almost unchanged ever since, with around 200 galleries from 23 countries taking part in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Rojas (April 16, 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/art-market/sweet-smell-of-success-for-reborn-art-cologne/ Sweet smell of success for reborn Art Cologne] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet basic costs of €35,000 for the simplest stand, a gallery owner needs sales of €200,000.&lt;ref&gt;David Galloway (November 9, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/style/09iht-galloway_ed3_.html A leaner and sleeker Art Cologne] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7221">The '''Brunswick Brick Tile &amp; Pottery Company''' was established in 1870&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5831011 |title=THE BRUNSWICK BRICK MANUFACTORY. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=7 September 1870 |accessdate=24 November 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a site in Albert Street [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], as one of the first modern mechanical brickworks in Australia. It was also known as the Hoffman Patent Brick &amp; Tile Company, Hoffman Brickworks, or just ' Hoffman's' for most of its 100 plus years of operation.&lt;ref&gt;Di MacLeod &amp; Ian Newman, Clay Industry sites of Brunswick 1849 to 1900, Heritage Planning and Management Heritage Identification and Assessment Semester 1990Brunswick Library history room 620.142 MAC&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoffman brickworks was founded by Jenkin Collier and James McKenzie with Messrs Barry Owen and Rourke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it employed Pratt brick presses, and constructed [[Hoffman kiln|Hoffman]] patent continuous firing kilns, developed by [[Hoffmann kiln|Friedreich Hoffman]] in Stettin, Prussia in 1859. In 1887 the company had ordered [[Bradley &amp; Craven Ltd]] automatic brick presses, which were fabricated by [[Langlands foundry]] and a year later purchased another at the centennial exhibition. The first kiln was circular, but the company rapidly expanded and added at least five oblong Hoffman Kilns between 1880 and about 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.uq.edu.au/ojs/index.php/aa/article/download/1534/1522 lan Stuart, A History of the Victorian Brick Industry: 1826-1920]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 the company erected the new No 2 works in Dawson Street Brunswick, south of the original works, as the clay pit had been exhausted, having excavated up to the backs of nearby houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/07/07_04_Stuart.pdf Iain Stuart, Why Did the Hoffman Brick and Pottery Works Stop Making Bricks? ''Australian Historical Archaeology'' 7, 1989]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This works employed over 400 men and produced over 40 million bricks per year, reflecting the importance of the industry on the landboom of the 1880s. After the depression of the 1890s, the company expanded throughout the following decades.  The Hoffmans factory whistle, which rang from 7:15 to 7:20 in the morning, to wake workers, was so regular that locals could set their watches by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The company also added a pottery works, much of the production going to terracotta sewage pipes as the Melbourne Sewage Scheme was being construction around the turn of the century. The pottery also manufactured a wide range of domestic wares including the [[Mel-rose Australian Ware]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auspottery.com/Hoffman_history.htm Australian Decorative Pottery, Hoffman Brick &amp; Potteries history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Potteries of Brunswick'' by Gregory Hill ({{ISBN|0 9577065 2 9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoffman No 1 was used as a rubbish tip from 1947, taking 17 years to be filled completely. By 1981, it had settled sufficiently to be redeveloped by the local Council as a park, named the M.W. Clifton Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Brunswick works was instrumental both in introducing new technology into the Australian brick industry, but also in restructuring the commercial basis, leading the move to takeovers and mergers and the creation of a brick [[cartel]] or [[combine (enterprise)|combine]], to set the price and production quotas for many competing brick companies.

In 1960 the Brunswick brickworks was taken over by Clifton Holdings, another brickmaker from St Georges Road Preston, which downsized operations and sold off assets at Brunswick and other brickworks, before it was itself taken over with Nubrick to form the [[Brickworks Limited|Austral Brick Company]]. The works operated up to the late 1990s, but was sold to a developer on the basis that part of the site would be preserved and restored. The site has been partly redeveloped for apartments, but retains the brick press building which was damaged by fire in &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/residents-evacuated-after-fire-at-brunswick-brickworks-20180324-p4z62q.html 'Residents evacuated after fire at Brunswick Brickworks' By Goya Dmytryshchak ''The Age'' On-line 24 March 2018 — 5:36pm]&lt;/ref&gt; and was still in a dilapidated condition as of 2018. This building was also proposed to be demolished by current owners&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.heritage.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/91094/hoff-Heritage_Impact_Statement.pdf Sungrove Corporation Pty Ltd, Heritage Impact Statement 1/11/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;). Two Hoffman Kilns, which have been converted by reconstruction of the upper levels for residences, and a third kiln chimney remain. Some of the adjacent pottery works buildings have also been converted for housing.

Hoffman's Dawson Street works is one of two surviving early Melbourne Brickworks, the other being the [[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill brickworks]]. The site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/172/former-hoffman-brickworks# |title=OnMyDoorStep, Heritage database VHR/HO0703 |access-date=2013-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234024/http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/172/former-hoffman-brickworks# |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and staff==
CfA was co-founded in May 2015 by Anne Weismann and Louis Mayberg (who serves on the group's advisory board).&lt;ref name="New"&gt;[http://campaignforaccountability.org/new-lawsuit-demands-sec-issue-rule-requiring-corporations-disclose-political-donations/ New Lawsuit Demands SEC Issue Rule Requiring Corporations Disclose Political Donations]; Campaign for Accountability; May 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Yurus &amp; Tarini Parti, [http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/politico-influence/2015/05/too-soon-to-call-tpa-a-k-street-fail-levick-names-klingler-svp-cassidy-signs-five-mayberg-and-wismann-launch-nonprofit-212543 Mayberg and Weismann Launch Nonprofit],  ''[[Politico]]'' (May 13, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Both were formerly part of the watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW): Weismann was the group's chief counsel for ten years and Mayberg was the group's former chairman and founder.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Weismann is also past president of the American Society of Access Professionals and a member of the OpenTheGovernment.org steering committee.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Daniel Stevens, formerly a senior researcher at CREW, became deputy director for CfA, and in 2017 became CfA's executive director.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==Activities==
In May 2015, the CfA filed a lawsuit against the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], seeking to compel the agency to promulgate a regulation requiring corporations to disclose their political contributions that would inform investors how corporations are spending their money.&lt;ref name="New"/&gt; The CfA acted on behalf of Stephen Silberstein, a shareholder of [[Aetna Inc.]] who had unsuccessfully sought to gain information on the company's political contributions.&lt;ref name="StempelSEC"&gt;Jonathan Stempel, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-politics-idUSKBN0UI1XU20160104 SEC not required to make firms disclose political contributions: judge], Reuters (January 5, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Judge [[Rosemary M. Collyer]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] dismissed the suit, ruling that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that SEC had a "clear legal duty" to open a rulemaking proceeding or that its failure to do so was [[arbitrary and capricious]].&lt;ref name="StempelSEC"/&gt;

In November 2015, the CfA asked the [[Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] and the [[Federal Election Commission]] to get to the bottom of allegations that the [[Macau casino]] operations of [[Sheldon Adelson]]'s [[Las Vegas Sands Corp.]] are tied to organized crime.&lt;ref name="Arnesdorf"&gt;Isaak Arnesdorf, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/sheldon-adelson-casinos-campaign-finance-215427 Group asks for probe of Adelson contributions]; ''[[Politico]]'' (November 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann said that "Given the extent to which Mr. Adelson's wealth derives from Macau and his dominant role in funding Republican candidates, it seems highly likely that illegal foreign money has made its way into American elections." A spokesman for the Las Vegas Sands Corp. denied the allegations,&lt;ref name="Arnesdorf"/&gt; and the CfA subsequently issued a retraction of its statement, saying: "The available evidence supports further investigation into these alleged matters but does not support the statements made by CfA outside of its filings" with the Senate committee and the FEC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-regarding-sheldon-adelson-300184186.html Statement Regarding Sheldon Adelson] (press release), Campaign for Accountability (November 24, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the CfA asked the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] to investigate [[David H. Stevens]], the chief executive of the [[Mortgage Bankers Association]] and the former commissioner of the [[Federal Housing Administration]], for possible violations of "[[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]" ethics laws. The [[National Legal and Policy Center]] joined this call several months later.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Morgenson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/business/ethics-group-urges-inquiry-of-mortgage-banking-lobbyist-who-led-fha.html Ethics Group Urges Inquiry of Mortgage Banking Lobbyist Who Led F.H.A.], ''New York Times'' (February 29, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Megan R.

In January 2016, the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] published a report showing that the largest contributors to the campaigns of Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, were the tenants of a commercial building that the senator owns in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].  Stevens of CfA said that a tenant's ties to Corker raise questions on whether it was paying [[fair market value]] in rent.&lt;ref name="TuckerCorkerTenants"/&gt; Separately, the CfA filed ethics complaints against Corker with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|U.S. Senate Ethics Committee]], accusing him of [[insider trading]] in three particular [[hedge fund]]s.&lt;ref name="SherEthics"/&gt; Corker denied the allegations, calling them "categorically false" and "baseless."&lt;ref name="SherEthics"/&gt;

In March 2016, the CfA made a request to [[Kim Davis]]&amp;mdash;the controversial [[county clerk]] of [[Rowan County, Kentucky]], who had gained international attention the previous year after defying a [[United States federal court|federal court]] order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples&amp;mdash;for access to [[public records]] under the Kentucky Open Records Act. The CfA specifically sought copies of [[retainer agreement]]s and lawyer-client engagement agreements between Davis and [[Liberty Counsel]], the religious advocacy organization that represented Davis in the marriage-license dispute.&lt;ref name="ChevesOpenRecordsAct"&gt;John Cheves, [http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article87724492.html Kim Davis violated Open Records Act, attorney general says], ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' (July 5, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watkins"&gt;Morgan Watkins, [http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/05/ag-opinion-kim-davis-violated-open-records-act/86723282/ AG opinion: Kim Davis violated Open Records Act], ''Courier-Journal'' (Louisville, Ky.)

In April 2016, the Campaign for Accountability launched the [[Google]] Transparency Project, a website on Google's "influence on government, public policies, and our lives."&lt;ref name="gtp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign for Accountability Launches Google Transparency Project|url=http://campaignforaccountability.org/campaign-for-accountability-launches-google-transparency-project/|website=Campaign for Accountability|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Funding for the project, and for the Campaign, was not disclosed, but in August 2016 Ken Glueck of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] confirmed that Oracle, who had been conducting a [[Oracle America, Inc. v.

In March 2017, CfA and other groups asked Oregon Attorney General [[Ellen Rosenblum]] to investigate solar panel sales practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/31/solar-group-wants-oregon-ag-to-investigate-sales-p/|title=Solar: Group wants Oregon AG to investigate sales practices|last=|first=|date=2017-03-31|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2017/03/consumer_group_asks_state_to_i.html|title=Consumer group asks state to investigate solar companies' sales practices|last=Sickinger|first=Ted|date=2017-03-30|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based [[SolarCity]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The organization reviewed 58 consumer complaints and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A spokesman for CfA said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2017, CfA filed a complaint with the [[U.S. Attorney's Office]] for the Western District of Missouri, calling for a [[federal grand jury]] investigation into [[Missouri State Senate]] President Pro Tem [[Ron Richard]]'s acceptance of a $100,000 campaign contribution from a [[Joplin, Missouri]] businessman, six days after introducing a bill "that would have affected a lawsuit against that donor's company" by restricting the ability of plaintiffs to sue under Missouri's consumer protection law.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;Jason Hancock, [http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article145535729.html Watchdog group calls for investigation of Missouri Senate leader Ron Richard], ''Kansas City Star'' (April 19, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Both Richard and the contributor denied wrongdoing, saying that the allegation of [[pay to play]] was false.&lt;ref name="Hancock"/&gt;

On May 2017, CfA filed a complaint with the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]], asking the office to open an investigation into whether U.S. Representative [[Rodney Frelinghuysen]], Republican of [[New Jersey]], the chair of the [[House Appropriations Committee]], violated House ethics rules. The complaint involved a campaign fundraising letter that Frelinghuysen had written to a bank board member in which he criticized a progressive activist who was employed by the bank; Frelinghuysen added a handwritten note to the letter: "P.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20417">{{For|the accountancy use of the term|Capital account (financial accounting)}}

In [[macroeconomics]] and international finance, the '''capital account''' (also known as the '''financial account''') is one of two primary components of the [[balance of payments]], the other being the [[current account]]. Whereas the current account reflects a nation's net income, the capital account reflects net change in ownership of national assets.

A surplus in the capital account means money is flowing into the country, but unlike a surplus in the current account, the inbound flows effectively represent borrowings or sales of assets rather than payment for work. A deficit in the capital account means money is flowing out of the country, and it suggests the nation is increasing its ownership of foreign assets.

The term "capital account" is used with a narrower meaning by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and affiliated sources. The IMF splits what the rest of the world calls the capital account into two top-level divisions: ''financial account'' and ''capital account'', with by far the bulk of the transactions being recorded in its financial account.

==Definitions==
At high level:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mbox{Capital account} &amp; = \mbox{Change in foreign ownership of domestic assets} \\
   &amp; - \mbox{Change in domestic ownership of foreign assets} \\
   
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Breaking this down:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mbox{Capital account} &amp; = \mbox{Foreign direct investment} \\
   &amp; + \mbox{Portfolio investment} \\
   &amp; + \mbox{Other investment} \\
   &amp; + \mbox{Reserve account} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Two International Finance Centre.jpg|thumb|right| The [[International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)|International Finance Centre]] in Hong Kong, where many capital account transactions are processed.]]

* [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) refers to long-term capital investment, such as the purchase or construction of machinery, buildings, or whole manufacturing plants. If foreigners are investing in a country, that represents an inbound flow and counts as a surplus item on the capital account. If a nation's citizens are investing in foreign countries, that represents an outbound flow and counts as a deficit. After the initial investment, any yearly profits that are not reinvested will flow in the opposite direction but will be recorded in the current account rather than as capital.&lt;ref name = "sloman"&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher=Penguin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Portfolio investment]] refers to the purchase of shares and bonds. It is sometimes grouped together with "other" as short-term investment. As with FDI, the income derived from these assets is recorded in the current account; the capital account entry will just be for any buying or selling of the portfolio assets in the international [[capital markets]].&lt;ref name = "sloman"/&gt;
* ''Other investment'' includes capital flows into bank accounts or provided as loans. Large short-term flows between accounts in different nations commonly occur when the market can take advantage of fluctuations in interest rates and/or the exchange rate between currencies. Sometimes this category can include the ''reserve account''.&lt;ref name = "sloman"/&gt; 
* ''Reserve account''. The reserve account is operated by a nation's [[central bank]] to buy and sell foreign currencies; it can be a source of large capital flows to counteract those originating from the market. Inbound capital flows (from sales of the nation's foreign currency), especially when combined with a current account surplus, can cause a rise in value ([[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]]) of a nation's currency, while outbound flows can cause a fall in value (depreciation). If a government (or, if authorized to operate independently in this area, the central bank itself) does not consider the market-driven change to its currency value to be in the nation's best interests, it can intervene.&lt;ref name = "IFM"&gt;{{cite book

===Central bank operations and the reserve account===
Conventionally, central banks have two principal tools to influence the value of their nation's currency: raising or lowering the base rate of interest and, more effectively, buying or selling their currency. Setting a higher interest rate than other major central banks will tend to attract funds via the nation's capital account, and this will act to raise the value of its currency. A relatively low interest rate will have the opposite effect. Since World War II, interest rates have largely been set with a view to the needs of the domestic economy, and moreover, changing the interest rate alone has only a limited effect.&lt;ref name = "Wilmott"&gt;{{cite book

A nation's ability to prevent a fall in the value of its own currency is limited mainly by the size of its foreign reserves: it needs to use the reserves to buy back its currency.&lt;ref&gt;By the law of supply and demand, reducing the supply of currency available by buying up large quantities on the forex markets tends to raise the price.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2013, a trend has developed for some central banks to attempt to exert upward pressure on their currencies by means of [[currency swap]]s rather than by directly selling their foreign reserves.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of foreign reserves, central banks may affect international pricing indirectly by selling assets (usually government bonds) domestically, which, however, diminishes liquidity in the economy and may lead to deflation.

When a currency rises higher than monetary authorities might like (making exports less competitive internationally), it is usually considered relatively easy for an independent central bank to counter this. By buying foreign currency or foreign financial assets (usually other governments' bonds), the central bank has a ready means to lower the value of its own currency; if it needs to, it can always create more of its own currency to fund these purchases. The risk, however, is general price inflation. The term "printing money" is often used to describe such monetization, but is an anachronism, since most money exists in the form of deposits and its supply is manipulated through the purchase of bonds. A third mechanism that central banks and governments can use to raise or lower the value of their currency is simply to talk it up or down, by hinting at future action that may discourage speculators. [[Quantitative easing]], a practice used by major central banks in 2009, consisted of large-scale bond purchases by central banks. The desire was to stabilize banking systems and, if possible, encourage investment to reduce unemployment. 
  
As an example of direct intervention to manage currency valuation, in the 20th century Great Britain's central bank, the [[Bank of England]], would sometimes use its reserves to buy large amounts of pound sterling to prevent it falling in value. [[Black Wednesday]] was a case where it had insufficient reserves of foreign currency to do this successfully. Conversely, in the early 21st century, several major emerging economies effectively sold large amounts of their currencies in order to prevent their value rising, and in the process built up large reserves of foreign currency, principally the US dollar.&lt;ref name = "wolf"&gt;{{cite book

Sometimes the reserve account is classified as "below the line" and thus not reported as part of the capital account.&lt;ref name = "IFM"/&gt; Flows to or from the reserve account can substantially affect the overall capital account. Taking the example of China in the early 21st century, and excluding the activity of its central bank, China's capital account had a large surplus, as it had been the recipient of much foreign investment. If the reserve account is included, however, China's capital account has been in large deficit, as its central bank purchased large amounts of foreign assets (chiefly US government bonds) to a degree sufficient to offset not just the rest of the capital account, but its large current account surplus as well.&lt;ref name = "wolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, in late 2011 China also had periods when it was selling foreign reserves to prevent depreciation, this was due to surges of funds leaving the country through the private sector component of the capital account.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sterilization====
{{Main|Sterilization (economics)}}
In the financial literature, ''sterilization'' is a term commonly used to refer to operations of a central bank that mitigate the potentially undesirable effects of inbound capital: currency appreciation and inflation. Depending on the source, sterilization can mean the relatively straightforward recycling of inbound capital to prevent currency appreciation and/or a range of measures to check the inflationary impact of inbound capital. The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use [[open market operations]] where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy.&lt;ref&gt;

|date=1999-01-02
|author1=Sweta C. Saxena |author2=Kar-yiu Wong |publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=[[European Central Bank|ECB]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization.

===International Monetary Fund===
The above definition is the one most widely used in economic literature,&lt;ref&gt;Though with a few exceptions, e.g. ''International economics'' by Krugman and Obstfeld which uses the IMF definition in at least its 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; in the financial press, by corporate and government analysts (except when they are reporting to the IMF), and by the [[World Bank]]. In contrast, what the rest of the world calls the capital account is labelled the "financial account" by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and by the [[United Nations System of National Accounts]] (SNA). In the IMF's definition, the capital account represents a small subset of what the standard definition designates the capital account, largely comprising transfers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heakal"/&gt; Transfers are one-way flows, such as gifts, as opposed to commercial exchanges (i.e., buying/selling and barter). The largest type of transfer between nations is typically foreign aid, but that is mostly recorded in the current account. An exception is [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]], which in a sense is the transfer of ownership of an asset. When a country receives significant debt forgiveness, that will typically comprise the bulk of its overall IMF capital account entry for that year.

The IMF's capital account does include some non-transfer flows, which are sales involving non-financial and non-produced assets—for example, natural resources like land, leases and licenses, and marketing assets such as brands—but the sums involved are typically very small, as most movement in these items occurs when both seller and buyer are of the same nationality.

Transfers apart from debt forgiveness recorded in the IMF's capital account include the transfer of goods and financial assets by migrants leaving or entering a country, the transfer of ownership on fixed assets, the transfer of funds received to the sale or acquisition of fixed assets, gift and inheritance taxes, death levies, and uninsured damage to [[fixed asset]]s.&lt;ref name = "IMFmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heakal"/&gt; In a non-IMF representation, these items might be grouped in the "other" subtotal of the capital account. They typically amount to a very small amount in comparison to loans and flows into and out of short-term bank accounts.

==Capital controls==
{{Main|Capital control}}
Capital controls are measures imposed by a state's government aimed at managing capital account transactions. They include outright prohibitions against some or all capital account transactions, [[Financial transaction tax|transaction taxes]] on the international sale of specific financial assets, or caps on the size of international sales and purchases of specific financial assets. While usually aimed  at the financial sector, controls can affect ordinary citizens, for example in the 1960s British families  were at one point restricted from taking more than £50 with them out of the country for their foreign holidays.&lt;ref name = "wolf"/&gt;  Countries without capital controls that limit the buying and selling of their currency at market rates are said to have full [[capital account convertibility]].

Following the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] agreement established at the close of World War II,  most nations put in place capital controls to prevent large flows either into or out of their capital account.  [[John Maynard Keynes]], one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, considered capital controls to be a permanent part of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Both advanced and emerging nations adopted controls;  in basic theory it may be supposed that large inbound investments will speed an emerging economy's development, but empirical evidence suggests this does not reliably occur, and in fact large capital inflows can hurt a nation's economic development by causing its currency to appreciate, by contributing to inflation, and by causing an unsustainable "bubble" of economic activity that often precedes financial crisis. The inflows sharply reverse once [[capital flight]] takes places after the crisis occurs.&lt;ref name = "Heakal"&gt;

As part of the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in favour of free market orientated policies,  countries began abolishing their capital controls, starting between 1973–74 with the US, Canada, Germany and Switzerland  and followed by Great Britain in 1979.&lt;ref name = "inside"&gt;{{cite book

A '''chief visibility officer ''' ('''CVO''') or director of visibility is an individual appointed to oversee all aspects of performance across [[retail]] stores, [[corporations]] or organizations as part of the [[C-Suite]] of executives. The role of the CVO emerged to manage the integration of ideas, disciplines, technologies and people focused on elevating retail enterprise visibility. The title is commonly associated with [[Retail Loss Prevention]] (LP) leaders and professionals who maintain the highest position in security management and maintain the security operations in the store to achieve a high level of visibility.

==Role==
The CVO is focused on security systems as they contribute to higher profits and elevated store performance levels. The importance of the CVO position has risen as criminals and [[organized retail crime]] grows more sophisticated in thwarting security solutions.  According to the Centre for Retail Research Global Retail Theft Barometer 2011 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retailresearch.org/grtb_currentsurvey.php|title=The First Worldwide Shrinkage Survey 2011|publisher=Centre for Retail Research|year=2011 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total global shrink in 2011 cost retailers $119.092 billion, an average of 1.45% of global retail sales. The shrinkage rate was an average of 6.6% higher than 2010.   The losses are said to cost each family $199.89 per that year.   Working with security integrators to achieve maximum visibility into what takes place in a retail store on a daily basis allows the CVO to impact not only shrinkage numbers, but also to improve store operations. This approach was cited by the University of Leicester study on Effective Retail Loss Prevention, 10 Ways to Keep Shrinkage Low  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology/people/bna/10WaystoKeepShrinkageLowpdf |title=Effective Retail Loss Prevention, 10 Ways to Keep Shrinkage Low|year=2007 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was noted that among the keys to reducing shrinkage in an organization included establishing a senior management commitment, ensuring organisational ownership, embedding loss prevention into the business and providing strong leadership.

==Challenges==
Shrinkage can occur in a number of different areas for a retailer: employee theft, including [[sweethearting]] [[shoplifting]]/organized retail crime, administrative error and vendor fraud.{{Cn|date=July 2016}} The goal of a CVO is to maximize business profits by reducing losses.{{Cn|date=July 2016}}  To accomplish this objective, CVOs analyze the full spectrum of store operations from employee and customer behavior to vendor and supplier patterns and supply chains.{{Cn|date=July 2016}} Integrated technologies can provide a comprehensive picture of customer behavior, staffing needs and merchandising trends, in addition to preventing losses for the store.{{Cn|date=July 2016}} The CVO must be in touch with core challenges across an organization to implement and integrate security solutions tailored to protect its unique vulnerabilities. According to securitysales.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Go Time In Retail |publisher=Security Sales and Integration |date=July 2, 2013 |url=http://www.securitysales.com/channel/vertical-markets/articles/2013/07/it-s-go-time-in-retail.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021232221/http://www.securitysales.com/channel/vertical-markets/articles/2013/07/it-s-go-time-in-retail.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; retailers are looking beyond standalone technology like [[electronic article surveillance]] (EAS) systems or cameras and access control and aiming to have visibility across the demand and supply chain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1007">{{Unreferenced|date=June 2018}} A '''computer bureau''' is a [[service bureau]] providing computer services.

Computer bureaus developed during the early 1960s, following the development of [[time-sharing]] operating systems. These allowed the services of a single large and expensive [[mainframe]] computer to be divided up and sold as a [[fungible]] commodity. Development of telecommunications and the first [[modem]]s encouraged the growth of computer bureau as they allowed immediate access to the computer facilities from a customer's own premises.

The computer bureau model shrank during the 1980s, as cheap commodity computers, particularly the [[PC compatible|PC clone]] but also the [[minicomputer]] allowed services to be hosted [[on-premises hosting|on-premises]].

In 1988, when he was part of Funes, Straschnoy &amp; Dreyfus agency, he partnered with the multinational agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] and assumed the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apertura.com/target/Dario-Straschnoy-Una-usina-creativa-exige-ser-coherente-todos-los-dias-20130322-0005.html Carla Quiroga, 'Darío Straschnoy: 'Una usina creativa exige ser coherente todos los días'', ''Apertura Magazine'', 03/22/2013] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, in 2000, the company was bought and absorbed by [[WPP plc|WPP]], one of the largest groups of communication services worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/17854-young-rubicam-numero-uno-en-el-pais-y-en-el-mundo Alberto Borrini, 'Young &amp; Rubicam, número uno en el país y en el mundo', ''La Nación newspaper'', 05/23/2000] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Young &amp; Rubicam]], one of the largest advertising agencies in the world, was founded in [[Philadelphia]] in 1923 and currently has 465 offices in 90 countries.

The agency came to Argentina in 1979 and Darío Straschnoy was the President from 1988 until the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cronista.com/negocios/-Dario-Straschnoy-se-aleja-de-YampR-tras-mas-de-25-anos-al-frente-de-la-agencia-20131211-0099.html ''Cronista.com'', 'Darío Straschnoy se aleja de Y&amp;R tras más de 25 años al frente de la agencia', 12/11/2013] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustavs Ērenpreis''' (5 September 1891 – 19 May 1956) was a Latvian-born manufacturer of [[bicycles]] best known as recipient of the [[Order of the Three Stars]] and [[Cross of Recognition]], and as a founder and director of [[Gustavs Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory]], which in the 1930s was the largest manufacturer of bicycles in the Baltic states. Ērenpreis's bicycles were ridden by a generation of elite bicycle racers in [[Latvia]].

== Personal life ==
Gustavs Ērenpreis was the son of [[Mazsalaca Manor|Valtenberģi Manor]] coachman Lībijs and Anna. He was born in Vatenberģi (today, Mazsalaca city), [[Latvia]] which at that time was in the [[Russian Empire]].  Ērenpreis was educated at a trade school in [[Riga]].&lt;br /&gt;
He was married twice and had one child from the first marriage - a son Jānis, and four children from the second marriage - a son Juris and three daughters - Anita, Maija and Sarmīte.&lt;ref&gt;''Being happy for success of the relative/ Ar prieku par radinieka veikumu''. Interview with the son of Gustavs Ērenpreis, Andris Tiļļa. Latvijas Avīze, 17 April 2012, p. 5. Retrieved 08 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustavs Ērenpreis was decorated with the [[Order of the Three Stars]] medal,&lt;ref&gt;''Recipients of the Order of the Three Stars''/ "Ar Triju zvaigžņu ordeni apbalvoto saraksts" (17 November 1937). Government Gazette/ Valdības Vēstnesis, Nr. 262, published Rīgā, castle nr.2, pp. 2. Retrieved 04 December 2015.

After the nationalization of the bicycle USSR, Gustavs emigrated to West Germany where he worked in sawmill.&lt;ref name=FromLtoE&gt;Liepiņš Edvīns and Seregins Jānis, ''From Leutner to Erenpreis: 100 Years of Bicycle Manufacturing in Latvia''. Industrial Heritage Trust of Latvia, 2009; pp. 99-107. {{ISBN|9789934805004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never returned to his homeland Latvia and died after an illness in [[Detmold]], [[Germany]]. He was buried in [[Augsdorf]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foreigner Latvians/ Latvieši pasaulē'' (14 July 1956). The Australian Latvian, Nr.344, pp. 2. Retrieved 04 December 2015. List available in [http://www.periodika.lv/ periodika.lndb.lv] - Latvian National Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After graduation of trade school in Riga, in 1907 he worked at the Eduards Bērziņš bicycle workshop in [[Riga]], which produced bicycles and repaired and sold English [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] and [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycles in the [[Baltic states]]. During [[World War I]] he was evacuated with the workshop to [[Harkov]]. After the war the workshop equipment could not be recovered, and Gustavs had to return to Riga, Latvia without any equipment.

In 1921, following the end of the war,  Ērenpreis launched his own workshop, where in early years he repaired and sold abandoned [[military transport]]s of the [[West Russian Volunteer Army|Bermont army]].&lt;ref name=FromLtoE /&gt; He moved into manufacturing the following year as the "G. Ērenpreis Motorcycle and Bicycle Workshop", where he first manufactured his own bicycles under the "Baltija" label.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt;

Due to rapid expansion, the limited space in his workshop had become a problem, and in 1924 the Ērenpreis workshop moved to a larger space.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt; In 1926 Gustavs Ērenpreis and his business partners established a [[joint-stock company]] called Omega, but this entity was ultimately abandoned that same year.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt;

=== G. Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory ===
Those first manufacturing efforts were preliminary to the actual establishment of a new manufacturing entity called the G. Ērenpreis Bicycle Factory in 1927. The new firm continued in its previous quarters until, in 1931, construction began on a new, modern bicycle factory located on in Brīvības Street.&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt; 
Janis Seregins, the biggest bicycle collection owner in Baltics and the author of historic review of Latvian bicycle history "100 year of bicycle manufacturing in Latvia. From Leutner to Erenpreis" points out that by 1937 the factory had become the largest manufacturer of bicycles in the Baltic states.&lt;ref name=FromLtoE /&gt;

In addition to being the largest Latvian bicycle manufacture of its day, the G. Ērenpreis bicycle factory was regarded as the source of the highest quality bikes for Latvian competitive cyclists.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/sports/news/tautassports/news/latvijas-ritenbrauceju-vienibas-brauciens-toreiz-un-tagad.d?id=39999993 "Vienības brauciens – toreiz un tagad" (The Unity Ride - then and now)], the story of historic bicycle race in Latvia. Delfi, August 8, 2011. Accessed: February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; G. Ērenpreis bicycles were ridden by the top Latvian cyclists of the era, including [[Olympic games|Olympic]] cyclists [[Arvīds Immermanis]] and [[Andrejs Apsītis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://olimpiade.lv/lv/latvijas-olimpiesi/arvids-immermanis-231?ref=%3Fq%3Dimmermanis Arvīds Immermanis - Latvian Olympic], Official home page of [[Latvian Olympic Committee]]. Accessed February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationalization of factory and legacy ===

Unfortunately, [[World War II]] and the [[occupation of Latvia]] halted G. Ērenpreis bicycle factory work. The Ērenpreis company was [[nationalization|nationalized]] by the USSR and renamed the "Red Star Riga Bicycle Factory" (Rīgas Velosipēdu rūpnīca (RVR) "Sarkanā Zvaigzne"). Bicycle production continued at that company until 1963, when the factory was retooled and converted to the production of [[mopeds]].&lt;ref name="FromLtoE"/&gt; Today G. Ērenpreis bicycles are exhibited at the [[Riga Motor Museum]] as part of the country's industrial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motormuzejs.lv/pub/index.php?lang=eng&amp;id=243 Made in Latvia - automobiles, bicycles and mopeds], www.motormuzejs.lv. Accessed 04 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2011, Gustavs hometown Mazsalaca has celebrated Gustavs Ērenpreis birthday in the festival "Velosvētki - Ērenpreisam 124" (bicycle festival - Ērenpreiss - 124 years old!")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mazsalaca.lv/index.php?zoomzina=362&amp;title=Velosv%C4%93tki+%26%2334%3B%C4%92renpreisam+124%26%2334%3B Velosvētki "Ērenpreisam 124"]. 20 June 2015. Accessed 04 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the brand was revived by Gustavs Ērenpreis' great grandnephew, Toms Ērenpreiss, who manufactures new [[Ērenpreiss Bicycles|Ērenpreiss bicycles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/may/06/the-bike-brand-that-helped-latvia-rediscover-its-cycling-heritage ''The bike brand that helped Latvia rediscover its cycling heritage''] by Emily Chappell, 06 May 2015.

==Business interests==
The Huljich brothers (Chris, Paul and Michael), founded a food manufacturing business, at first under the name Top Hat Bacon, in the 1980s&lt;ref name="NBRRichList2010"&gt;The National Business Review, ''Rich List'', Auckland, 2010, p. 45 (published as an annex to ''The National Business Review'', 30 July 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; specialising in various pork products or [[Charcuterie|small goods]] (e.g. processed meats bought from a delicatessen, such as [[bacon]], [[sausages]], [[pâté]] and [[salami]]). This enterprise grew into the Best Corporation (a major brand continued to be "Top Hat Bacon") which operated an important segment of the market in New Zealand and owned considerable assets in Australia.&lt;ref name="Eldred-Grigg"&gt;Stevan Eldred-Grigg, ''The Rich: A New Zealand History'', Penguin Books, Auckland, 1996, pp. 216 and 217&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s the three brothers sold Best Corporation to French food company [[Groupe Danone]] and also sold valuable Australian assets.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Rotherham, "Huljichs' Sydney bail-out signals return to bacon makin'", ''The Independent'',  16 December 1998, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the sale of Best Corporation, the three  brothers separately invested their proceeds into different  interests:

Christopher Huljich and his son Peter founded [[Huljich Wealth Management (NZ) Ltd|Huljich Wealth Management (NZ)]]  in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Social-page favourite has fans and critics in business world|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10628755|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2010-02-27|access-date = 2016-01-04|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ|first = Tamsyn|last = Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt; This business was sold for $20.9m NZX to Fisher Funds Limited in 2011 after a period of fast growth in the business led to lapses in investment management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Huljich KiwiSaver price revealed - $20.9m|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10781557|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2012-01-27|access-date = 2016-01-04|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was subsequently prosecuted by the Securities Commission and fined $239,000 plus $95,265 in legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Huljich hit with fine over Kiwisaver|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/6166748/Huljich-hit-with-fine-over-Kiwisaver|newspaper = Stuff.co.nz|date = 2011-12-20|access-date = 2016-01-08|first = William|last = Mace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Huljich]] has authored a number of fiction and non-fiction books, which chronicle his battle with depression and stress. These books include a novel loosely based on his experiences with mental illness and his subsequent drug-free recovery, called "Betrayal of Love and Freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1|title = Betrayal of Love and Freedom|url = https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Love-Freedom-Paul-Huljich/dp/0615368174|publisher = Mwella Publishing|date = 2010-05-01|location = United States|isbn = 9780615368177|first = Paul|last = Huljich}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now lectures worldwide on curing and mitigating against the effects of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress Pandemic by Paul Huljich - Two USA Best Book Golds {{!}} Scoop News|url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1411/S00447/stress-pandemic-by-paul-huljich-two-usa-best-book-golds.htm|website = www.scoop.co.nz|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Huljich (son of Paul) has produced a number of children’s movies loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson book “Treasure Island”. These films starred US actor [[Randy Quaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Family adventure trilogy filming around Auckland {{!}} Scoop News|url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0312/S00020.htm|website = www.scoop.co.nz|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mark Huljich|url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1367171/|website = IMDb|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher and Peter Huljich have invested (via their private equity business Christopher and Banks Limited ([[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks (managing partner)]] and Chris Hulich (partner)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=216838336 ''Bloomberg''] (retrieved 26 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;), in a number of business startups and established technology businesses&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt; including "[[Pushpay]]" which facilitates donations to charitable organisations and of which Chris Huljich is a director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pushpay.com/investors/board Pushpay Board of Directors] (retrieved 26 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
The   family have created the Huljich Foundation, a charitable trust that supports seriously ill children. The trust provides a memorable experience for children with a poor prognosis. The experience is to be chosen by the child to share the experience with their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Child Cancer Foundation - Thank you to the Huljich Foundation|url = http://childcancer.org.nz/News-and-events/News/Thank-you-to-the-Huljich-Foundation.aspx|website = childcancer.org.nz|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family discord==
In 2014 it was reported that Elizabeth, the mother of brothers Christopher, Paul and Michael, had filed an application in the High Court at Auckland to force her son Christopher to repay a mortgage registered over her St Heliers property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Rich-list money feud: Mother v son|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11355212|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2014-11-08|access-date = 2016-01-04|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defended the action, stating that the claim was misconceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Huljich family feud gets April High Court date|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11367538|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2014-12-02|access-date = 2016-01-04|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim, which has been widened, and to which her grandson Peter Huljich and son Michael Huljich have been added as defendants, has been the subject of continuous court action and is heading for trial in July 2018.&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt;  As a separate matter, Paul Huljich is suing his two brothers, Christopher and Michael Huljich, and his nephew, Peter Huljich, over the distribution of family assets.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie Smith, "Paul Huljich seeks bank records as family dispute deepens", ''NBR'', 29 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Human Genome Project''' ('''HGP''') was an international [[scientific research]] project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide [[base pairs]] that make up human [[DNA]], and of identifying and mapping all of the [[gene]]s of the [[human genome]] from both a physical and  a functional standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Robert Krulwich]] |date=2003 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/ |title=Cracking the Code of Life |medium=Television Show |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://battelle.org/docs/default-document-library/economic_impact_of_the_human_genome_project.pdf|title= Economic Impact of the Human Genome Project – Battelle| accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete on April 14, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/11006943/human-genome-project-completion-frequently-asked-questions/|title=Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions|author=|date=|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Funding came from the US government through the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the [[Celera Corporation]], or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Spain and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/11006943| title=Human Genome Project Completion: Frequently Asked Questions|work=genome.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the [[nucleotides]] contained in a human [[haploid]] [[reference genome]] (more than three billion).  The "genome" of any given individual is unique; mapping the "human genome" involved sequencing a small number of individuals and then assembling these together to get a complete sequence for each chromosome. Therefore, the finished human genome is a mosaic, not representing any one individual.

=== History ===
[[File:Dna-split.png|right]]
The Human Genome Project was a 15-year-long, publicly funded project initiated in 1990 with the objective of determining the DNA sequence of the entire euchromatic human genome within 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human Genome Project: Sequencing the Human Genome {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-sequencing-technologies-key-to-the-human-828|website = www.nature.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1985, Robert Sinsheimer organized a workshop to discuss sequencing the human genome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinsheimer|first1=Robert|title=The Santa Cruz Workshop, May 1985|journal=Genomics|date=1989|volume=5|issue=4|pages=954–956|doi=10.1016/0888-7543(89)90142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for a number of reasons the NIH was uninterested in pursuing the proposal. The following March, the Santa Fe Workshop was organized by [[Charles DeLisi]] and David Smith of the Department of Energy's Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeLisi|first1=Charles|title=Conferences That Changed the World|journal=Nature|date=October 2008|pages=876–877|doi=10.1038/455876a|bibcode=2008Natur.455..876D|volume=455|issue=7215|pmid=18923499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time [[Renato Dulbecco]] proposed whole genome sequencing in an essay in Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dulbecco|first1=Renato|title=Turning Point in Cancer Research, Sequencing the Human Genome|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=231|pages=1055–1056|doi=10.1126/science.3945817|pmid=3945817|issue=4742|bibcode=1986Sci...231.1055D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Watson followed two months later with a workshop held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The fact that the Santa Fe workshop was motivated and supported by a Federal Agency opened a path, albeit a difficult and tortuous one,&lt;ref name="Cook-Deegan"&gt;Gene Wars, Op.Cit. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; for converting the idea into a public policy in the [[United States]].  In a memo to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Research (Alvin Trivelpiece), Charles DeLisi, who was then Director of the OHER, outlined a broad plan for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/556935/discover?filtertype=author&amp;filter_relational_operator=equals&amp;filter=DeLisi%2C+Charles|title=Search|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This started a long and complex chain of events which led to approved reprogramming of funds that enabled the OHER to launch the Project in 1986, and to recommend the first line item for the HGP, which was in President Reagan's 1988 budget submission,&lt;ref name="Cook-Deegan" /&gt; and ultimately approved by the Congress.  Of particular importance in Congressional approval was the advocacy of Senator [[Peter Domenici]], whom DeLisi had befriended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/new/html/Mon_Jan_8_141714_2001.html|title=President Clinton Awards the Presidential Citizens Medals|work=nara.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenici chaired the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the Budget Committee, both of which were key in the DOE budget process.  Congress added a comparable amount to the NIH budget, thereby beginning official funding by both agencies.

[[Alvin Trivelpiece]] sought and obtained the approval of DeLisi's proposal by  Deputy Secretary [[William Flynn Martin]]. This chart&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Trivelpiece/HGP%20Presenation.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; was used in the spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of [[John S. Herrington|Secretary Herrington]]. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million in the [[Reagan Administration]]’s 1987 budget submission to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi|first=Charles|title=Meetings that changed the world: Santa Fe 1986: Human genome baby-steps|journal=Nature|date=2008|volume=455|issue=7215|pages=876–877|bibcode = 2008Natur.455..876D |doi = 10.1038/455876a|pmid=18923499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It subsequently passed both Houses. The Project was planned for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi|first=Charles|title=The Human Genome Project|journal=American Scientist|date=1988|volume=76|issue=5|page=488|bibcode = 1988AmSci..76..488D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate technologies were already being considered for the proposed undertaking at least as early as 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLisi |first=Charles |date=2001 |url=http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v11n3/05delisi.html |title=Genomes: 15 Years Later A Perspective by Charles Deli, HEP Pioneer |journal=Human Genome News |volume=11 |pages=3–4 |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904183906/http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v11n3/05delisi.html |archivedate=September 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the two major funding agencies, DOE and [[NIH]], developed a memorandum of understanding in order to coordinate plans and set the clock for the initiation of the Project to 1990.&lt;ref name=hgmis&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml |title=About the Human Genome Project: What is the Human Genome Project |publisher=The Human Genome Management Information System (HGMIS) |date= 2011-07-18 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, David Galas was Director of the renamed “Office of Biological and Environmental Research” in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and [[James Watson]] headed the NIH Genome Program. In 1993, Aristides Patrinos succeeded Galas and [[Francis Collins]] succeeded [[James Watson]], assuming the role of overall Project Head as Director of the [[United States National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) National Center for Human Genome Research (which would later become the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]]). A working draft of the genome was announced in 2000 and the papers describing it were published in February 2001. A more complete draft was published in 2003, and genome "finishing" work continued for more than a decade.

The $3-billion project was formally founded in 1990 by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, and was expected to take 15 years.&lt;ref name=human&gt;{{cite web|author = Human Genome Information Archive|url= http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml|title= About the Human Genome Project| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy &amp; Human Genome Project program | accessdate=1  August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the United States, the international [[consortium]] comprised [[geneticist]]s in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, China and myriad other spontaneous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Collins F|author2= Galas D |url=http://www.genome.gov/10001476 |title=A New Five-Year Plan for the United States: Human Genome Program|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute |date=1993-10-01 | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the inflation, the project roughly costed $5 billion.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07323-y|title=Life on Earth to have its DNA analysed in the name of conservation|date=6 November 2018|publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=3 December 2018|volume=563|pages=155–156|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-07323-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewin|first1=Harris A.|last2=et al.|title=Earth BioGenome Project: Sequencing life for the future of life|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4325|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|date=2018|volume=115|pages=4325–4333|doi=10.1073/pnas.1720115115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to widespread international cooperation and advances in the field of [[genomics]] (especially in [[sequence analysis]]), as well as major advances in computing technology, a 'rough draft' of the genome was finished in 2000 (announced jointly by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] on June 26, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/clinton1.shtml |title=White House Press Release |accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first available rough draft [[Genome Project|assembly]] of the genome was completed by the Genome Bioinformatics Group at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], primarily led by then graduate student [[Jim Kent]]. Ongoing [[sequencing]] led to the announcement of the essentially complete [[genome]] on April 14, 2003, two years earlier than planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2940601.stm |title=Human genome finally complete |accessdate=2006-07-22 |date=2003-04-14 |work=BBC News |first=Ivan |last=Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/science/the-human-genome-project-then-and-now.html|title=Human Genome, Then and Now|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=15 April 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, another milestone was passed on the way to completion of the project, when the sequence of the [[Chromosome 1 (human)|last chromosome]] was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uklatest/story/0,,-5829253,00.html |title=Guardian Unlimited &amp;#124;UK Latest &amp;#124; Human Genome Project finalised |accessdate=2006-07-22 |work=The Guardian |location=London }} {{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State of completion ===
The project was not able to sequence all the DNA found in [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|human cells]].  It sequenced only ''[[Euchromatin|euchromatic]]'' regions of the genome, which make up 92% of the human genome.  The other regions, called ''[[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]]'', are found in [[centromeres]] and [[telomeres]], and were not sequenced under the project.&lt;ref name=Genoscope&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Genome Project FAQ|url=http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/The-Human-Genome-Project.html?artsuite=1#FAQ2|website=Genoscope|publisher=Centre National de Séquençage|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Genome Project was declared complete in April 2003. An initial rough draft of the human genome was available in June 2000 and by February 2001 a working draft had been completed and published followed by the final sequencing mapping of the human genome on April 14, 2003. Although this was reported to cover 99% of the euchromatic human genome with 99.99% accuracy, a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published on May 27, 2004 indicating over 92% of sampling exceeded 99.99% accuracy which was within the intended goal.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2009, the [[Genome Reference Consortium]] (GRC) released a more accurate version of the human genome, but that still left more than 300 gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolgin|first=Elie|date=2009-12-17|title=Human genomics: The genome finishers|journal=Nature|volume=462|issue=7275|pages=843–845|doi=10.1038/462843a|issn=1476-4687|pmid=20016572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the GRC still indicated 514 gaps, most of which are annotated as "stalled" or "under investigation/review", so it seems they will not be resolved any time soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/human/issues?filters=type:gap&amp;asm=GRCh37.p13|title=Human Genome Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=Genome Reference Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and proposed benefits ==
The sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields, from [[molecular medicine]] to [[human evolution]]. The Human Genome Project, through its sequencing of the DNA, can help us understand diseases including: [[genotype|genotyping]] of specific [[virus]]es to direct appropriate treatment; identification of [[mutation]]s linked to different forms of [[cancer]]; the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects; advancement in [[forensics|forensic]] applied sciences;  [[biofuel]]s and other energy applications; [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]], [[bioprocessing]]; [[risk assessment]];  [[bioarcheology]], [[anthropology]] and [[evolution]]. Another proposed benefit is the commercial development of [[genomics]] research related to DNA based products, a multibillion-dollar industry.

The sequence of the DNA is stored in [[database]]s available to anyone on the [[Internet]]. The U.S. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (and sister organizations in Europe and Japan) house the gene sequence in a database known as [[GenBank]], along with sequences of known and hypothetical genes and proteins. Other organizations, such as the [[UCSC Genome Browser]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://genome.ucsc.edu|title= An Overview of the Human Genome Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ensembl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensembl.org|title=Ensembl Genome Browser|work=ensembl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; present additional data and annotation and powerful tools for visualizing and searching it. [[Computer program]]s have been developed to analyze the data, because the data itself is difficult to interpret without such programs.  Generally speaking, advances in genome sequencing technology have followed Moore’s Law, a concept from computer science which states that integrated circuits can increase in complexity at an exponential rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mardis|first1=E.|title=The impact of next-generation sequencing technology on genetics|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=133–41|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2007.12.007|pmid=18262675  |pmc=2680276}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the speeds at which whole genomes can be sequenced can increase at a similar rate, as was seen during the development of the above-mentioned Human Genome Project.

== Techniques and analysis ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called [[genome annotation]] and is in the domain of [[bioinformatics]]. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as [[RNA-seq]] was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the [[exons]] are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The genome published by the HGP does not represent the sequence of every individual's genome. It is the combined mosaic of a small number of anonymous donors, all of European origin. The HGP genome is a scaffold for future work in identifying differences among individuals. Subsequent projects sequenced the genomes of multiple distinct ethnic groups, though as of today there is still only one "reference genome."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Findings ===
Key findings of the draft (2001) and complete (2004) genome sequences include:

=== Accomplishment ===

[[Image:Wellcome genome bookcase.png|thumb|The first printout of the human genome to be presented as a series of books, displayed at the [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

The Human Genome Project was started in 1990 with the goal of sequencing and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a [[megaproject]] because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion [[base pair]]s. With the sequence in hand, the next step was to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.&lt;ref name=hgmis/&gt;&lt;ref name=wellcome&gt;{{cite web|author= Wellcome Sanger Institute|url= http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/hgp/|title= The Human Genome Project: a new reality|publisher= Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Genome Research Limited|accessdate= 1  August 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801231124/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/hgp/|archivedate= 2013-08-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was far too expensive at that time to think of sequencing patients’ whole genomes. So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a "shortcut", which was to look just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit. The theory behind the shortcut was that, since the major diseases are common, so too would be the genetic variants that caused them. [[Natural selection]] keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown, the theory held, but fails against variants that strike later in life, allowing them to become quite common (In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $138 million project called the [[HapMap]] to catalog the common variants in European, East Asian and African genomes).&lt;ref name=naid&gt;{{cite journal|author =Naidoo N|author2 =Pawitan Y|author3 =Soong R|author4 =Cooper DN|author5 = Ku CS |title=Human genetics and genomics a decade after the release of the draft sequence of the human genome | journal=Hum Genomics |volume= 5|issue=6 |pages= 577–622| date=2011 |pmid=22155605 |pmc=3525251 |doi=10.1186/1479-7364-5-6-577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genome was broken into smaller pieces; approximately 150,000 [[base pair]]s in length.&lt;ref name=wellcome/&gt; These pieces were then ligated into a type of vector known as "[[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s", or BACs, which are derived from bacterial chromosomes which have been genetically engineered. The vectors containing the genes can be inserted into bacteria where they are copied by the bacterial [[DNA replication]] machinery. Each of these pieces was then sequenced separately as a small [[Shotgun sequencing|"shotgun"]] project and then assembled. The larger, 150,000 base pairs go together to create chromosomes. This is known as the [[Shotgun sequencing#Hierarchical Shotgun sequencing|"hierarchical shotgun"]] approach, because the genome is first broken into relatively large chunks, which are then mapped to chromosomes before being selected for sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~edy/genome/celera.html|title=Celera: A Unique Approach to Genome Sequencing | work= ocf.berkeley.edu|date=2006|publisher=Biocomputing | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Davidson College |url= http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/shotgun.html|title=

Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and a UK charity organization, the [[Wellcome Trust]], as well as numerous other groups from around the world. The funding supported a number of large sequencing centers including those at [[Whitehead Institute]], the [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/who-we-are/sanger-institute Wellcome Sanger Institute] (then called The Sanger Centre) based at the [[Wellcome Genome Campus]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and [[Baylor College of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=human/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Human Genome Project Information Archive|url=http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/research/centers.shtml |title= U.S. &amp; International HGP Research Sites| date=2013|publisher= U.S. Department of Energy &amp; Human Genome Project | accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) served as an important channel for the involvement of developing countries in the Human Genome Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vizzini|first1=Casimiro|title=The Human Variome Project: Global Coordination in Data Sharing|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=March 19, 2015|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2015/human-variome-project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public versus private approaches ==
In 1998, a similar, privately funded quest was launched by the American researcher [[Craig Venter]], and his firm Celera Genomics. Venter was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the roughly $3 billion [[research funding|publicly funded project]]. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The sequence of the human genome|journal = Science|date = 2001-02-16|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 11181995|pages = 1304–1351|volume = 291|issue = 5507|doi = 10.1126/science.1058040|first = J.

Celera used a technique called [[whole genome shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|whole genome shotgun sequencing]], employing [[Shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|pairwise end sequencing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1995 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/088875439580219C |title=Pairwise end sequencing: a unified approach to genomic mapping and sequencing |journal=Genomics |volume=26 |pages=345–353 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(95)80219-C |pmid=7601461 |author=Roach JC |author2=Boysen C |author3=Wang K|author4=Hood L |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been used to sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.

Celera initially announced that it would seek patent protection on "only 200–300" genes, but later amended this to seeking "intellectual property protection" on "fully-characterized important structures" amounting to 100–300 targets. The firm eventually filed preliminary ("place-holder") patent applications on 6,500 whole or partial genes.
Celera also promised to publish their findings in accordance with the terms of the 1996 "[[Bermuda Principles|Bermuda Statement]]", by releasing new data annually (the HGP released its new data daily), although, unlike the publicly funded project, they would not permit free redistribution or scientific use of the data. The publicly funded competitors were compelled to release the first draft of the human genome before Celera for this reason. On July 7, 2000, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group released a first working draft on the web. The scientific community downloaded about 500 GB of information from the UCSC genome server in the first 24 hours of free and unrestricted access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering|url=http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/research/hgp_race |title=The Human Genome Project Race |publisher=Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] announced that the [[Genome|genome sequence]] could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera's stock plummeting and dragged down the [[biotechnology]]-heavy [[Nasdaq]]. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in [[market capitalization]] in two days.

Although the working draft was announced in June 2000, it was not until February 2001 that Celera and the HGP scientists published details of their drafts. Special issues of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (which published the publicly funded project's [[Academic publishing|scientific paper]])&lt;ref name="IHGSC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium |title=Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=409 |pages=860–921 |date=2001 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/pdf/409860a0.pdf |doi=10.1038/35057062 |format=PDF |pmid=11237011 |issue=6822|bibcode=2001Natur.409..860L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (which published Celera's paper&lt;ref name="Venter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venter, JC |title=The sequence of the human genome |journal=Science |volume=291 |pages=1304–1351 |date=2001 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/291/5507/1304.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1058040 |pmid=11181995 |format=PDF |issue=5507 |display-authors=1 |last2=Adams |first2=MD |last3=Myers |first3=EW |last4=Li |first4=PW |last5=Mural |first5=RJ |last6=Sutton |first6=GG |last7=Smith |first7=HO |last8=Yandell |first8=M |last9=Evans |first9=CA|last10=Holt |first10=Robert A. |last11=Gocayne |first11=Jeannine D. |last12=Amanatides |first12=Peter |last13=Ballew |first13=Richard M. |last14=Huson |first14=Daniel H. |last15=Wortman |first15=Jennifer Russo |last16=Zhang |first16=Qing |last17=Kodira |first17=Chinnappa D. |last18=Zheng |first18=Xiangqun H. |last19=Chen |first19=Lin |last20=Skupski |first20=Marian |last21=Subramanian |first21=Gangadharan |last22=Thomas |first22=Paul D. |last23=Zhang |first23=Jinghui |last24=Gabor Miklos |first24=George L. |last25=Nelson |first25=Catherine |last26=Broder |first26=Samuel |last27=Clark |first27=Andrew G. |last28=Nadeau |first28=Joe |last29=McKusick |first29=Victor A. |last30=Zinder |first30=Norton |bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V }}&lt;/ref&gt;) described the methods used to produce the draft sequence and offered analysis of the sequence.  These drafts covered about 83% of the genome (90% of the euchromatic regions with 150,000 gaps and the order and orientation of many segments not yet established).  In February 2001, at the time of the joint publications, [[News release|press releases]] announced that the project had been completed by both groups.  Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to approximately 92% of the sequence currently.

== Genome donors ==
In the IHGSC international [[Public sector|public-sector]] HGP, researchers collected blood (female) or sperm (male) samples from a large number of donors. Only a few of many collected samples were processed as DNA resources.  Thus the donor identities were protected so neither donors nor scientists could know whose DNA was sequenced. DNA clones from many different [[DNA library|libraries]] were used in the overall project, with most of those libraries being created by [[Pieter J. de Jong's]].  Much of the sequence (&gt;70%) of the [[reference genome]] produced by the public HGP came from a single anonymous male donor from [[Buffalo, New York]] ([[code name]] RP11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Osoegawa | first = Kazutoyo | date = 2001 | url = http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/483 | title =  A Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Library for Sequencing the Complete Human Genome  | journal=Genome Research | volume = 11 | pages = 483–96 | doi =  10.1101/gr.169601 | pmid =  11230172 | last2 = Mammoser | first2 = AG | last3 = Wu | first3 = C | last4 = Frengen | first4 = E | last5 = Zeng | first5 = C | last6 = Catanese | first6 = JJ | last7 = De Jong | first7 = PJ | issue = 3 | pmc = 311044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tuzun | first = E | date = 2005 | url = http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v37/n7/full/ng1562.html | title =  Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome  | journal=Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | pages = 727–737 | doi =  10.1038/ng1562 | pmid =  15895083 | issue=7 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Sharp | first2 = Andrew J | last3 = Bailey | first3 = Jeffrey A | last4 = Kaul | first4 = Rajinder | last5 = Morrison | first5 = V Anne | last6 = Pertz | first6 = Lisa M | last7 = Haugen | first7 = Eric | last8 = Hayden | first8 = Hillary | last9 = Albertson | first9 = Donna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HGP scientists used [[white blood cell]]s from the blood of two male and two female donors (randomly selected from 20 of each) – each donor yielding a separate DNA library.  One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations.  One minor technical issue is that male samples contain just over half as much DNA from the sex chromosomes (one [[X chromosome]] and one [[Y chromosome]]) compared to female samples (which contain two [[X chromosome]]s). The other 22 chromosomes (the autosomes) are the same for both sexes.

Although the main sequencing phase of the HGP has been completed, studies of DNA variation continued in the [[International HapMap Project]], whose goal was to identify patterns of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) groups (called [[haplotype]]s, or “haps”). The DNA samples for the HapMap came from a total of 270 individuals: [[Yoruba people]] in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]]; [[Japanese people]] in [[Tokyo]]; [[Han Chinese]] in [[Beijing]]; and the French [[Center for the Study of Human Polymorphisms|Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain]] (CEPH) resource, which consisted of residents of the United States having ancestry from Western and [[Northern Europe]].

In the Celera Genomics [[Private sector|private-sector]] project, DNA from five different individuals were used for sequencing.  The lead scientist of Celera Genomics at that time, Craig Venter, later acknowledged (in a public letter to the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') that his DNA was one of 21 samples in the pool, five of which were selected for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=297|page=1237|title=Not wicked, perhaps, but tacky|author=Kennedy D|pmid=12193755|doi=10.1126/science.297.5585.1237|issue=5585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2003|volume=299|pages=1183–4|title=A Part of the Human Genome Sequence|author=Venter D|pmid=12595674|doi=10.1126/science.299.5610.1183|issue=5610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a team led by [[Jonathan Rothberg]] published [[James Watson]]'s entire genome, unveiling the six-billion-nucleotide genome of a single individual for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = James Watson's genome sequenced at high speed|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080416/full/452788b.html|journal = Nature News|date = 2008-04-16|pages = 788|volume = 452|issue = 7189|doi = 10.1038/452788b|pmid = 18431822|first = Meredith|last = Wadman|bibcode = 2008Natur.452R....W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
The work on interpretation and analysis of genome data is still in its initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]]. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as [[Myriad Genetics]], started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including [[breast cancer]], [[blood clotting|hemostasis disorders]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[liver]] diseases and many others. Also, the [[etiology (medicine)|etiologies]] for [[cancer]]s, [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.&lt;ref name=naid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Gonzaga-Jauregui C|author2 = Lupski JR|author3 = Gibbs RA|title=Human genome sequencing in health and disease | journal= Annu Rev Med|volume= 63|issue=1 |pages=35–61 | date=2012 |pmid= 22248320|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-051010-162644 |pmc=3656720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tangible benefits for biologists. For example, a researcher investigating a certain form of [[cancer]] may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the [[World Wide Web]], this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, deeper understanding of the disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of [[Biological process|cellular processes]], it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest that may not have been possible without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Snyder M, Du J|author2 =Gerstein M |title=Personal genome sequencing: current approaches and challenges | journal=Genes Dev |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=423–431 | date=2012 |pmid=20194435 |doi=10.1101/gad.1864110 |pmc=2827837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues in the study of [[evolution]]. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of [[molecular biology]]; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the [[ribosome]] and [[organelle]]s, the development of [[embryo]]s with body plans, the [[vertebrate]] [[immune system]]) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the [[primate]]s, and indeed the other [[mammal]]s) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.&lt;ref name=naid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Lander ES |title= Initial impact of the sequencing of the human genome| journal=Nature |volume= 470|issue= 7333|pages=187–197 | date=2011 |pmid=21307931 |doi=10.1038/nature09792|bibcode = 2011Natur.470..187L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project inspired and paved the way for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=J|last2=Sun|first2=E|last3=Nevo|first3=D|title=Domestication Evolution, Genetics And Genomics In Wheat|journal=Molecular Breeding|date=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=281–301|doi=10.1007/s11032-011-9608-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and how does this play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.

== Ethical, legal and social issues ==
At the onset of the Human Genome Project several ethical, legal, and social concerns were raised in regards to how increased knowledge of the human genome could be used to discriminate against people.  One of the main concerns of most individuals was the fear that both employers and health insurance companies would refuse to hire individuals or refuse to provide insurance to people because of a health concern indicated by someone's genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greely|first=Henry|title=The Code of Codes: Scientific and Social Issues in the Human Genome Project|date=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-13646-5|pages=264–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996 the United States passed the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) which protects against the unauthorized and non-consensual release of individually identifiable health information to any entity not actively engaged in the provision of healthcare services to a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = US Department of Health and Human Services|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html|title=Understanding Health Information Privacy|date=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with identifying all of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes in the human genome, the Human Genome Project also sought to address the ethical, legal, and social issues that were created by the onset of the project. For that the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990. Five percent of the annual budget was allocated to address the ELSI arising from the project.&lt;ref name=human/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Genetics Home Reference|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/hgp/elsi |title= What were some of the ethical, legal, and social implications addressed by the Human Genome Project?| work=ghr.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This budget started at approximately $1.57 million in the year 1990, but increased to approximately $18 million in the year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10002329/elsi-research-program-fact-sheet/|title=ELSI Research Program Fact Sheet - National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the project may offer significant benefits to medicine and scientific research, some authors have emphasized the need to address the potential social consequences of mapping the human genome. "Molecularising disease and their possible cure will have a profound impact on what patients expect from medical help and the new generation of doctors' perception of illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinberger|first=H.J.|title=Living and Working with the New Medical Technologies|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">The '''Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand''' ('''ICANZ''') is an [[industry trade group]] representing commercial, residential and industrial [[building insulation|insulation]] suppliers in Australia and New Zealand.

ICANZ solely represents the commercial interests of the fibreglass and rockwool industries and does not represent the industry as a whole.

Advocated issues are as much about increasing the market share and profitability for [[Fletcher Building|Fletcher Insulation]] and CSR Bradfords

The Council advocates for the increased use of insulation as a means of improving [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], develops technical standards for insulation design and installation and lobbies Australian and state and national governments on industry regulation.

{{Nihongo|'''Islam Mohamed Himu'''|イスラム・モハメッド・ヒム|Isuramu Mohameddo Himu|{{lang-bn|ইসলাম মোহামেদ হিমু}}}} is a Bangladeshi businessman in Japan who was wrongfully accused of [[al-Qaeda]]-related activities.

==Early life==
Himu lived in Canada, where he met and married a Japanese woman; the two came to Japan together in 1995.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/nn20050402f4.html|date=2 April 2005|accessdate=15 January 2008|title=Alleged al-Qaeda link seeks vindication; Bangladeshi wants apology, claims he was falsely accused by police, press|periodical=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Japan, he lived in [[Toda, Saitama|Toda]], [[Saitama Prefecture]], and had two children with his wife.&lt;ref name="Wrecked"&gt;{{citation|title=Antiterrorism drive wrecks Muslim's life|periodical=The Daily Yomiuri; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire|date=18 December 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-18263340_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a telecommunications business, Ryo International, in 1995, which sold prepaid telephone cards and mobile phones; it had been growing rapidly, from [[Japanese yen|¥]]40&amp;nbsp;million of sales in 2000 to ¥350&amp;nbsp;million in 2001 and ¥800&amp;nbsp;million in 2003. He gained permanent residency in Japan in 2000.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times20040526"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article432943.ece|date=26 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008|title=Japan makes first al-Qaeda arrests in dawn raids|periodical=The Times|last=Parry|first=Richard Lloyd | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiji"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Jiji Press; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire |title=Massive Fund Transfers from Japan to al-Qaeda Suspected |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21481932_ITM |date=27 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an office in Tokyo's [[Akihabara]] district as well a branch in [[Yokosuka]], where he employed three [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipina immigrants]], but rarely visited the Yokosuka office, according to the building's owner.&lt;ref name="Times20040526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Stars and Stripes|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=21606&amp;archive=true|title=Reports place al-Qaida suspect on Yokosuka Naval Base|date=29 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008|last=Montgomery|first=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and release==
Himu was arrested in a dawn raid on 26 May 2004 in Tokyo on charges of falsifying business-related documents; police targeted him because of his alleged connection to French fugitive [[Lionel Dumont]], who had stayed in Japan between 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="Times20040526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiji"/&gt; He had met Dumont at a mosque in [[Isesaki]], [[Gunma Prefecture]] in 1999; eager to do business, Himu gave Dupont his namecard, and sold him several phone cards.&lt;ref name="Wrecked"/&gt; Police also raided the branch office in Yokosuka, where they arrested a Bangladeshi employee of Himu's.&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt; The media referred to him as "Japan's first suspected Islamic terrorist", while [[United States Forces Japan]] spokesmen claimed he had been seen at the [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]] directly across from his office "gathering intelligence".&lt;ref name="Times20040526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt; He had been under surveillance for nearly a year before the arrest, according to Japanese media reports.&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt;

Himu was indicted on 7 July 2004 by the [[Tokyo Summary Court]], which ordered him to pay a fine of [[Japanese yen|¥]]300,000 for his violation of the [[Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law]], consisting of having employed his younger brother and another illegal foreign resident between August 2001 and May 2004. Following his payment of the fine, he was released.&lt;ref name="Yomiuri"&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Daily Yomiuri; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire|title=Man held in terror probe freed after paying fine|date=9 July 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21928848_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors declined to indict him on any charges relating to alleged al-Qaeda connections.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
After Himu's release, he found his business and his life disrupted; his employees had all departed, and bills he had been unable to collect while in custody while his suppliers waited for payment left him with ¥120 million in debt. Many of his former associates declined to do business with him any more; transportation companies even refused to ship his products. Eventually, with his business bankrupt, he closed down his existing offices and opened up a new business under a different name.&lt;ref name="Wrecked"/&gt; Several countries also barred him from obtaining a visa due to the unproven allegations.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt;

In April 2005, Himu filed a human rights complaint with the [[Japan Federation of Bar Associations]], hoping to gain a public apology from senior police officials and the [[Media of Japan|Japanese media]], whom he accused of having "ruined [his] life".&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt; In October of that year, he also filed libel suits in the [[Tokyo District Court]] in his own name and that of his company against various media organisations, including [[Kyodo News]] and the [[Nippon Television Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Japan Times|date=6 October 2005|accessdate=15 January 2008|title=Bangladeshi sues Kyodo for libel|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=31028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the Tokyo District Court ordered the ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' to pay Himu in compensation for their having published a front-page report giving his true name and falsely claiming he was a "top terrorist"; the court stated that the publication of his name was inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071211p2a00m0na027000c.html|periodical=Mainichi Shimbun|title=Sankei newspaper ordered to compensate foreigner over Al Qaeda slur|date=11 December 2007|accessdate=15 January 2008|archivedate=11 January 2008|archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:FMjWyXBFe78J:mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071211p2a00m0na027000c.htm&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3975">'''Joseph "Joe" Bertman''' (1902–1988) born in Lublin, Poland, founded Joseph Bertman, Inc. as a wholesale grocery business in the 1920s in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=BJ7 BERTMAN, JOSEPH - The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History]&lt;/ref&gt;  He created the formulation for a mustard that became iconic in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] which spawned two brands, [[Bertman Original Ballpark Mustard|Bertman Original Ball Park Mustard]] and [[Stadium Mustard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2009/08/mustard_gas_can_you_tell_the_d.html Cleveland.com] -  Battle of the mustards: Stadium vs. Bertman's - October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=JBI Encyclopedia of Cleveland History] - JOSEPH BERTMAN, INC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertman began the business in his twenties with a partner  in a garage at the Bertman home at E. 147th near Kinsman, where spices and pickles were processed and packaged.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; The partner was bought out during the first few years of the business.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://bertmanballparkmustard.com/about-us/ Bertman Ballpark Mustard - Official Site] - About Us&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertman expanded his sales territory from Cleveland to [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. After [[World War II|WWII]] he had negotiated exclusive distribution rights to many food products with a fleet of trucks and a large sales force.

The company moved to 653 E. 103rd by the mid-1930s, and changed its name to '''Bertman Pickle Co.'''. Not too shortly after that, the company moved again, this time to 2180 E. 76th.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; The company changed its name to [[Bertman Foods Company]], which is now located at 7777 Grand Avenue in Cleveland.

The company sold pickles, salad dressings, spices, coffees, teas, and canned and dried foods products to schools, hospitals, and other large-scale food operations.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bertmanballparkmustard.com/history.htm |title=www.bertmanballparkmustard.com |publisher=www.bertmanballparkmustard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624030952/http://www.bertmanballparkmustard.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His company supplied mustard to [[League Park]] (then the home of the [[Cleveland Indians]]) and the [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]. Known for coming up with products to meet the needs of his clients, Bertman invented his spicy brown mustard in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/271#.V44_JpMrKAz&lt;/ref&gt;

His mustard, under the family label, is served at major sports venues in Cleveland to this day. The mustard branded by one of his former employees, Stadium Authentic Mustard, is sold in retail stores, supermarkets, and online, and served in over 150 stadiums and arenas throughout the United States, but not in most [[Cleveland]] sports stadiums, where the competing Bertman's Original brand continues to be sold.

Bertman befriended and mentored many well-known names in the food business. It is said that he introduced Chef Boy-ar-dee creator [[Hector Boyardee]] to [[Vernon Stouffer]].  [[Lewis J. Minor]] started his food company, [[L.J. Minor Corporation]] with a sublet of a back room at a Bertman warehouse on E. 76th street between Cedar and Central.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;

==History==

Bertman, born in Lublin, Poland, came to Cleveland as a child with his parents.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; He was the oldest of several children, his company biography notes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bertmanballparkmustard.com/about-us/ BertmanBallParkMustard.com] - Official Website - About&lt;/ref&gt;

He also has an honorary doctorate from the [[Aalto University School of Economics|Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration]].

==Academics==
Krishna Palepu's research has been in the areas of strategy in emerging markets, [[corporate governance]] and corporate disclosure.&lt;ref name="slide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indou"/&gt; His work focuses on making corporate boards more effective, and improving corporate disclosure. In the area of strategy, his focus has been on the globalization of emerging markets, particularly India and China, and the resulting opportunities and challenges for western multinationals as well as local companies with global aspirations in these countries.

In his prior work, he has done research and published papers on mergers and acquisitions and corporate disclosure. He has been on the Editorial Boards of leading academic journals &lt;ref name="drfd"/&gt; and is a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;ref name="NBER"/&gt;

===Books===
;''Winning in Emerging Markets''
In ''[[Winning in Emerging Markets (book by Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu)|Winning in Emerging Markets]]'', released in 2010, [[Tarun Khanna]] and Krishna Palepu outline a practical framework for developing emerging market strategies based not on broad categorical definitions like geography, but on a structural understanding of these markets. Their framework describes how “institutional voids” – the absence of intermediaries like market research firms and credit card systems to efficiently connect buyers and sellers – create daunting obstacles for companies trying to operate in emerging markets. Understanding these voids – and learning how to work with them in specific markets – is the key to success.&lt;ref name="winninin"/&gt;

;''Business Analysis and Valuation Using Financial Statements''
The fourth edition of ''[[Business Analysis And Valuation Using Financial Statements: Text and Cases]]'', co-authored with Paul Healy, was published by Thomson Southwestern in 2007.&lt;ref name="cenpage"/&gt; Based on Krishna Palepu's research on mergers and acquisitions, finance and corporate disclosure, this textbook is widely used in college and MBA courses on business analysis and valuation. It has been translated into Chinese, Japanese and Spanish.&lt;ref name="drfd"/&gt;

The book won the [[American Accounting Association]]'s Wildman Award for its impact on management practice, as well as the Notable Contribution to the Accounting Literature Award for its impact on academic research.&lt;ref name="aaah"/&gt;

It is accompanied by a business analysis and valuation software model published by the [[Harvard Business School|Harvard Business School Publishing Company]].&lt;ref name="hbr"/&gt; A fifth edition was published in 2013.&lt;ref name="fifth"/&gt;

===Publications===
Krishna Palepu has published numerous articles in academic journals and practitioner-oriented publications including ''[[Journal of Accounting and Economics]]'', ''[[The Accounting Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[MIT Sloan Management Review]]'', ''[[Brown Journal of World Affairs]]'', ''[[Strategic Finance]]'', ''[[Contemporary Accounting Research]]'', the ''[[Journal of Finance]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Journal of Accounting Research]]'', ''[[Journal of International Business Studies]]'', and ''[[The Review of Economics and Statistics]]''.

He has also published dozens of [[Harvard Business School]] cases and course materials.

===Teaching===
He teaches courses in the Accounting and Control unit and courses on strategy in emerging markets at Harvard Business School (HBS). He also teaches in several executive programs at HBS.&lt;ref name="drfd"/&gt;

==Non-Academic Activities==
Palepu has been a director of a number of companies around the world including Brooks Automation,&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; BTM Corporation, [[Partners Harvard Medical International]], Polymedica,
and [[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] &lt;ref name="dred"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dreddtwo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian court fine"/&gt;
Professor Palepu has a Professional Director Certification from the American College of Corporate Directors.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2016}} On December 8th, 2014, a local Indian court required the return of Rs 2.6 crore for providing professional services to Satyam Computers and remaining on the board as an non-executive director without the company first gaining the government's approval for providing such services. The ruling is under appeal.

'''Kyle Findlay''' is a Canadian [[entrepreneur]], creative and co-founder of the [[Toronto]]-based fashion label, retailer and manufacturer [[Kanati Clothing Company]]. He is also a [[restaurant]] owner and has worked with [[Cash Money Records]] closely as a talent scount and songwriter.  He is also the co-creator of a [[cut and sew]] manufacturing and logistics program which manufactures for upwards of 100 private retail labels globally.

==About Kanati Co.==
[[Kanati Clothing Company]] was formed in July 2009 in [[Toronto]]. ''Kanati Co.'' quickly gained market traction by becoming a celebrity favorite which led to the company entering a multi-year international distribution arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanaticlothingco.com/site/home |title=Home - Site |publisher=Kanaticlothingco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company gained notoriety as a pioneer in the [[fashion]] industry by creating an [[First Nations|Aboriginal]] influenced premium lifestyle band which had not yet been seen before. "Kanati Co." grew to national distribution in the first year in business and it eventually developed into a 14-country distribution network over the next 5 years. The brand was popularized in the U.S by its appearance in numerous music videos from artists like [[Drag-On]] of [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment]], [[Joey Stylez]], [[Meek Mill]]/[[Rick Ross]], [[Ja Rule]] and other popular musicians such as Sean P from the group [[YoungBloodZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scmlmag.com/2013/08/16/sean-paul-announces-working-with-kanati-co-on-twitter/ |title=SCML Magazine |publisher=Scmlmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823082335/http://scmlmag.com/2013/08/16/sean-paul-announces-working-with-kanati-co-on-twitter/ |archivedate=2013-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The label was seen on music group [[Winnipeg's Most]] in the Maclean's Magazine "Straight Outta Winnipeg" feature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/straight-outta-winnipeg/ |title=Straight Outta Winnipeg |publisher=Maclean's Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on [[CBC Television]]'s Aboriginal series "8th Fire" hosted by Wab kinew.

The company launched its flagship store in Waterloo, Ontario in August, 2014.&lt;ref name="Waterloo Record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4761208-mcmullan-s-is-back-with-hot-pizza-and-cold-beer/|title=Waterloo Record |publisher=Waterloo Record |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-Demand Program==
In 2014, along with [[Liam Massaubi]], he designed a program for retail fashion designers. The program runs on a pre-qualified membership basis and enables retail labels to meet compliance and expand product lines without the capital investment  and need for inventory and minimum orders. The system handles warehousing and distribution for retail labels.&lt;ref name="Ill Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illsocietymag.com/?p=21135|title=Kanati Co. - The Made-on-Demand Program |publisher=Ill Society Magazine |date=2015-02-02|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program launch was extremely successful seeing as many as 100 retai-ready labels joining. But unforeseen disruptions arose a couple of months into production in [[Pakistan]] relating to flooding, power shortages&lt;ref name="Customs Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customstoday.com.pk/about-6700-mw-shortfall-canada-based-kanati-clothing-leaves-pakistan-after-6-years-due-to-energy-crisis/|title=About 6700 MW Shortfall Causes Canada Based Kanati Clothing to Leave Pakistan After 6 Years |publisher=Customs Today |date=2015-02-02|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political unrest the company to pull all production from the country.&lt;ref name="Yarns &amp; Fibers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yarnsandfibers.com/news/textile-news/textile-manufacturer-kanati-plans-close-doors-pakistan-and-focus-domestically#.VgHq5GRVhHw |title=Textile Manufacturer Kanati plans to close doors in Pakistan and focus domestically |publisher=Yarns &amp; Fibers |date=2015-01-27|accessdate=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to exit the country was called a ''"wake up call, both for those representing multi-nationals' interests in Pakistan and those Pakistani firms in the multi-nationals' value chains."'' by the Contracting &amp; Procurement Manager at Shell Pakistan.'&lt;ref name="Compliance &amp; Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complianceandethics.org/businesses-exit-pakistan-over-corruption-risk/|title=Western companies moving out of Pakistan due to unfriendly business environment|publisher=Compliance &amp; Ethics|date=2015-03-24|accessdate=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an article published by The International New York Times, Liam Massaubi was quoted saying ''"Energy issues, transportation issues and continuous [[supply chain]] disruptions were creating problems for us."'&lt;ref name="International New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/831179/trading-difficulties-hostile-conditions-sink-another-foreign-entity/|title=Trading difficulties: Hostile conditions sink another foreign entity |publisher=International New York Times |date=2015-02-01|accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events, in part, prompted the [[Government of Pakistan]] to respond with a new plan to implement a new textile policy aimed at doubling exports.&lt;ref name=Just-Style&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-style.com/analysis/pakistans-new-textile-policy-aims-to-double-exports_id124385.aspx |title=Pakistan's New Textile Policy Aims to Double Exports |publisher=Just-Style |date=2015-02-16|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanati Co. was not the only company that experienced problems at that time. [[Walt Disney Company]] pulled approximately $200 million worth of production from the country due to an unfriendly business environment.

Kanati Company negotiated a $5 million deal over 5 years with GSG Apparel, Inc.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read/29896039/Kanati_Co._Announces_Partnership_with_GSG_Apparel|title=Kanati Co. Announces Partnership with GSG |publisher=The Pakistan Herald |date=2015-05-17|accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; establish a first of its kind Canadian facility. This was accomplished in only 3.5 months time.&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.financialcontent.com/ibtimes/news/read?GUID=29131580|title=Textile Manufacturer Kanati Co. Embraces Domestic Approach |publisher=International Business Times |date=2015-05-24|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to production in [[Canada]] was mentioned in Just-Style.com's "Outdoor Brands in Innovation Buzz."&lt;ref name="Just-Style.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-style.com/the-just-style-blog/outdoor-brands-in-innovation-buzz_id2330.aspxl|title=Outdoor brands in Innovation Buzz |publisher=Just-Style.com |date=2015-05-17|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GSG Apparel, Inc. would eventually adopt the entire On-Demand program in a negotiated deal with Kanati Co in 2015.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Business Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.financialcontent.com/salemcomm.kdow/news/read?GUID=30582542 |title=GSG to Takeover Manufacturing |publisher=Wall Street Business Network |date=2015-08-18|accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four archived ''[[New York Times]]'' stories from the 1920s preserve the LIA’s rhapsodic early efforts to promote business relocation from New York City. The LIA website’s history section states: Incorporated on July 26, 1926 as the Long Island Chamber of Commerce, the LIA still today takes its mission very seriously: "To support growth, economic development and infrastructure investments on Long Island and to advocate for tax reforms and regulatory relief to improve the local economy and strengthen our business community." The LIA’s own headquarters remained in Manhattan until 1949. It is now based in Melville.

The LIA is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that seeks to make Long Island a better place and business-friendly region. It is the organization looked to both on and off the Island to articulate the region's needs and its future direction. It works closely with organizations throughout the state and the country to positively influence public policy and ensure a prosperous future for the region.

Former presidents included [[William J. Casey]], later [[CIA]] Director under President Ronald Reagan and James Lacrocca, former New York State Commissioner of Energy and Transportation. It is now led by Kevin S. Law who has held several top positions in the public and private sectors.

LIA members enjoy a wide array of benefits-from participation on active committees addressing the major issues facing the region and networking events large and small-to major events that attract former U.S. Presidents and other nationally known respected speakers, as well as a variety of unique publications that provide special insight into Long Island's economy.

{{one source|date=November 2017}}

'''Macromanagement''' is a management theory with two different approaches to the definition that both share a common idea; management from afar. 

Contrary to [[micromanagement]] where managers closely observe and control the works of their employees, macromanagement is a more independent style of organizational management. Managers step back and give employees the freedom to do their job how they think it is best done, so long as the desired result is reached. This is the most commonly applied understanding of macromanagement. 

Both styles of management are viewed as a negative when taken to an extreme, so it is important for organizations to develop a balance of micro- and macromanagement practices and understand when to apply which. 

The second interpretation of macromanagement is when an organization views itself as a social [[institution,]] orienting its goals and purpose toward serving society. To do this, they align the organization’s values, norms, ethics with those of the society they are immersed in. In 1971, Alan Wells defined a social institution as “patterns of rules, customs, norms, beliefs and roles that are instrumentally related to the needs and purposes of society.” Other examples of social institutions in this respect include government and religious organizations, some more in-line with serving society that others.  

This interpretation of macromanagement is less about managing employees, but rather managing the organization from a broader perspective that is oriented toward the future. An organization that practices macromanagement greatly considers the future of the organization, the future of society, and their impact on one another.

'''Martin Zaimov''' (born 16 April 1962) is a [[Bulgaria]]n [[financier]] and politician, former deputy governor of the [[Bulgarian National Bank]] (97-03) and candidate for [[list of mayors of Sofia|mayor of Sofia]] in 2007.

Zaimov was born in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], where his mother Klavdia Zaimova was working at the World Health Organisation. His father was the [[United Kingdom|British]] long-time [[Associated Press]] foreign correspondent Michael Goldsmith.&lt;ref name=mediapool&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=131654&amp;p=45|title=Мартин Заимов е десният кандидат за кмет на София|trans-title=Martin Zaimov is the right candidate for mayor of Sofia|last=Николов|first=Красен|date=2007-09-03|publisher=Mediapool|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaimova and Goldsmith later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/25/obituaries/michael-goldsmith-68-foreign-correspondent.html|title=Michael Goldsmith, 68, Foreign Correspondent|date=1990-10-25|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Zaimov belongs to the noted Zaimov family: he is the grandson of General [[Vladimir Zaimov]] and the great grandson of revolutionary [[Stoyan Zaimov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=131671&amp;p=2|title=Кой е Мартин Заимов?|trans-title=Who is Martin Zaimov?|date=2007-09-03|publisher=Mediapool|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaimov graduated in electronic technology at the [[Technical University of Sofia]], economics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] and European Studies at the [[London School of Economics]]. Zaimov has three children, Sara (born 93), Thomas (98) and Zacharie (09).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blitz.bg/news/article/53961|title=Мартин Заимов стана татко за трети път|trans-title=Martin Zaimov became a dad for a third time|date=2009-06-19|publisher=БЛИЦ|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Zaimov emigrated from Bulgaria in 1986 but came back after the collapse of the communist regime. He then worked for the French branch of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and later for the international trader [[Louis Dreyfus Group|Louis Dreyfus]].

In 1997, he became vice minister of Commerce in the interim government and introduced sweeping liberalisation to trade by scrapping price controls and customs tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/archive/2003/02/22/society/s3643_10.htm|title=Мартин Заимов&amp;nbsp;— банкер с емоции|trans-title=Martin Zaimov - Banker with emotions|date=2003-02-22|publisher=Стандарт|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 July 1997, Zaimov was elected Deputy Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank by Parliament and effectively became the person in charge of the Bulgarian [[currency board]].

In 2007, Martin Zaimov ran for Mayor of Sofia, supported by the [[right-wing]] [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of the Democratic Forces]] and [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria]]. Zaimov came second with 17.77% of votes, behind [[Boyko Borisov]], the founder of [[GERB]] who gathered 53.43%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.actualno.com/news_131380.html|title=Бойко Борисов печели изборите с 53.43%|trans-title=Boyko Borisov won the election with 53.43%|date=2007-10-29|publisher=Actualno.com|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-07-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030052904/http://politics.actualno.com/news_131380.html|archivedate=2007-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaimov then spent 4 years as Deputy Chair of Sofia's Municipal Council. He was instrumental in the city administration's shift in mobility, urban planning and nature preservation policies.

Since 2007, he has been board member of [[Société Générale]]-owned [http://www.sgeb.bg/ Expressbank.] Since 2011 he has managed an urban regeneration [http://jessicafund.bg/en/ fund], subsidiary of the bank, financed by the EU FESSICA Initiative.

He has been a member of the boards of trustees of the Institute for Market Economics (1993-15), the [[American University in Bulgaria]] (2000-10) and the Centre for Advanced Study in Sofia (2008–16).

Martin Zaimov is a founding member of the [http://baeps.org/en/ Bulgarian Electric Vehicles Association] and since then has been an active promoter of electric mobility.

'''Sir Naim Eliahou Dangoor''', [[CBE]] (April 1914 – 19 November 2015) was a British-naturalised Iraqi-born Jewish entrepreneur and philanthropist.

==Early life ==
He was born in [[Baghdad]] in April 1914, the second of six siblings.  His father Eliahou Dangoor (1883–1976) was the world's largest printer of Arabic books,&lt;ref name=Millman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Millman|first1=Joel|title=Iraq's forgotten exiles seek redress|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/05/iraq.theeditorpressreview|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=5 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his grandfather [[Ezra Dangoor|Hakham Ezra Reuben Dangoor]] was the [[Chief Rabbi]] of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Iraq's forgotten exiles seek redress|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/05/iraq.theeditorpressreview|work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate = 24 September 2015|first = Joel|last = Millman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Dangoor made the five-day journey from Baghdad to London, at the age of 17, in order to enroll in an engineering degree at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name= IPD&gt;{{Cite web|title = Two Centenarians: Iraq’s First Coke Bottler Shares a Birth Year With the Coca-Cola Bottle|url = https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/260467001/two-centenarians-iraq-s-first-coke-bottler-shares-a-birth-year-with-the-coca-cola-bottle|accessdate = 20 November 2015|author = Jamal Booker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating he returned to Iraq where he was conscripted into the army and became an officer. It was during his army training that he met his future business partner Ahmed Safwat.&lt;ref name= IPD/&gt;

==Career ==
Initially on leaving the army he had hoped to become an engineer on the railways, but due to restrictions imposed upon Jews this was not possible, so he and Ahmed, a Muslim, decided to go into business together, setting up Eastern Industries in 1949.

Their first contract was to supply new windows to all Iraqi government buildings, and soon their portfolio grew to include property development and letting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Funding education runs in their family |url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/131565/funding-education-runs-their-family|work= [[The Jewish Chronicle]]|date = 12 March 2015|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1950, Eastern industries secured the first contract to bottle [[Coca-Cola]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Two Centenarians: Iraq’s First Coke Bottler Shares a Birth Year With the Coca-Cola Bottle|url = https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/260467001/two-centenarians-iraq-s-first-coke-bottler-shares-a-birth-year-with-the-coca-cola-bottle|accessdate = 24 September 2015|first = IPD|last = Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside Eastern Industries, Dangoor also ran factories producing matches and furniture.

With the founding of the State of Israel and the resulting conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the situation for Jews in the country worsened and in 1959 Dangoor took the difficult decision to take his family out. He continued travelling back and forth for business until 1963, when he decided that the worsening political situation made it too risky for him to return.  As a result of laws specific to Jews, he lost his Iraqi citizenship, and his property and business interests were taken by the government.&lt;ref name="promises"&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Curtis|first1 = Polly|title = Keeping promises|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/nov/26/accesstouniversity.highereducation|work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate = 11 June 2014|date = 26 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was eventually permitted to settle in the UK where he set about rebuilding his life, setting up a property business that his four sons went on to join.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite web|title = Dr Naim Dangoor|url = http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2009/12/portal_factory/NPArticle/nparticle.2009-12-08.0519426930/index.html|publisher = [[University of Leicester]]|accessdate = 11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

In November 1947, Dangoor married his cousin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12031574/Sir-Naim-Dangoor-businessman-obituary.html|title=Sir Naim Dangoor, businessman - obituary|date=2015-12-03|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renée Dangoor (who had been crowned [[Miss Iraq]] earlier that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dangoor family donates £1.1m to Cancer Research UK|url = http://www.fundraising.co.uk/2010/08/02/dangoor-family-donates-11m-cancer-research-uk/|website = UK Fundraising|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have four sons.

==Philanthropy  ==
In order to preserve the heritage of the community he had left behind, soon after settling in the UK, he founded a community centre in West [[Kensington]] for new Iraqi Jewish immigrants, and in 1971 began editing and publishing ''The Scribe – Journal of Babylonian Jewry'', with 4000 subscribers in 25 countries which continued to be published for 35 years.&lt;ref name="University" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Scribe – Journal of Babylonian Jewry|url = http://www.dangoor.com/scribe.html|website = www.dangoor.com|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 he revived the title of [[Exilarch]] – an ancient title held by the supreme leader of all the Jewish communities in Babylonia, up until the 13th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EXILARCH – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/exilarch|website = www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate = 24 September 2015|last = electricpulp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he demanded £12 billion ($20 billion) from Iraq's leaders as compensation for what the Iraqi-Jewish community had lost in Iraq after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millman|first1=Joel|title=Iraq's forgotten exiles seek redress|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/05/iraq.theeditorpressreview|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=5 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his business in the UK grew, he wanted to give back to the country that had taken him in.  In 1980 he set up the Exilarch's Foundation, a charity that has made numerous donations to causes relating to education and health.&lt;ref name = "Funding"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Funding education runs in their family |url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/131565/funding-education-runs-their-family|author= Charlotte Oliver|work = [[The Jewish Chronicle]]|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 he created the Dangoor Scholarships to help one thousand undergraduate students who had no family history of further education, at the 1994 Group of universities.&lt;ref name = "Funding"/&gt;

A few years later in 2009 he created the Eliahou Dangoor Scholarships, in honour of his father.  These were awarded to four thousand undergraduate students, with limited means, studying STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects.&lt;ref name = "Funding"/&gt;

In the same year Dangoor was made honorary President for the Association of Jewish Academics from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://iraqijews.awardspace.com/books.html?|title = Association for Jewish Academics from Iraq|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exilarch's Foundation also sponsors the Westminster Academy in West London, whose pupils hail from over 60 countries, many in the Middle East. Dangoor's family have been closely involved with the running of the school and have seen it go from being issued with an Ofsted 'Notice to Improve' in 2009, to being rated as 'Outstanding' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ofsted {{!}} Westminster Academy|url = http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/131262|website = reports.ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Academy opened the number of students achieving five A*-C GCSE grades including both English and Maths has increased from 17% to 70% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://westminsteracademy.net/documents/September2010.pdf|title = Westminster Academy Documents|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ofsted School Data Dashboard for Westminster Academy|url = http://dashboard.ofsted.gov.uk/dash.php?urn=131262|website = dashboard.ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangoor also donated a significant amount to [[Cancer Research UK]] to support their website, in memory of his late wife Renée, who died from breast cancer in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding and Partners|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/utilities/about-cancerhelp-uk/funding-and-partners|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Bar-Ilan University]] in Israel, Dangoor set up the Dangoor Centre for Personalised Medicine in the [[Galilee]], which partners with hospitals to analyse the genetic makeup of individual patients, enabling doctors to implement the most effective treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bar-Ilan University and the British Friends of Bar-Ilan proudly announce the establishment of the Dangoor Center for Personalised Medicine at the University's School of Medicine in the Galilee – British Friends of Bar-Ilan|url = http://www.bfbiu.org/healthcare/bar-ilan-university-british-friends-bar-ilan-proudly-announce-establishment-dangoor-center-personalised-medicine-universitys-school-medicine-galilee/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 he made the largest gift to the Royal Society of Medicine in its history.  The donation is being used to help support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who would like to pursue a career in medicine, as well as supporting the society's post-graduate education provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Royal Society of Medicine celebrates £2m donation from Naim Dangoor – RSM press release|url = https://www.rsm.ac.uk/about-us/media-information/2014-media-releases/royal-society-of-medicine-celebrates-2m-donation-from-naim-dangoor.aspx|website = www.rsm.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangoor was also the largest private individual donor to the [[Francis Crick Institute]] in London, Europe's largest biomedical research centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Europe's superlab: Sir Paul's cathedral|url = http://www.nature.com/news/europe-s-superlab-sir-paul-s-cathedral-1.17827|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangoor Walk, a pathway that runs beside the Francis Crick Institute and links Midland Road with Ossulton Street, is named after him.

Through his foundation Dangoor promoted the idea of 'Universal Monotheism' a concept that he believes can bring about unity and create a framework for a global religious ethic.  He has sponsored the setting up of a [http://www.monotheism-biu.org/ centre for Universal Monotheism at Bar-Ilan University] from which he received an honorary doctorate in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bar Ilan University {{!}} Honorary Doctorate Recipients|url = http://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php?id=982&amp;pt=1&amp;pid=35&amp;level=3&amp;cPath=35|website = www1.biu.ac.il|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made contributions to the [[University of Nanjing]] in China, and had a particular interest in China because his late wife Renée was born and grew up in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which country has 10 Jewish study centres? (And it's not obvious) {{!}} The Jewish Chronicle|url = http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/52356/which-country-has-10-jewish-study-centres-and-its-not-obvious|website = www.thejc.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Nanjing he funded scholarships for the university's Jewish Studies Institute and sponsored an international symposium on monotheism, attended by delegates from all over China, the US, Australia and Israel.  In 2011 he was made a consultant professor of the University of Nanjing in recognition of his contributions.

==Honours ==

{{Japanese name|Ōkura}}
''Incorporates translations from the corresponding Japanese Wikipedia article''

{{nihongo|'''Baron Ōkura Kihachirō'''|大倉 喜八郎||October 23, 1837 &amp;ndash; April 5, 1928}} was an [[entrepreneur]] who built up the Ōkura-gumi and founded the giant ''Ōkura [[zaibatsu]]'' (literally financial cliques) and the ''Ōkura Shōgyō Gakkō'' which later became [[Tokyo Keizai University]] in 1949.

== Biography ==
In contrast to most of the zaibatsu, the Ōkura zaibatsu was founded by someone from the peasant class. Ōkura Kihachirō moved from what is now [[Niigata Prefecture]] on the north shore of [[Honshū]] to [[Edo]] and worked for three years before starting his own grocery store in 1857. After selling groceries for eight years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/zaibatsu.htm#OKURA Okura zaibatsu]&lt;/ref&gt; he became a [[weapons]] dealer during the turbulent years between the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] and the eventual overthrow in 1867 of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] and despite being born a peasant, he became an expert in [[Shindō Munen-ryū]]. He became one of the principal business investors of the original [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] completed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtokyo.com/okura.html Okura]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kihachiro's son, [[Kishichiro Okura|Kishichirō]], is credited with introducing the [[automobile]] into [[Japan]].

Kihachiro, who made a fortune in his lifetime and lived in [[Toranomon]], was a collector of [[Oriental]] [[antiques]]. In fear of valuable [[Visual arts|artworks]] flowing out to other countries, he built Japan’s first private [[museum]], the [[Ōkura Shukokan]], in 1917 by donating many cultural assets he had collected, the land, and the funds. The 5-story building stood on a property of about 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres), but it was damaged in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. The Ōkura Shukokan that now stands adjacent to the Hotel Ōkura was rebuilt in 1928; it was based on a design by [[Itō Chūta]], who is known for his design for [[Tsukiji Honganji]] Temple, and is designated as a cultural asset of Japan. The museum houses 2,000 pieces of Oriental paintings and sculptures, including such national treasures as the wooden statue of [[Samantabhadra]] and 35,000 volumes of [[Chinese literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.city.minato.tokyo.jp/yukari/e/man-detail.cgi?id=16&amp;CGISESSID=dcd5fd43789c08a3a564dcfaa4f6ce9b Prominent People of Minato City]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''partially disclosed principal''' is one whose agent reveals that he has a principal, but does not reveal the principal's identity. This concept has important implications in liability law. It is in contrast to a [[disclosed principal]] and [[undisclosed principal]].&lt;ref&gt;Bohlman, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-324-06183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(An English translation by the Supreme Court of Japan of this case information has not yet been published; however, one will be published in the Journal of Japanese Law, No. 26, 2008.

The Bull-dog Sauce Case ([http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=02&amp;hanreiNo=35027&amp;hanreiKbn=01 株主総会決議禁止等仮処分命令申立て却下決定に対する抗告棄却決定に対する許可抗告事件]) is a Supreme Court of Japan case that resulted in a landmark decision regarding hostile takeover defense plans (such as the "[[poison pill]]").  The Court held that such plans do not necessarily violate the principle of shareholder equality under Japanese statutes, even if they result in discriminatory treatment some shareholders; however, such decisions must be made by shareholders themselves, acting in the company's best interest; they cannot be made by management to protect itself.  The Bull-dog Sauce case arose from the first use of a poison pill by a Japanese company,&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 2. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the Supreme Court's first ruling on the subject of takeover defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 13. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual Background==

The  Bull-Dog Sauce Co., Ltd. is a Japanese company engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of food seasonings and sauces; it also owns and leases apartments and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.google.com/finance?q=TYO:2804 BULL-DOG SAUCE CO., LTD.] on Google Finance&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel Partners LLC is an American hedge fund with offices in New York and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=23113 Steel Partners LLC] at BusinessWeek.com.  The main [http://www.steelpartners.com/  Steel Partners site] provides no information about the company, however the [http://www.spjsf.jp/english.html  Steel Partners Japan site] contains ample information about the company's activities in Japanese and English&lt;/ref&gt;  It has invested in several Japanese companies that manufacture food and beverage products, including Bull-Dog Sauce, [[House Foods]], [[Sapporo Brewery|Sapporo]], and [[Nissin Foods]]; the fund frequently becomes the largest shareholder of a target company and then attempts a takeover or is vocally critical of the company's management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS47905+07-Apr-2008+BW20080407 "Steel Partners Submits to House Foods Corp.

On March 30, 2007, Sapporo Holdings Ltd. shareholders voted two-thirds in favor of [[poison pill]] takeover defense measures in response to a takeover threat from Steel Partners.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20070330a1.html "Sapporo investors approve poison pill"], Japan Times, 2007-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Background==

===Nippon Broadcasting Case===

The Tokyo District Court and Tokyo High Court rulings both cited the Tokyo High Court's 2005 Nippon Broadcasting Case ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=03&amp;hanreiNo=11&amp;hanreiKbn=02   Full text of the case](in Japanese).  For a general overview of the case, see  Osaki, Sadakazu, "Regulation of Japan's Capital Markets and the Battle of Control of Nippon Broadcasting System" . Nomura Capital Market Review, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 17-24, Summer 2005 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=872248; or Milhaupt, Curtis J., [http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Milhaupt-Web.pdf "In the Shadow of Delaware? The Rise of Hostile Takeovers in Japan"], 105 Colum. L. Rev. 2171 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the High Court ruled that a board of directors was generally ''not'' allowed to issue discriminatory stock warrants to prevent a shareholder from effecting a hostile takeover.  However, The High Court noted an important exception: a board of directors ''was'' allowed to discriminate against a shareholder if that shareholder possessed a "abusive motive" (濫用目的).  (This language was echoed in the High Court's ruling in the Bull-Dog Sauce Case, in which the High Court found Steel Partners to be an "abusive acquirer" (濫用的買収者);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=01&amp;hanreiNo=34950&amp;hanreiKbn=03 Full text of the Tokyo High Court decision], in Japanese&lt;/ref&gt; see below.)  The High Court laid out four examples of clearly abusive motives: (1) [[greenmail]]; (2) "scorched earth" tactics (e.g. pillaging intellectual property); (3) aiming to use the target company's assets to pay off the bidding company's debts; (4) aiming to sell off assets to produce a large one-time dividend.&lt;ref&gt;Milhaupt, Curtis J., [http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Milhaupt-Web.pdf "In the Shadow of Delaware? The Rise of Hostile Takeovers in Japan"], 105 Colum. L. Rev. 2171, 2193-4 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unocal===

''[[Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co.|Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum]]'', 493 A.2d 946 (Del. 1985) was a 1985 Delaware Supreme Court case that established standards for determining the acceptability of takeover defense tactics such as the poison pill.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Gilson, Ronald J., "Unocal Fifteen Year Later (and What We Can Do About It)" . Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 491-513, Nov. 2001 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=333041&lt;/ref&gt;  At the core of the ''Unocal'' decision is the so-called proportionality test: a takeover defense is legitimate if the takeover bid presents a threat to the company, and the defense is proportionate to the threat.&lt;ref&gt;Gilson, Ronald J., "Unocal Fifteen Year Later (and What We Can Do About It)" at page 496. Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 491-513, Nov. 2001 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=333041&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tokyo High Court's ruling in the Nippon Broadcasting Case (see above) has been called a "Unocal rule with Japanese characteristics."&lt;ref name="columbialawreview.org"&gt;Milhaupt, Curtis J., [http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Milhaupt-Web.pdf "In the Shadow of Delaware? The Rise of Hostile Takeovers in Japan"] at page 2172, 105 Colum. L. Rev. 2171 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, in the Nippon Broadcasting Case, both sides referenced ''Unocal'' in their briefs to the trial court.&lt;ref name="columbialawreview.org"/&gt;  The influence of ''Unocal'' was similarly seen in all three courts' rulings in the Bull-Dog Sauce Case &lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 14"&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 14. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of case==

*May 2007: Steel Partners was the largest shareholder of Bull-Dog Sauce with 10.25% of shares.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;
*May 18: Steel Partners initiated a tender offer at ¥1,584 per share with the intention of acquiring 100% of Bull-Dog Sauce stock.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;  It was widely suggested that Steel Partners would attempt [[greenmail]]&lt;ref&gt;"However, the court also made an exception when [a poison pill] might be allowed: to fend off a would-be greenmailer—which many in Japan believe Steel Partners to be. (Steel Partners insists it doesn't engage in greenmail...."[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2007/gb20070618_584050.htm "Lichtenstein Takes on Japan Inc."], Businessweek, 2007-06-18&lt;/ref&gt; or hope for the appearance of a [[White knight (business)|white knight]],&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt; a strategy that had previously proven profitable.&lt;ref&gt;"When Steel Partner's bid for an instant noodle maker was trounced by a white knight, the fund was still able to sell its shares for a 24 per cent premium to the level it was prepared to pay."

*June 7: Bull-Dog Sauce announced that it opposed the tender offer on the grounds that it could possibly harm the common interests of shareholders. At the same time, Bull-Dog Sauce's management proposed changes in the corporate charter and the issuance of stock warrants (the poison pill) at the general shareholders' meeting on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 2-3. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 13: Steel Partners responded by seeking an injunction from the Tokyo District Court prohibiting the directors of Bull-Dog Sauce from passing a resolution on stock warrants and blocking issuance of the stock warrants.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 4. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 15: Steel Partners changed the terms of its tender offer, raising the price to ¥1,700 and pushing the expiration date back from 28 June to 10 August.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*June 19: Steel Partners withdrew the portion of the injunction requesting prohibition of the stock warrant resolution.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*June 24:  At the general shareholders' meeting, the Bull-Dog Sauce's proposals to change the corporate charter and issue stock warrants were both approved with 83.4% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*June 28: The Tokyo District Court rejected Steel Partners' request for an injunction blocking Bull-Dog Sauce's takeover defense.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 4"/&gt;
*July 9: The Tokyo High Court rejected Steel Partners' appeal, upholding the Tokyo District Court's denial of Steel Partners' injunction request.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 7. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 7: The Supreme Court rejected Steel Partners' appeal, upholding the decisions by the Tokyo District Court and the Tokyo High Court to deny Steel Partners' motions.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 12. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court Decision==

===Findings===

The following were among the Supreme Court's findings:&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at pages 13-14. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;
# The principle of shareholder equality, as codified in Article 109-1 of the Company Law, requires that a company treat shareholders fairly based on the type and number of shares they hold.  However, if there is a risk that the acquisition of management control by a particular shareholder would harm the company's interests or the common interests of shareholders, discriminatory treatment of said shareholder aimed at preventing such acquisition is not a violation of the principle of shareholder equality unless said treatment is unreasonable.
# The question of whether the acquisition of management control by a particular shareholder harms the common interests of shareholders "should be decided by the shareholders themselves, to whom the company's interests ultimately inure, and that decision should be respected unless the general shareholders' meeting was procedurally unfair, the facts upon which the decision was predicated prove to be nonexistent or false, or are there is some other important fault that renders the decision unjustified."
# Steel Partners had the opportunity to express its opinion at the general shareholders' meeting, and it was able to receive compensation that approximated the value of the stock warrants. As such, the stock warrants were not unreasonable or contrary to the principle of shareholder equality.
# A takeover defense plan (such as a poison pill) need not be laid out by management prior to a takeover attempt in order to be fair.
# Stock warrants that discriminate against certain shareholders with the aim of supporting the company's management or retaining control in shareholders who support said management is blatantly unfair. The present case does not meet that description, however.

===Validation of Tokyo District Court Ruling===

The Supreme Court's ruling was viewed as a clear expression of preference for the District Court's ruling that the identity of the decisionmaker determines the legitimacy of a takeover defense: shareholders are generally legitimate, whereas managers are generally not.&lt;ref name="Osaki, Sadakazu page 14"/&gt;  See points (2) and (5) in above section "Findings".  The District Court in turn had relied on the earlier Nippon Broadcasting Case to support these rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 5. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;  See above section "Legal Background."

===Rejection of Tokyo High Court Ruling===

The Supreme Court did not adopt the Tokyo High Court's ruling that a discriminatory stock warrant may be used because a hostile bidder is an "abusive acquirer."&lt;ref&gt;Osaki, Sadakazu, "The Bull-Dog Sauce Takeover Defense" at page 15. Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031 ;  "オしたがって，抗告人関係者が原審のいう濫用的買収者に当たるといえるか否

Nomura Capital Market Review Vol. 10, No. 3 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1031031&lt;/ref&gt;  See above section "Legal Background."

==Impact==

The Supreme Court decision was widely seen as a validation of the legality of the poison pill takeover defense scheme under Japanese law.&lt;ref&gt;See E.G. [https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/08/bulldog-steel-partners-markets-equity-cx_jc_0808markets03.html Japan High Court Keeps Bull-Dog Sauce From Steel Partners' Jaws], Forbes.com, 2007-08-08; [http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto080720072149128123&amp;page=2 "Steel Partners loses final court appeal"], Financial Times, 2007-08-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Supreme Court did not validate the Tokyo High Court's finding that Steel Partners was an "abusive acquirer," the High Court's derogatory label received significant attention in the press and the business community.&lt;ref&gt;"The ruling sent shudders through a foreign investing community fearful that their rights will be compromised if they seek to influence the management of Japanese companies, who have reacted with hostility to efforts by foreigners to bring American-style activism to bear to increase shareholder value."[https://www.forbes.com/2007/07/10/bulldog-steel-ruling-markets-equity-cx_vk_0710markets4.html "Open Wide For Your Poison Pill, Steel Partners"], Forbes.com, 2007-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Bull-Dog Sauce estimated a consolidated net loss of 1.7 billion yen for the full year to March, largely as a result of the fight against Steel Partners. Bull-Dog's market capitalization shrank by 45%, from 32.2 billion yen in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2008/03/10/steel-partners-sapporo-markets-equity-cx_vk_0310markets02.html "Steel Partners Moderates Its Approach To Sapporo"], Forbes.com, 2008-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2008, Sapporo shareholders voted to renew the company's poison pill takeover defense plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=a15xWi2z1ajc&amp;refer=japan "Sapporo, Facing Steel Offer, Renews Takeover Defense"], Bloomberg.com, 2008-03-28&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, Steel Partners sold its remaining stake in Bull-Dog Sauce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUST25213320080418 "Steel Partners exits Japan's Bull-Dog after fight"], Reuters, 2008-04-17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''School Tycoon''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Cat Daddy Games]] and published by [[Global Star Software]] in 2004. The game was designed to appeal to a younger audience as it is easier and less complicated than other [[business simulation game]]s by removing the spreadsheets and statistics of game management.

== Overview ==
The game has an overhead view of a farm, city lot, or beach-side lot where a school is to be built. The player places buildings and paths to create the layout of the school. The objectives in the game increase in difficulty as the player progress; an easy objective might be to get a certain number of students into school while a more difficult objective would be to earn a certain amount of money within a time limit.   There is also a [[Sandbox (video games)|sandbox]] game mode without specific objectives, giving the player the freedom to build any type of school they desire.  The game view can zoom in to select individual students, or zoom out to look at the whole school. The game also has speed controls, to accelerate the pace of events, and has variable difficulty settings.
Students in the school can learn ten different subjects. When starting off a school, the player can only afford small classrooms. As money is earned, better and larger classrooms can be built, helping the students to learn more. The player can build academic buildings, sports facilities, entertainment buildings, and an assortment of other structures such as statues, fountains, and food areas.  It is also possible to hire teachers and coaches with a variety of different skills.

Where representations of a customer are held in more than one [[data set]], achieving a single customer view can be difficult: firstly because customer identity must be traceable between the records held in those systems, and secondly because anomalies or discrepancies in the customer data must be [[data cleansing|data cleansed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atominsight.com/about-us/blog/single-customer-view-hard|title=Why building a single customer view isn’t as easy as you might think|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the acquisition by an organisation of a single customer view is one potential outcome of successful [[master data management]]. Since 31 December, 2010, maintaining a single customer view, and submitting it within 72 hours, has become mandatory for [[financial institution]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] due to new rules introduced by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Experian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fscs.org.uk/industry/single-customer-view/|title=Deposit Guarantee Scheme - Customer Review -FSCS|website=www.fscs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">{{world|date=August 2017}}'''Social dumping''' is a practice of [[employers]] to use cheaper [[workforce|labour]] than is usually available at their site of production or sale. In the latter case, migrant workers are employed; in the former, production is moved to a low-wage country or area. The company will thus save money and potentially increase its [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Systemic criticism suggests that as a result, governments are tempted to enter a so-called ''social policy regime competition'' by reducing their labour and social standards to ease labour costs on enterprises and to retain business activity within their jurisdiction.

There is a controversy around whether social dumping takes advantage of an [[EU directive]] on internal markets, the [[Bolkestein directive]].

Entities losing from social dumping:
* Employees in exporting countries
* Child labor in exporting countries
* Industry and environment in exporting country
* Government in exporting countries
* Employees in importing countries
* Shareholders of the company in importing countries

Entities gaining from social dumping:
* Companies in importing country
* Shareholders in importing country
* Customers in importing country
* Industry in importing market
* Employment in exporting country
* Government and investment in exporting country

The document argues that a vague definition of seasonal work might fail to cover all types of seasonal employment taking place when the Directive exerts its otherwise-welcome protective measures on the labour market.

'''Sir William Appleton''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KStJg|size=85%}} (3 September 1889 – 22 October 1958) was a New Zealand local body politician, advertising agent and leading company director. He was [[Mayor of Wellington City|Mayor of Wellington]] for two terms from 1944 to 1950 after serving as a city councillor from 1931 to 1944. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in [[1950 Birthday Honours|1950]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Appleton was born in [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] in [[Central Otago]] in 1889, the eldest of nine children. His parents were Yorkshireman Edwin Appleton and his Scottish wife, Margaret Bruce. The Appleton family briefly moved to [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] in 1904 but was back in Alexandra in the following year. Appleton, left by the postmaster in charge of the local post office as a teenager, did some bookkeeping for local businesses. In October 1906, aged 17, he was appointed a cadet in the accountancy department of the General Post Office at [[Wellington]]. In 1909 he passed his accountancy exams.&lt;ref name="DNZB Appleton" /&gt;

He left the Post and Telegraph Department, then still a centre of modern communications technology, and in April 1910 joined advertising agent Charles Haines and Co. Haines had founded his business, the country's first [[advertising agency]], in Wellington in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19100423.2.24 ''The Evening Post''] page 5, 23 April 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://teara.govt.nz/en/advertising/page-2 ''Te Ara''] Advertising agencies, 1891–1970&lt;/ref&gt; Will married Mary Helen (Nell) Munro in March 1913. They were to have a daughter and two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Appleton" /&gt; By the time of the [[first world war]] 25-year-old Will Appleton was manager of Charles Haines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19150123.2.20 ''The Evening Post''] page 6, 23 January 1915&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed managing director in 1918. Nell died in 1918's influenza epidemic. The following year he married Rose Hellewell and they had a daughter and two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Appleton" /&gt;

Meanwhile Appleton maintained his local body interests serving on the Wellington Hospital Board from 1923. In 1931 he successfully stood for the Wellington City Council.&lt;ref name="DNZB Appleton" /&gt; Then in 1932 he sold his interest in Charles Haines to his former partners, accepted directorships in many major listed companies and devoted himself to politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19320630.2.107 ''The Evening Post] page 12, 30 June 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

From left: [[Cecil Wood (architect)|Cecil Wood]], [[St Barbe Holland|Herbert St Barbe Holland]] and Appleton discussing plans for the new [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, Wellington|Wellington Cathedral]] in 1945]]
After moving to Wellington, Appleton was elected to the [[Borough of Onslow|Onslow Borough Council]] in 1915 where he led a successful campaign for amalgamation with Wellington in order to gain an integrated water and drainage system.&lt;ref name="DNZB Appleton" /&gt; In 1923 he was elected to the Wellington Hospital Board on a [[Civic League]] ticket and remained a member until 1929.

In [[Wellington City mayoral election, 1931|1931]] Appleton was elected to the [[Wellington City Council]] where he became an effective and popular councillor renowned as being friendly, approachable and possessing a "chuckling" sense of humour. He became chair of the Works Committee and oversaw the introduction of a system of refuse disposal to converted gullies into sports grounds including Appleton Park, which was named after him.&lt;ref name="DNZB Appleton" /&gt;

In [[Wellington City mayoral election, 1944|1944]] Appleton challenged [[Thomas Hislop (mayor)|Thomas Hislop]] for the Citizens' nomination to stand for mayor. Appleton claimed he would stand as an independent should he not be granted the candidacy. Declining arbitration, Appleton got his wish when Hislop (albeit reluctantly) agreed to stand aside in the interests of unity.{{sfn|Betts|1970|pp=180}} Appleton was elected with a huge majority and was later re-elected for a second term in [[Wellington City mayoral election, 1947|1947]] by a lower margin before retiring in 1950.&lt;ref name="Mr. Appleton Mayor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19440529.2.84.4 |work =Evening Post |page=11 |title=Mr. Appleton Mayor|date=29 May 1944 |accessdate= 28 October 2016 | volume=CXXXVII | issue=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Norrie |first=J |date=1 December 1947 |title=Declaration of Election Results |url= |publisher=[[Wellington City Council]] |page= |docket= |access-date=24 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[List of by-elections to the Wellington City Council#1955 by-election|1955 by-election]] Appleton was invited by the Citizens' Association to stand once again for the City Council, though he declined to re-enter local politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interest Aroused in Wellington City Council By-Election |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |date=6 December 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xpress Air''' established itself as a Domestic Regular Airline that offers direct flights to the Eastern parts of Indonesia, with its first leap in the year 2005 and from 2014 served international routes to [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/11/express-air-link-pontianak-and-johor-bahru-weekend.html |title=Express Air to link Pontianak and Johor Bahru this weekend |date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with its two Boeing 737s, Xpress Air became the first privately owned, scheduled airline that connects Jakarta to 24 domestic destinations like Makassar (formerly known as Ujung Pandang), Ternate, Sorong, Manokwari, and Jayapura. Makassar serves as a main hub for all flights coming from Java islands to the Eastern cities of Indonesia, while Sorong serves as a second hub in Papua, connecting remote places surrounding West Papua Area.

Xpress Air is supported by PT Aero Nusantara Indonesia (ANI), a trusted Aircraft Maintenance Provider, ensuring a pledge to safety, quality and security to its passengers.

Express Air is listed in category 1 by Indonesian [[Civil Aviation Authority]] for airline safety quality.&lt;ref&gt;http://hubud.dephub.go.id/?en+news+detail+1464+8&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Express Air begun commercial operations between Jayapura and Jakarta on June 23, 2003. Since then, the airline has grown to become one of the major airlines in Eastern Indonesia. Xpress Air is currently in the process of a major fleet expansion to serve more numbers of destinations along West-East Papua axis, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Nusa Tenggara region. The vision to also offer routes to the western regions has been met as Xpress Air has begun connecting people to Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Kalimantan, Pontianak and more.

The year 2012 embarked a new journey for Xpress Air with a new branding name (from Express Air to Xpress Air to represent a more modern and customer-friendly airline), a new strategy and a fresh new slogan "Terbanglah Indonesia", holding close to its heart the same culture and tradition of a friendly airline with new, modern advancements and motivation
