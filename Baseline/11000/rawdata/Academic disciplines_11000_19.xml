'''A due''' {{IPA-it|a ˈduːe|}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] or '''à deux''' {{IPA-fr|a dø|}} in [[French language|French]] is a musical direction meaning "for two".&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine. ''The [[HarperCollins]] Dictionary of Music, 3rd ed.'' New York: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often seen in its abbreviated form ''a2'', the marking signifies that on a staff that normally carries parts for two players, both players are to play the single part in [[unison]].&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael (ed.). ''Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians.'' Cambridge, London: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally seen in scores and parts where two players or sections of the same instrument share a staff. The instruction ''a2'' indicates that both players or sections should play the notes indicated, while ''primo'' and ''secondo'' (often abbreviated to ''1.'' and ''2.'' or ''I&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''II&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'') indicate that only a single player or section should play while the other remains [[tacet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4376">In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], an '''action group''' or '''task group''' is a group of people joined temporarily to accomplish some task or take part in some organized [[collective action]].

As the members of the action group are brought together on a single occasion and then disband, they cannot be regarded as constituting a full-fledged [[social group]], for which they would need to interact recurrently in accordance with their [[social identity|social identities]].

Action Groups are often formed by many [[shareholder]]s when they disagree with actions by the [[Board of Directors]] of a [[Public Company]] or the [[Government]] like the forced [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/12/22/appeal-bid-denied-for-northern-rock-shareholders-61634-25444230/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225142734/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/12/22/appeal-bid-denied-for-northern-rock-shareholders-61634-25444230/ |archivedate=2009-12-25 }} Appeal bid denied for Northern Rock shareholders".

[[Institutional investor]]s often find loose alliances with private investor lead shareholder association actions groups useful in applying mass political pressure or to publicly embarrass Directors at [[Annual general meeting]]s into making changes.

The largest established shareholder action group associations are Sveriges Aktiesparares Riksförbund (the Swedish Shareholders' Association) part of the Euroshareholders group in the UK ShareSoc and UKSA (UK Shareholder Association),. American Shareholders Association, [[Australian Shareholders Association]], and Japan [[Sōkaiya]] also have action groups.

==In Latin American context==
In Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America, the word "action group" ({{lang|es|grupo de acción}}) was given to violent activists who gathered together to perform violent guerrilla activities e.g. (see [[Antonio Guiteras]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Emilio Tro]], [[Lauro Blanco]], and [[Rolando Masferrer]] when young university students) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050817112813/http://www.cadal.org/articulos/nota.asp?id_nota=290][http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagjs098.php].

{{cosmology}}
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper''', or '''αβγ paper''', was created by [[Ralph Alpher]], then a [[physics]] [[PhD]] student, and his advisor [[George Gamow]]. The work, which would become the subject of Alpher's PhD dissertation, argued that the [[Big Bang]] would create [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and heavier elements in the correct proportions to explain their abundance in the early [[universe]]. While the original theory neglected a number of processes important to the formation of heavy elements, subsequent developments showed that [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] is consistent with the observed constraints on all primordial elements.

Formally titled "The Origin of Chemical Elements", it was published in the April 1948 issue of ''[[Physical Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Bethe's name ==
Gamow humorously decided to add the name of his friend—the eminent physicist [[Hans Bethe]]—to this paper in order to create the whimsical author list of Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, a play on the [[Greek letters]] [[α]], [[Beta (letter)|β]], and [[γ]] (alpha, beta, gamma). Bethe was listed in the article as "H. Bethe, [[Cornell University]], [[Ithaca, New York]]". In his 1952 book, ''The Creation of the Universe'', Gamow explained Hans Bethe's association with the theory thus:

[[File:Alpherbethegamov.gif|left|frame|The αβγ paper with the figure referred to in the text]]
{{quote|The results of these calculations were first announced in a letter to ''The Physical Review'', April 1, 1948. This was signed Alpher, Bethe, and Gamow, and is often referred to as the 'alphabetical article.' It seemed unfair to the Greek alphabet to have the article signed by Alpher and Gamow only, and so the name of Dr. Hans A. Bethe (''in absentia'') was inserted in preparing the manuscript for print. Dr. Bethe, who received a copy of the manuscript, did not object, and, as a matter of fact, was quite helpful in subsequent discussions. There was, however, a rumor that later, when the alpha, beta, gamma theory went temporarily on the rocks, Dr. Bethe seriously considered changing his name to Zacharias.

The close fit of the calculated curve and the observed abundances is shown in Fig. 15, which represents the results of later calculations carried out on the electronic computer of the National Bureau of Standards by Ralph Alpher and [[Robert Herman|R. C. Herman]] (who stubbornly refuses to change his name to Delter.)}}

After this, Bethe did work on [[big bang nucleosynthesis]].

Alpher, at the time only a graduate student, was generally dismayed by the inclusion of Bethe's name on this paper. He felt that the inclusion of another eminent physicist would overshadow his personal contribution to this work and prevent him from receiving proper recognition for such an important discovery. He expressed resentment over Gamow's whimsy as late as 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103060735/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_7_20/ai_55030837 The Last Big Bang Man Left Standing – physicist Ralph Alpher devised Big Bang Theory of universe] (Archive.org mirror), ''Discover'', July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4505414 Discussion of Alpher's role], ''NPR Books'', June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2004/09/22/ecnsing22.xml&amp;sSheet=/connected/2004/09/22/ixconnrite.html The forgotten father of the Big Bang], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 22 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main shortcoming of the theory ==
The theory originally proposed that ''all'' [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are produced by the successive capture of [[neutron]]s, one mass unit at a time. However, later study challenged the universality of the successive capture theory. No element was found to have a stable isotope with an atomic mass of five or eight. Physicists soon noticed that these ''mass gaps'' would hinder the production of elements beyond helium. Just as it's impossible to climb a staircase one step at a time when one of the steps is missing, this discovery meant that the successive capture theory could not account for higher elements.

It was eventually recognized that most of the [[abundance of the chemical elements|heavy elements observed in the present universe]] are the result of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] in stars, a theory first suggested by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]], given credence by [[Hans Bethe]], and quantitatively developed by [[Fred Hoyle]] and a number of other scientists.

However, the Alpher–Bethe–Gamow theory does correctly explain the relative abundances of the isotopes of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. Taken together, these account for more than 99% of the [[baryon]]ic mass of the universe. Today, nucleosynthesis is widely considered to have taken place in two stages: formation of hydrogen and helium according to the Alpher–Bethe–Gamow theory, and stellar nucleosynthesis of higher elements according to Bethe and Hoyle's later theories.

'''Auto-vampirism''' is a form of vampirism that refers to drinking one's own [[blood]], typically as a form of sexual gratification. Although closely related to vampirism, the two differ in that vampirism is a sadistic act while auto-vampirism is on the side of masochism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourguignon|first=A|date=February 1977|title=[Status of vampirism and autovampirism]|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/883741|journal=Annales medico-psychologiques|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|issn=0003-4487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with drinking their own blood, most practitioners of auto-vampirism also engage in [[self-harm]] in order to obtain the blood.&lt;ref&gt;McCully, R. S. (1964). Vampirism: Historical perspective and underlying process in relation to a case of auto-vampirism. ''Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 139,'' 440–451.&lt;/ref&gt;    

V[[Clinical vampirism|ampirism]] also includes any violent or sexual act done to or in the presence of the body of a dead being, not just drinking the blood of a fellow, living human. Auto-vampirism is typically the first stage of [[Clinical vampirism|Clinical Vampirism,]] or more commonly known as Renfield's Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourguignon|first=A|date=1977/02|title=[Status of vampirism and autovampirism]|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/883741|journal=Annales medico-psychologiques|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|issn=0003-4487}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The habit of drinking ones own blood usually begins during childhood, most commonly as a result of a traumatic event that results in a person linking pleasure with violence and more specifically blood. It develops by first scraping or cutting one's own skin to extract and ingest blood, later resulting in learning where and how to cut and open major [[Vein|veins]] and [[Artery|arteries]] for larger amounts of blood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olry|first=Régis|last2=Haines|first2=Duane E.|date=2011-10|title=Renfield's Syndrome: A Psychiatric Illness Drawn from Bram Stoker'sDracula|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F0964704X.2011.595655|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=368–371|doi=10.1080/0964704x.2011.595655|issn=0964-704X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sometimes, they will also store their own blood for later consumption or just because they like to look at it. Eventually, auto-vampirism develops into clinical vampirism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218202138/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html|title=Vampire Killers - murderers who were inspired by a lust for blood - The Crime library|date=2007-12-18|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child goes through puberty, they begin to link sexuality to the pleasure that is already derived from vampirism. There is also usually a sense that seeing or drinking their blood gives them power or increased health, as in general vampirism. At this point, it is considered fetishistic.

There are cases where vampirism and auto-vampirism are one of many symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. This was illustrated in the case of a 35- year old woman with schizophrenia who experienced severe depersonalization and auditory hallucinations that commanded her to drink her own blood. Auto-vampirism, for her, was part of a delusion about a purification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Hans Mørch|last2=Poulsen|first2=Henrik Day|date=January 2002|title=Auto-vampirism in schizophrenia|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08039480252803918?src=recsys|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=56|issue=1|pages=47–48|doi=10.1080/08039480252803918|issn=0803-9488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auto-vampirism can cause anemia, abdominal pain, nausea, and more. It's difficult to determine all the consequences of auto-vampirism due to the difficulty of finding people who drink their own blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jali|first=H M|date=1989-10|title=Tuberculous Anal Ulcer|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107688908201026|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|language=en|volume=82|issue=10|pages=629–630|doi=10.1177/014107688908201026|issn=0141-0768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azal''' (אצל), or '''Azel''', is a location mentioned in the [[Book of Zechariah]] 14:5, in Bibles that use the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]] as the source for this verse. In Bibles that follow the Greek [[Septuagint]] ([[LXX]]) rendering, depending upon the source manuscript used, ''Azal'' is transcribed ''Jasol'' (ιασολ, pronounced "Yasol"), ''Jasod'' (a corruption of ''Jasol''), or ''Asael'' (ασαηλ):

{{quote|''And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto ''Azal'': yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of [[Uzziah]] king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].''|source={{Bibleverse||Zechariah|14:5|KJV}} [[King James Version]]}}

{{quote|''The valley between the hills will be filled in, yes, it will be blocked as far as ''Jasol'', it will be filled in as it was by the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah'',|source={{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=45&amp;bible_chapter=14|title=Zechariah 14:5|publisher=[[New Jerusalem Bible]]|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}}}

== Theories on location ==

No written work prior to the late 19th-century definitively identifies what, or where, Azal is or was. Most Bible commentators of the late 19th century considered it to be a place near [[Jerusalem]].  [[Cyril of Alexandria]] wrote in his commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]], Chapter 14. that Azal was known to be “a town situated at the far point of the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Cyril | last=Alexandria | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lG_NF6CrjtcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=a+town+situated+at+the+far+point+of+the+mountain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fPZjpAt7Ba&amp;sig=NvAQJgqzXKB8N7VcHP2l0YKIGcM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI--assLmXxwIVDJ2ICh1CYgRr#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20town%20situated%20at%20the%20far%20point%20of%20the%20mountain&amp;f=false | editor-last = Hill | editor-first = Robert C.| series = | title = Commentary on the Twelve Prophets, Volume 3 | at = pp. 259-60 | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, Palestinian [[geographer]] {{ill|Rabbbi Joseph Schwarz|he|יהוסף שוורץ}}&lt;ref name=Schwarz&gt;{{Cite report|last=Schwarz|first=Joseph|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13342-schwarz-joseph|title=SCHWARZ, JOSEPH |date =1890|work =[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Azal was modern Azaria, situated a half mile southeast of the southernmost peak of the [[Mount of Olives]] (then called Mount Corruption).&lt;ref name=Palestine&gt;{{Cite report|last=Schwarz|first=Joseph|url=http://www.jewish-history.com/palestine/moriah.html|title=Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Sketch of Palestine |date =1850|work =Jewishhistory.com|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Orientalist and archaeologist [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]], who identified the site of the ancient [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Gezer]] preserving the [[Mesha Stele]]'s inscriptions&lt;ref name=Gezer&gt;{{Cite report|last=Pelgrift|first=Henry|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/853/|title=The History of Excavations at Tel Gezer |date =January 12, 2016|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Schwarz was referring to [[al-Eizariya]], the traditional [[Bethany]] of New Testament times. However, al-Eizariya lies several kilometers due east of the [[Mount of Olives]], not a half mile southeast of it, as Schwarz claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clermont-Ganneau |first=Charles |date=1896 |title=Archaeological researches in Palestine during the years 1873–1874 |url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologicalre02cler |location=[[Internet Archive]] |publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |page=251-255; 275 |ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1873 and 1874, Clermont-Ganneau explored many tombs in a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which the peasants of [[Silwan]] called {{transl|ar|Wady Yasul}}. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Clermont-Ganneau proposed that Wady Yasul is Azal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine'', Vol. 1. pg. 420, 1899; Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, April 1874, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this valley is bordered on the west by the Jerusalem [[Peace Forest]] and the neighborhood of [[Talpiot]], on the north by the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood on the southern slope of the Hill of Evil Council, and on the south by the neighborhood of [[Jabel Mukaber]] on the ridge where the former UN headquarters sits. The mouth of the valley lies at the base of the southernmost summit of the Mount of Olives (Mount of Corruption). Its Hebrew name is {{transl|he|Nahal Atzal}} ({{lang|he|נחל אצל}}).

There is evidence that Clermont-Ganneau's theory and the ''LXX'' rendering of Zechariah 14:5 are correct. In 1984, Israeli geologists Daniel Wachs and Dov Levitte identified the location of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives that is directly adjacent to both Wady Yasul (Nahal Atzal) and the area of the ancient King's Gardens at the juncture of the [[Hinnom]] and [[Kidron Valley]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wachs |first1= Daniel |last2= Levitte|first2= Dov |year= 1984|title=Earthquake Risk and Slope Stability in Jerusalem |journal=Environmental Geology and Water Sciences |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=183–186 |publisher= |doi=10.1007/BF02509912 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t1323l6j20248l21/ |accessdate=November 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wachs' and Levitte's discovery validates Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]]' account of an earthquake-caused landslide during King [[Uzziah]]'s reign blocking up the kings' gardens in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', book 9, chapter 10, paragraph 4, verse 225, William Whiston&lt;/ref&gt; It also accords with the ''LXX'' rendering of Zechariah 14:5, which states a valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. Additionally, the Israelis officially named this valley '''אצל''' (Atzal), which is the same Hebrew spelling of Azal ('''אצל''').

[[Image:ABO blood type.svg|thumb|right|410px|Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.]]
A '''blood type''' (also called a '''blood group''') is a classification of [[blood]], based on the presence and absence of [[antibodies]] and [[Heredity|inherited]] [[antigen]]ic substances on the surface of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs). These antigens may be [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[glycoprotein]]s, or [[glycolipid]]s, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cell]]s of various [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one [[allele]] (or an alternative version of a gene) and collectively form a blood group system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Maton  | first = Anthea  |author2=Jean Hopkins|author3=Charles William McLaughlin|author4=Susan Johnson|author5=Maryanna Quon Warner|author6=David LaHart|author7=Jill D.

Bone-marrow transplants are performed for many [[leukemias]] and [[lymphomas]], among other diseases. If a person receives bone marrow from someone who is a different ABO type (e.g., a type A patient receives a type O bone marrow), the patient's blood type will eventually convert to the donor's type.

Some blood types are associated with inheritance of other diseases; for example, the [[Kell blood group system|Kell antigen]] is sometimes associated with [[McLeod syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--

===ABO blood group system===
[[Image:ABO blood group diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|''ABO blood group system'': diagram showing the carbohydrate chains that determine the ABO blood group]]
{{Main|ABO blood group system}}

The ABO blood group system involves two antigens and two antibodies found in human blood. The two antigens are antigen A and antigen B. The two antibodies are antibody A and antibody B. The antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum. Regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into 4 groups, those with antigen A (group A), those with antigen B (group B), those with both antigen A and B (group AB) and those with neither antigen (group O). The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:
# Antigen	A	with antibody  B
# Antigen	B	with antibody  A
# Antigen	AB	has no antibodies
# Antigen 	nil (group O) with antibody A and B.

There is an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.

The ''ABO system'' is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually ''[[immunoglobulin M]]'', abbreviated [[IgM]], antibodies. ABO IgM [[antibodies]] are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The original terminology used by [[Karl Landsteiner]] in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications "C" became "O".&lt;ref name=Oor0&gt;{{Citation | last1  = Schmidt | first1 = P | last2  = Okroi | first2 = M  | title = Also sprach Landsteiner – Blood Group ‘O’ or Blood Group ‘NULL’ | journal = Infus Ther Transfus Med | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 206–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = | doi = 10.1159/000050239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type O is often called ''0'' (''zero'', or ''null'') in other languages.&lt;ref name="Oor0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |title=Your blood&amp;nbsp;– a textbook about blood and blood donation |accessdate=2008-07-15 |format=PDF |work= |page=63 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626184746/http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rh blood group system===
{{Main|Rh blood group system}}
The Rh system (Rh meaning ''[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus]]'') is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances.  However, D-negative individuals can produce [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s.&lt;ref name="Talaro, Kathleen P. 2005 510–1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Talaro, Kathleen P.|title=Foundations in microbiology|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages=510–1|isbn=0-07-111203-0 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rh disease]] can develop in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moise KJ|title=Management of rhesus alloimmunization in pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=112|issue=1|pages=164–76|date=July 2008|pmid=18591322|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d453c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).&lt;ref name="Rh group and its origin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hospital.kingnet.com.tw/activity/blood/html/a.html|title=Rh血型的由來|publisher=Hospital.kingnet.com.tw|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or − sign, so that, for example, the A− group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.

===ABO and Rh distribution by country===
{{main|Blood type distribution by country}}

As with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations.

===Other blood group systems===
{{Main|Human blood group systems}}
28 blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the common ABO and Rh systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmpr/?Page=news&amp;storyID=13259
|title=Blood Mystery Solved
|author=Joshua E. Brown
|date=22 February 2012
|publisher=University Of Vermont
|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in addition to the ABO antigens and Rh antigens, many other antigens are expressed on the RBC surface membrane. For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, and at the same time M and N positive ([[MNS antigen system|MNS system]]), K positive ([[Kell antigen system|Kell system]]), Le&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; or Le&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; negative ([[Lewis antigen system|Lewis system]]), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.

==Clinical significance==

===Blood transfusion===
{{Main|Blood transfusion}}
Transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of [[hematology]] that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a [[blood bank]] to provide a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed [[physician]] or [[surgeon]]) in a similar way as medicines.

[[File:Main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction.png|thumb|right|220px|Main symptoms of [[acute hemolytic reaction]] due to blood type mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_4x_Possible_Risks_of_Blood_Product_Transfusions.asp Possible Risks of Blood Product Transfusions] from American Cancer Society. Last Medical Review: 03/08/2008. Last Revised: 01/13/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu/bloodbank/manual/bbch_7/index.html 7 adverse reactions to transfusion] Pathology Department at University of Michigan. Version July 2004, Revised 11/5/08&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Much of the routine work of a [[blood bank]] involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible.   If a unit of incompatible blood is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] between a [[Blood donation|donor]] and recipient, a severe [[acute hemolytic reaction]] with [[hemolysis]] (RBC destruction), [[renal failure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the [[complement system]] to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.

Patients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a [[transfusion reaction]].  Risks can be further reduced by [[cross-matching]] blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture ''agglutinates'', or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with a [[microscope]]. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient.  In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a [[barcode]] system known as [[ISBT 128]].

The blood group may be included on [[Dog tag (identifier)|identification tags]] or on [[tattoo]]s worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German [[SS blood group tattoo|Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos]] during [[World War II]].

Rare blood types can cause supply problems for [[blood bank]]s and hospitals. For example, [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]]-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickel RG |title=Determination of Duffy genotypes in three populations of African descent using PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotides |journal=Human Immunology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=738–42 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10439320 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00039-7 |author2=Willadsen SA |author3=Freidhoff LR |display-authors=3 |last4=Huang |first4=Shau-Ku |last5=Caraballo |first5=Luis |last6=Naidu |first6=Raana P |last7=Levett |first7=Paul |last8=Blumenthal |first8=Malcolm |last9=Banks-Schlegel |first9=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients.  Similarly for RhD negative people, there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly [[East Asia]], where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodcare.org.uk/html/resources_chairman_2001.htm |title=BCF&amp;nbsp;– Members&amp;nbsp;– Chairman's Annual Report |accessdate=2008-07-15 |last=Bruce |first=MG |date=May 2002 |publisher=The Blood Care Foundation |quote=As Rhesus Negative blood is rare amongst local nationals, this Agreement will be of particular value to Rhesus Negative expatriates and travellers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410111425/http://www.bloodcare.org.uk/html/resources_chairman_2001.htm |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)===
{{Main|Hemolytic disease of the newborn}}
[[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women may carry a [[fetus]] with a blood type which is different from their own. In those cases, the mother can make [[IgG]] blood group antibodies. This can happen if some of the fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]].  This can cause [[Rh disease]] or other forms of [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies.  Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus; in these cases it is called [[hydrops fetalis]].&lt;ref name =Letsky2000&gt;{{cite book |title =Antenatal &amp; neonatal screening |edition = 2nd |chapter = Chapter 12: Rhesus and other haemolytic diseases |author = E.A.

=== Blood products ===
To provide maximum benefit from each blood donation and to extend shelf-life, [[blood bank]]s [[blood fractionation|fractionate]] some whole blood into several products. The most common of these products are packed RBCs, [[Blood plasma|plasma]], [[platelet]]s, [[cryoprecipitate]], and [[Blood plasma#Fresh frozen plasma|fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP).  FFP is quick-frozen to retain the labile [[clotting factor]]s [[Factor V|V]] and [[Factor VIII|VIII]], which are usually administered to patients who have a potentially fatal clotting problem caused by a condition such as advanced [[liver]] disease, overdose of [[anticoagulant]], or [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).

Units of packed red cells are made by removing as much of the plasma as possible from whole blood units.

[[Clotting factors]] synthesized by modern [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] methods are now in routine clinical use for [[hemophilia]], as the risks of infection transmission that occur with pooled blood products are avoided.

===Red blood cell compatibility===
*'''Blood group AB'''  individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their [[blood plasma]] does not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen. Therefore, an individual with type AB blood can receive blood from any group (with AB being preferable), but cannot donate blood to any group other than AB.  They are known as universal recipients.
*'''Blood group A'''  individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing [[IgM]] antibodies against the B antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB.
*'''Blood group B'''  individuals have the B antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or O (with B being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type B or AB.
*'''Blood group O''' (or blood group zero in some countries) individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood serum contains IgM anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Therefore, a group O individual can receive blood only from a group O individual, but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (i.e., A, B, O or AB). If a patient in a hospital situation needs a blood transfusion in an emergency, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be issued. Because it is compatible with anyone, O negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply.&lt;ref name="AABBfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Association of Blood Banks |author1-link = American Association of Blood Banks |date = 24 April 2014 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Association of Blood Banks |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-association-of-blood-banks/ |accessdate = 25 July 2014}}, which cites

1. Assumes absence of atypical antibodies that would cause an incompatibility between donor and recipient blood, as is usual for blood selected by cross matching.
&lt;/small&gt;

An Rh D-negative patient who does not have any anti-D antibodies (never being previously sensitized to D-positive RBCs) can receive a transfusion of D-positive blood once, but this would cause sensitization to the D antigen, and a female patient would become at risk for [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]].  If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.

This same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.

===Plasma compatibility===
[[File:Plasma donation compatibility path.svg|right|190px|thumb|'''Plasma compatibility chart'''&lt;br /&gt;In addition to donating to the same blood group; plasma from type AB can be given to A, B and O; plasma from types A, B and AB can be given to O.]]
[[Blood plasma]] compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Component ABO Compatibility Chart Red Blood Cells and Plasma|url=http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu|website=Blood Bank Labsite|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma. Type O carries both antibodies, so individuals of blood group O can receive plasma from any blood group, but type O plasma can be used only by type O recipients.
&lt;!--Please don't switch donor and recipient here without being absolutely sure they're wrong. Check the cited source; any change must match it. It seems a lot of people switch this without actually understanding it, because it's often edited from the correct (AB can donate plasma to all blood groups) to the wrong.--&gt;

1. Assumes absence of strong atypical antibodies in donor plasma
&lt;/small&gt;

Rh D antibodies are uncommon, so generally neither D negative nor D positive blood contain anti-D antibodies.  If a potential donor is found to have anti-D antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank, they would not be accepted as a donor (or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled); therefore, donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of D antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies, and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be D positive or D negative, as long as blood plasma and the recipient are ABO compatible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Universal donors and universal recipients===
[[File:US Navy 060105-N-8154G-010 A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from Portsmouth Naval Hospital takes samples of blood from a donor for testing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A hospital corpsman with the Blood Donor Team from [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth]] takes samples of blood from a donor for testing]]

In transfusions of packed red blood cells, individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with [[hh antigen system]] (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine |last=Fauci |first=Anthony S. |author2=Eugene Braunwald|author3=Kurt J. Isselbacher|author4=Jean D. Wilson|author5=Joseph B. Martin|author6=Dennis L. Kasper|author7=Stephen L. Hauser|author8=Dan L. Longo |year=1998 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-020291-5 |page=719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/blood-type-test |title=Universal acceptor and donor groups |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood donors with exceptionally strong anti-A, anti-B or any atypical blood group antibody may be excluded from blood donation. In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.

Additionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response.  Transfusions are further complicated because [[platelet]]s and [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.

For transfusions of [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]], this situation is reversed.  Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients.  The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type.  Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.

==Antibody-free blood typing==
Typically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by [[Hemagglutination|agglutination]]. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at [[Imperial College London]] which makes use of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[molecularly imprinted polymer]] nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Piletsky SS, Rabinowicz S, Yang Z, Piletska EV, Guerreiro A, Piletsky SA |title= Development of molecularly imprinted polymers specific for blood antigens for application in antibody-free blood typing |journal=Chemical Communications |issue=11|year= 2017|doi= 10.1039/C6CC08716G| pages=1793–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.

==Blood group genotyping==
In addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anstee DJ |title=Red cell genotyping and the future of pretransfusion testing |journal=Blood |volume=114|issue=2|year= 2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-11-146860|pmid=19411635| pages=248–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Avent ND |title=Large-scale blood group genotyping: clinical implications |journal=Br J Haematol |volume=144|issue=1|year= 2009|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07285.x|pmid=19016734| pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Karl Landsteiner, 1920s..jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Landsteiner]]]]
Blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician [[Karl Landsteiner]] working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now [[Medical University of Vienna]]). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Zentralblatt für Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde und Infektionskrankheiten|volume=27 |issue= |pages=357–362 |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a two-sentence footnote:

{{Quote|The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals. It remains to be seen whether this appearance is related to inborn differences between individuals or it is the result of some damage of bacterial kind.&lt;ref name=kantha&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kantha |first1=S.S. |title=The blood revolution initiated by the famous footnote of Karl Landsteiner's 1900 paper |journal=The Ceylon Medical Journal |date=1995 |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=123–125 |pmid=8536328 |url=https://www1.gifu-u.ac.jp/~srikanth/srikantha_library/file/History%20of%20science/Landsteiner%20blood%20revolution%201995.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was the first evidence that blood variation exists in humans. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=Karl |title=On Agglutination of Normal Human Blood |journal=Transfusion |date=1961 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1961.tb00005.x |orig-year=1901 |pmid=13758692| postscript=Originally published in German in ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift'', '''46''', 1132–1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. (C was later renamed to O after the German ''Ohne'', meaning without, or zero, or null.&lt;ref name="farhud"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farhud |first1=D.D. |last2=Zarif Yeganeh |first2=M. |title=A brief history of human blood groups |journal=Iranian Journal of Public Health |date=2013 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |pmid=23514954 |pmc=3595629}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The group AB was discovered a year later by Landsteiner's students Adriano Sturli, and Alfred von Decastello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Decastello |first1=A. |last2=Sturli |first2=A. |title=Concerning isoagglutinins in serum of healthy and sick humans |journal=Munchener Medizinische Wochenschrift |date=1902 |volume=26 |pages=1090–1095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farr1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farr AD |title=Blood group serology—the first four decades (1900–1939) |journal=Medical History |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=215–26 |date=April 1979 |pmid=381816 |pmc=1082436 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300051383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Blood type personality theory}}
A popular belief in Japan is that a person's ABO blood type is predictive of their [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[moral character|character]], and [[Interpersonal compatibility|compatibility with others]]. This belief is also widespread in [[South Korea]]&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=17166&amp;channel_id=1000 |title=Despite scientific debunking, in Japan you are what your blood type is |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MediResource Inc. |accessdate=2011-08-13 |date=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928021954/http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=17166&amp;channel_id=1000 |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taiwan]]. The theory reached Japan in a 1927 psychologist's report, and the government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding better soldiers.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Interest in the theory faded in the 1930s. Ultimately, the discovery of [[DNA]] in the following decades indicated that DNA instead had an important role in both heredity generally and personality specifically.  Interest in the theory was revived in the 1970s by [[Masahiko Nomi]], a broadcaster with a background in law rather than science.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;  The theory is widely accepted in Japanese and South Korean popular culture.&lt;ref name=Nuwer&gt;{{cite web|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|title=You are what you bleed: In Japan and other east Asian countries some believe blood type dictates personality|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/02/15/you-are-what-you-bleed-in-japan-and-other-east-asian-countries-some-believe-blood-type-dictates-personality/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=16 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bläserklasse''' ("blowing class") is a [[Music education|musical education]] class which specialises in wind instruments, i.e. the [[woodwind]]s and [[Brass instrument|brass]]. All students spend usually at least 2 years studying an instrument, with the class forming a wind [[orchestra]] made up of an amalgamation of woodwind and brass instruments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">From 2004-2014, the '''Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project''' annually rated the level of government respect for a variety of internationally recognized human rights. The final CIRI data set contains quantitative indicators of 15 human rights for 195 countries, annually from 1981-2011. The CIRI data were used in over 170 countries by scholars, students, policymakers, and analysts representing over 400 organizations. CIRI's founders and co-directors were political scientists Dr. [[David Cingranelli]] at [[Binghamton University]], SUNY &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/political-science/faculty/david-cingranelli.html David L.

CIRI's data, documentation, and blog posts were archived at [http://www.humanrightsdata.com www.humanrightsdata.com].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsdata.com CIRI Human Rights Data Project], website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing the data==

The CIRI data were free for not-for-profit users. Once registered, CIRI users could create customized datsets, choosing only the indicators, countries, and years they needed; or, they could download the entire data set. As of December 2007, CIRI began using its own numeric country identifier code, but continued to offer others for the purpose of data merging. The MyCIRI feature allowed users to store their datasets on the CIRI server and easily update them when the master CIRI data was updated.

==Financial support==

Financial support for the CIRI Data Project came from the United States' [[National Science Foundation]];&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation Grant Nos. SBR-9730130 (1997-1998), SES-0318273 (2004-2006), SES-0647969 (2007-2010), and SES-0647916 (2007-2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Bank]]; [[GTZ]]; [[Binghamton University]], SUNY; the Center on Democratic Performance at Binghamton University, SUNY; The Human Rights Institute and College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences at [[The University of Connecticut]].

==CIRI human rights indicators==

The CIRI database coded only human rights PRACTICES of governments. The human rights for which government levels of respect were annually rated by CIRI included:

* Assembly &amp; Association
* Disappearance
* Domestic Movement
* Electoral Self-Determination (formerly Political Participation &amp; Free and Fair Elections)
* Empowerment Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for electoral self-determination, domestic movement, foreign movement, religion, speech, assembly &amp; association, and workers' rights)
* Extrajudicial Killing
* Foreign Movement
* Independence of the Judiciary
* Physical Integrity Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for disappearance, extrajudicial killing, political imprisonment, and torture)
* Political Imprisonment
* Religion
* Speech
* Torture
* Women's Economic Rights
* Women's Political Rights
* Women's Social Rights
* Workers' Rights

Most of the CIRI indicators were ratings (as opposed to rankings) on a scale of 0-2 for their respect of human rights, as follows:

*0= Frequent violations of this right
*1= Some violations of this right
*2= No reported violations of this right

The CIRI database used the annual country reports from the US State Department and Amnesty International as its primary sources.

&lt;!--as Carl May redirects here--&gt;
'''Carl May''' [[FAcSS]] (born 1961, in [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sociology|sociologist]]. He researches in the fields of [[medical sociology]] and [[science and technology studies]] (STS). Formerly based at [[Newcastle University]], he is now Professor of Healthcare Innovation at the [[University of Southampton]]. Carl May was elected an [[Academician]] of the [[Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences]] in 2006. He was appointed an  NIHR Senior Investigator in 2010. His work falls into two distinct themes.

In [[medical sociology]] he has researched and published mainly on professional-patient interaction and relationships in clinical settings. This work has its roots in  [[social constructionism]] and the social theory of [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;May, C. 1992. "Individual care? Power and subjectivity in therapeutic relationships." Sociology 26:589-602.May, C. 1992. "Nursing Work, Nurses' Knowledge, and the Subjectification of the Patient." Sociology of Health and Illness 14:472-487&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade his work has become more focused on the ways that interaction processes are embedded in, and represent, their socio-technical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;May, Carl (2007) "The clinical encounter and the problem of context." Sociology 41:29-45.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to studies of the interaction between health technologies and their users. These studies have explored the sociology of [[telemedicine]]&lt;ref&gt;May, C.  (2006) "Mobilizing modern facts: Health Technology Assessment and the politics of evidence." Sociology of Health &amp; Illness 28:513-532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C, T Rapley, T Moreira, T Finch, and B Heaven. (2006) "Technogovernance: Evidence, subjectivity, and the clinical encounter in primary care medicine." Social Science &amp; Medicine 62:1022-1030.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later paper, he argues that the benefits of telemedicine does not outweigh the additional burden on patients and their social support networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cantechletter.com/2016/02/tech-can-help-solve-rural-canadas-health-care-problems-says-study/|title=Tech can help solve rural Canada’s health care problems, says study - Cantech Letter|date=2016-02-27|work=Cantech Letter|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=May|first=Carl R|date=2015-04-23|title=Making sense of technology adoption in healthcare: meso-level considerations|url=https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0305-8|journal=BMC Medicine|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s12916-015-0305-8|issn=1741-7015|pmc=4407548|pmid=25902829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Science and Technology Studies]] his work investigates how innovations become routinely embedded in health care and other organizational systems. This research has led to [[Normalization Process Theory]], developed with Tracey Finch and others, including [[Victor Montori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=May|first=Carl R |last2=Mair|first2=Frances|last3=Finch|first3=Tracy|last4=MacFarlane|first4=Anne|last5=Dowrick|first5=Christopher|last6=Treweek|first6=Shaun|last7=Rapley|first7=Tim|last8=Ballini|first8=Luciana|last9=Ong|first9=Bie Nio|date=2009-05-21|title=Development of a theory of implementation and integration: Normalization Process Theory|url=https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-4-29|journal=Implementation Science|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1748-5908-4-29|issn=1748-5908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a [[sociological theory]] of the [[implementation]], embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational [[innovations]].&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009.

Pescosolido, et al., Eds.), Handbook of the Sociology of Health, Illness, and Healing: A Blueprint for the 21st Century. Springer, New York, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is founded on, and has superseded, an earlier [[Normalization Process Model]]&lt;ref&gt;May, Carl (2006). "A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care." BMC Health Services Research 6:1-11.[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/6/86]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C et al. (2007). "Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model." BMC Health Services Research 7 [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/7/148]&lt;/ref&gt; for evaluating [[randomized controlled trials]], health technologies, and complex interventions  in health care. Most recently,May and colleagues have applied Normalization Process Theory to explaining patient non-compliance with treatment, proposing that a proportion of non-compliance is structurally induced by healthcare systems themselves as patients are overburdened by treatment. To counter this, they have proposed [[Minimally Disruptive Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;May C, Montori VM, Mair FS. We need minimally disruptive medicine. BMJ 2009;339:b2803&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to take account of its effects on patients' workload.

In some animal cells, the protein [[spectrin]] may be present in the cortex. Spectrin helps to create a network by cross-linked actin filaments.&lt;ref name='Alberts' /&gt; The proportions of spectrin and actin vary with cell type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Machnicka B, Grochowalska R, Bogusławska DM, Sikorski AF, Lecomte MC | title = Spectrin-based skeleton as an actor in cell signaling | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–201 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21877118 | pmc = 3249148 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-011-0804-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectrin proteins and actin microfilaments are attached to transmembrane proteins by attachment proteins between them and the transmembrane proteins. The cell cortex is attached to the inner [[cytosol]]ic face of the [[plasma membrane]] in cells where the spectrin proteins and actin microfilaments form a mesh-like structure that is continuously remodeled by [[polymerization]], [[depolymerization]] and branching.

Many proteins are involved in the cortex regulation and dynamics including [[formins]] with roles in actin polymerization, [[Arp2/3 complex|Arp2/3]] complexes that give rise to actin branching and [[F-actin capping protein|capping proteins]]. Due to the branching process and the density of the actin cortex, the cortical [[cytoskeleton]] can form a highly complex meshwork such as a [[fractal]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadegh S, Higgins JL, Mannion PC, Tamkun MM, Krapf D | title = Plasma Membrane is Compartmentalized by a Self-Similar Cortical Actin Meshwork | journal = Physical Review X | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28690919 | pmc = 5500227 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialized cells are usually characterized by a very specific cortical actin cytoskeleton.

In [[plant cell]]s, the cell cortex is reinforced by cortical [[microtubule]]s underlying the plasma membrane. The direction of these cortical microtubules determines which way the cell elongates when it grows.

A '''Chemist In Training''' ('''CIT''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] designation for someone who has obtained a [[academic degree|degree]] from an accredited institution that qualifies for registration with one of the provincial or territorial chemical professional associations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; but has not yet achieved the additional requirements (like relevant supervised work experience) to become accredited as a [[Professional Chemist]] (P.Chem.).

==Licensure==
A licensed CIT is certified to work in a [[chemistry]] profession. Upon completing a certain amount of work experience under the supervision of a Licensed Professional Chemist (P.Chem.) as determined by a [[licensing board]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pchem.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101620/http://www.ocq.qc.ca/fr/ |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpo.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; a CIT is then eligible to gain experience by supervision from a P.Chem.

While being a certified CIT may help in obtaining a chemistry related job, it is not typically required to do chemistry work. All work performed by an CIT must still be checked and certified by a P.Chem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22440">In [[spectroscopy]], '''collision-induced absorption and emission''' refers to spectral features generated by [[inelastic collision]]s of molecules in a gas. Such inelastic collisions (along with the absorption or emission of photons) may induce [[transition of state|quantum transition]]s in the molecules, or the molecules may form transient supramolecular complexes with spectral features different from the underlying molecules.  Collision-induced absorption and emission is particularly important in dense gases, such as hydrogen and helium clouds in found in astronomical systems.

Collision-induced absorption and emission is distinguished from collisional broadening in spectroscopy in that collisional broadening comes from elastic collisions of molecules, whereas collision-induced absorption and emission is an inherently inelastic process.

== Collision-induced spectra of gases ==

Ordinary spectroscopy is concerned with the spectra of single atoms or molecules. Here we outline the very different spectra of [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] consisting of two or more interacting [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s: the "interaction-induced" or "collision-induced" spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Frommhold|title=Collision-induced Absorption in Gases|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|origyear=1993|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ordinary and collision-induced spectra may be observed in emission and absorption and require an electric or magnetic [[multipole moment]] - in most cases an [[electric dipole moment]] - to exist for an [[optical transition]] to take place from an initial to a final [[quantum state]] of a molecule or a [[molecular complex]]. (For brevity of expression we will use here the term "molecule" interchangeably for atoms as well as molecules). A complex of interacting molecules may consist of two or more molecules in a collisional encounter, or else of a weakly bound [[van der Waals molecule]]. On first sight, it may seem strange to treat optical transitions of a collisional complex, which may exist just momentarily, for the duration of a fly-by encounter (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; [[second]]s), in much the same way as this was long done for molecules in ordinary spectroscopy. But even transient complexes of molecules may be viewed as a new, "supermolecular" system which is subject to the same spectroscopic rules as ordinary molecules. Ordinary molecules may be viewed as complexes of atoms that have new and possibly quite different spectroscopic properties than the individual atoms the molecule consists of, when the atoms are not bound together as a molecule (or are not "interacting"). Similarly, complexes of interacting molecules may (and usually do) acquire new optical properties, which often are absent in the non-interacting, well separated individual molecules.

Collision-induced absorption (CIA) and emission (CIE) spectra are well known in the microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, but they occur in special cases also in the visible and near ultraviolet regions.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Abel|author2=L. Frommhold|title=Collision-induced spectra and current astronomical research|journal=Canadian Journal of Physics|volume=91|issue=11|pages=857–869|origyear=1991|year=2013|doi = 10.1139/cjp-2012-0532|bibcode=2013CaJPh..91..857A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collision-induced spectra have been observed in nearly all dense gases, and also in many liquids and solids.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. L. Hunt|author2= J. D. Poll.|title=A second bibliography on collision induced absorption|work=Molec. Phys.|volume= 59|pages= 163&amp;ndash;164, Publication 1/86|year=1986|location=Department of Physics, University of Guelph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite book|editor=G. Birnbaum|title=Phenomena Induced by Intermolecular Interactions|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA and CIE are due to the intermolecular interactions, which generate electric dipole moments. We note that an analogous collision-induced light scattering 
(CILS) or Raman process also exists, which is well studied and is in many ways completely analogous to CIA and CIE. CILS arises from interaction-induced polarizability increments of molecular complexes; the excess polarizability of a complex, relative the sum of polarizabilities of the noninteracting molecules.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. Borysow|author2= L. Frommhold|title=Collision induced light scattering - a bibliography.|work=Adv. Chem. Phys.|volume= 75|pages= 439&amp;ndash;505|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interaction-induced dipoles ==

Molecules interact at close range through intermolecular forces (the "van der Waals 
forces"), which cause minute shifts of the electron density distributions (relative 
the distributions of electrons when the molecules are not interacting). 
Intermolecular forces are repulsive at near range, where electron exchange 
forces dominate the interaction, and attractive at somewhat greater separations, 
where the dispersion forces are active. (If separations are further increased, all 
intermolecular forces fall off rapidly and may be totally neglected.) 
Repulsion and attraction are due, respectively, to the small defects or 
excesses of electron densities of molecular complexes in the space 
between the interacting molecules, which often result in interaction-induced 
electric dipole moments that contribute some to interaction-induced emission and 
absorption intensities. The resulting dipoles are referred to as exchange 
force-induced dipole and dispersion force-induced dipoles, respectively.

Other dipole induction mechanisms also exist in molecular (as opposed to 
monatomic) gases and in mixtures of gases, when molecular gases are present. 
Molecules have centers of positive charge (the nuclei), which are surrounded by
a cloud of electrons. Molecules thus may be thought of being surrounded by various 
electric multipolar fields which will polarize any collisional partner 
momentarily in a fly-by encounter, generating the so-called multipole-induced 
dipoles. In diatomic molecules such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the lowest-order 
multipole moment is the quadrupole, followed by a hexadecapole, etc., hence the 
quadrupole-induced, hexadecapole-induced,... dipoles. Especially the former is often
the strongest, most significant of the induced dipoles contributing to CIA and CIE. 
Other induced dipole mechanisms exist. In collisional systems involving 
molecules of three or more atoms (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;...), collisional frame 
distortion may be an important induction mechanism.&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; Collision-induced 
emission and absorption by simultaneous collisions of three or more particles 
generally do involve pairwise-additive dipole components, as well as important 
irreducible dipole contributions and their spectra.&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Moraldi|author2= L. Frommhold|title=Dipole moments induced in three interacting molecules.|work=J. Molec. Liquids|volume=70|pages=143&amp;ndash;158|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical sketch ==

Collision-induced absorption was first reported in compressed oxygen gas in 1949 
by Harry Welsch and associates at frequencies of the fundamental band of the 
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. F. Crawford|author2=H. L. Welsh|author3=J. L. Locke|title=Infrared absorption of oxygen and nitrogen induced by intermolecular forces|journal= Phys. Rev.|volume= 75|issue=10|page=1607|year=1949|bibcode=1949PhRv...75.1607C|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1607}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that an unperturbed O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, like all other diatomic homonuclear molecules, is infrared inactive on account of the inversion symmetry and does thus not possess a "dipole allowed" rotovibrational spectrum at any frequency).

== Collision-induced spectra ==

Molecular fly-by collisions take little time, something like 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; s. 
Optical transition of collisional complexes of molecules generate spectral 
"lines" that are very broad - roughly five orders of magnitude broader 
than the most familiar "ordinary" spectral lines (Heisenberg's uncertainty 
relation).&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; The resulting spectral "lines" usually strongly 
overlap so that collision-induced spectral bands typically appear as continua 
(as opposed to the bands of often discernible lines of ordinary molecules).

Collision-induced spectra appear at the frequencies of the rotovibrational and 
electronic transition bands of the unperturbed molecules, and also at sums and 
differences of such transition frequencies: simultaneous transitions in two (or 
more) interacting molecules are well known to generate optical transitions of
molecular complexes.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

== Virial expansions of spectral intensities ==

{{main|Virial equation}}

Intensities of spectra of individual atoms or molecules typically vary linearly 
with the numerical gas density. However, if gas densities are sufficiently 
increased, quite generally contributions may also be observed that vary as density
squared, cubed... These are the collision-induced spectra of two-body (and 
quite possibly three-body,...) collisional complexes. The collision-induced spectra
have sometimes been separated from the continua of individual atoms and 
molecules, based on the characteristic density dependences. In other words, a 
virial expansion in terms of powers of the numerical gas density is often 
observable, just as this is widely known for the virial expansion of the equation 
of state of compressed gases. The first term of the expansion, which is linear 
in density, represents the ideal gas (or "ordinary'') spectra where these 
exist. (This first term vanishes for the infrared inactive gases,) And
the quadratic, cubic,... terms of the virial expansions arise from optical 
transitions of binary, ternary,... intermolecular complexes, which are 
(often unjustifyably) neglected in the ideal gas approximation of spectroscopy.

== Spectra of van der Waals molecules ==

Two kinds of complexes of molecules exist: the collisional complexes discussed 
above, which are short lived. Besides, bound (i.e. relatively stable) complexes
of two or more molecules exist, the so-called van der Waals molecules. These 
exist usually for much longer times than the collisional complexes and, under 
carefully chosen experimental conditions (low temperature, moderate gas density), 
their rotovibrational band spectra show "sharp" (or resolvable) lines (Heisenberg
uncertainty principle), much like ordinary molecules. If the parent molecules 
are nonpolar, the same induced dipole mechanisms, which are discussed above, 
are responsible for the observable spectra of van der Waals molecules.

Figure 1 (to be included)

== An example of CIA spectra ==

Figure 1 shows an example of a collision-induced absorption spectra 
of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-He complexes at a variety of temperatures. The spectra were computed
from the fundamental theory, using quantum chemical methods, and were shown to
be in close agreement with laboratory measurements at temperatures, where such 
measurements exist (for temperatures around 300 K and lower).&lt;ref name="ref8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Abel|author2= L. Frommhold|author3= X. Li|author4=K. L. C. Hunt|title=Computation of collision-induced absorption by dense deuterium-helium gas mixtures.|work=J. Chem. Phys.|volume=134|pages=076101:1&amp;ndash;076101:2|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The intensity scale of the figure is highly compressed. At the 
lowest temperature (300 K), a series of six striking maxima is seen, with deep minima
between them. The broad maxima roughly coincide with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vibrational bands.
With increasing temperature, the minima become less striking and disappear at
the highest temperature (curve at the top, for the temperature of 9000 K).

A similar picture is to be expected for the CIA spectra of pure hydrogen gas 
(i.e. without admixed gases) and, in fact for the CIA spectra of many
other gases. The main difference, say if nitrogen CIA spectra are considered 
instead of those of hydrogen gas, would be a much closer spacing, if not a total 
overlapping, of the diverse CIA bands which appear roughly at the frequencies
of the vibrational bands of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.

== Significance ==

The significance of CIA for [[astrophysics]] was recognized early-on, especially where dense atmospheres of mixtures of molecular hydrogen and helium gas exist.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

=== Cool white dwarf stars ===

Stars that burn hydrogen are called [[main sequence star|main sequence (MS) stars]] - these are by far the most common objects in the night sky. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted and temperatures begin to fall, the object undergoes various transformations
and a [[white dwarf]] star is eventually born, the ember of the expired MS star. Temperatures of a new-born white dwarf may be in the hundreds of thousand kelvin, but if the mass of the white dwarf is less than just a few [[solar mass]]es, burning of 4He to 12C and 16O is not possible and the star will slowly cool down forever. The coolest white dwarfs observed have temperatures of roughly 4000 K, which must mean that the universe is not old enough so that lower temperature stars cannot be found. The emission spectra of "cool" white dwarfs does not at all look like a [[Planck's law|Planck blackbody spectrum]].&lt;ref name="ref16"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. T. Hodgkin|author2= B. R.

=== Other cool stars ===

The atmospheres of low metallicity cool stars are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.  Collision-induced absorption by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-He transient complexes will be a more or less important opacity source of their atmospheres. For example, CIA in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fundamental band, which falls on top of an opacity window between

=== First stars ===

Attempts to model the formation of the "first" star from the pure hydrogen and helium gas clouds below about 10,000 K show that the heat generated in the gravitational contraction phase must be somehow radiatively released for further cooling to be possible.  This is no problem as long as temperatures are  still high enough so that free electrons exist: electrons are efficient emitters when interacting with neutrals (bremsstrahlung). However, at the lower temperatures in neutral gases, the recombination of hydrogen atoms to 
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules is a process that generates enormous amounts of heat that must somehow be radiated away in CIE processes; if CIE were non-existing, molecule formation could not take place and temperatures could not fall further.  Only CIE processes permit further cooling, so that molecular hydrogen will accumulate. A dense, cool environment will thus develop so that a [[gravitational collapse]] and star formation can actually proceed.&lt;ref name="ref26"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. Lenzuni|author2= D. F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37754">'''Communicative ecology''' is a conceptual model used in the field of media and communications research. 

The model is used to analyse and represent the relationships between [[social interaction]]s, [[discourse]], and communication [[Media (communication)|media]] and technology of individuals, collectives and networks in physical and digital environments. Broadly, the term communicative ecology refers to "the context in which [[communication]] processes occur" [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007, p. 9)]]. These processes are seen to involve people communicating with others in their [[social network]]s, both face-to-face and using a mix of media and communication technologies [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi, Slater &amp; Hearn, 2003)]] [[#Tacchi2007|(Tacchi, et al. 2007)]]. 

== Rationale ==
The communicative ecology model enables researchers to take a holistic approach to understanding the dynamic interrelationships between social dimensions, discourse and communications technology in both physical and digital environments. The use of an ecological metaphor markedly expands the potential sphere of inquiry for communications and media research. It shifts the focus away from studies focusing on single communications devices or applications, for example the mobile telephone or email, towards whole system interactions. Consequently, it extends the possibility of research into population change and lifecycles, spatiotemporal dynamics, networks and clusters, and power relations within the frame of a communicative ecology. Also, as ecologies are not isolated entities, further questions regarding the similarities, differences, interrelationships and transactions between ecologies can be examined. A richer understanding can then be derived from micro and macro level analysis of the social and cultural context of communication [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

The concept of communicative ecology has emerged amidst concerns that studies attempting to identify causal relationships between discrete technologies and social impacts neglect variables that are salient to the successful implementation and uptake of technologies ''in situ'' [[#Dourish2004|(Dourish, 2004)]]. This mirrors the way in which the biological field of [[ecology]] emerged from the perceived inadequacies of studies of single species of flora and fauna. In a similar way, researchers who use the communicative ecology framework argue that media technologies should not be examined independent of their context of use. They assert that [[new media]] must be both studied and designed with reference to the users' wider set of social relationships, the nature of the communication itself and other media in use. Through use of [[ethnography|ethnographic approaches]] a richer, more nuanced understanding of the communicative system of a given setting is able to be developed.

New media are usually introduced into existing communication structures and must compete for attention in relation to the users' existing portfolio of communication tools. Consequently, if a new communication technology does not complement or enhance the existing toolset it risks rejection. The communicative ecology model allows researchers to examine how a new form of media or technology may or may not be integrated into existing communication patterns [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]].

However, the potential utility of the communicative ecology model is far broader than this. Any new form of social intervention, content or technology must be locally appropriate for it to succeed [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]]. Hence, the communicative ecology framework is useful for [[human-computer interaction]] designers, content creators, and in [[urban informatics]], [[urban planning]], [[community development]] and [[education]] when seeking opportunities to enhance or augment local, social, and communication practices.

==History and usage==
The concept of communicative ecology is derived from Altheide's "ecology of communication" [[#Altheide1994|(1994;]][[#Altheide1995|1995)]]. Altheide developed this concept to examine the mutually influential relationships between information technology, communication formats and social activities, within the context of people's social and physical environments, as they define and experience them. The concept is influenced by [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan's]] [[#McLuhan1962|(1962)]] research on [[media ecology]], which demonstrates that new media and technology can influence communicative content, and also the [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] perspective of communication as embedded in context [[#Barnlund1979|(Barnlund, 1979]]). Altheide considers ecology of communication to be a fluid construct that can be used as a frame to investigate the ways in which social activities are being created and modified through the use of technologies that, in turn, give rise to new communication formats. He is particularly interested in the relationship between social activities and technologies for surveillance and control.

The communicative ecology concept has been further developed for use in studies of information and communication technologies (ICT) initiatives in developing nations [[#Slater2002|(Slater, Tacchi &amp; Lewis, 2002)]]. A guide to the study of communicative ecologies using the ethnographic action research method, developed with the support of UNESCO, has spawned a proliferation of empirical research [[#Tacchi2007|(Tacchi et al., 2007)]] [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi, Slater &amp; Hearn, 2003)]]. Many of these investigations have focused on ICT for development projects associated with community technology centres and local information networks in South Asian and African nations [[#Slater2002|(Slater et al., 2002;]][[#Slater2004|Slater &amp; Tacchi, 2004;]][[#Pringle2004|Pringle, Bajracharya, &amp; Bajracharya, 2004;]][[#Sharma2005|Sharma, 2005;]][[#Nair2006|Nair, Jennaway &amp; Skuse, 2006;]][[#Rangaswamy2007|Rangaswamy, 2007)]]. In these studies, local community members are often engaged as active participants in a research and project development process that provides opportunities for them to gain the ICT literacy skills necessary to create locally meaningful content [[#Subramanian2004|(Subramanian, Nair &amp; Sharma, 2004;]][[#Tacchi2005a|Tacchi, 2005a]], [[#Tacchi2007|2007;]][[#TacchiWatkins2007|Tacchi &amp; Watkins, 2007)]]. Many of these research activities investigate and support interventions that aim to alleviate poverty [[#Slater2005|(Slater &amp; Kwami, 2005)]], educate [[#Subramanian2005|(Subramanian, 2005)]] and promote the [[digital inclusion]] necessary for citizens to actively participate in civic life and have their voices heard [[#Tacchi2005b|(Tacchi, 2005b;]][[#Skuse2007|Skuse &amp; Cousins, 2007]], [[#Skuse2008|2008;]][[#SkuseFildes2007|Skuse, Fildes, Tacchi, Martin &amp; Baulch, 2007;]]. Some studies have reported on the use of a particular ICT, for example [[community radio]] [[#Tacchi2005c|(Tacchi, 2005c)]] or [[mobile phone]]s [[#Horst2006|(Horst &amp; Miller, 2006;]][[#Miller2007|Miller, 2007)]], in relation to broader communication patterns.

More recently, the communicative ecology framework has been extended in studies of the nature of media use to support social networks in [[urban village]]s and inner-city apartment buildings [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. This paper introduced the concept of dimensions to the communicative ecology model. [[#Button2007|Button and Partridge (2007)]] used the model to examine the online communicative ecology of neighbourhood websites. The model has also been used to investigate how students communicate and reflect on their learning [[#Berry2006|(Berry &amp; Hamilton, 2006)]].

A special issue of the Electronic Journal of Communication showcased the versatility of the communicative ecology approach [[#HearnFoth2007|(Hearn &amp; Foth, 2007)]]. In this issue, [[#Allison2007|Allison (2007)]] looked at the communicative ecology from the perspective of the individual, whereas [[#Wilkin2007|Wilkin, Ball-Rokeach, Matsaganis and Cheong (2007)]] used a panoptic perspective to compare the ecologies of geo-ethnic communities. [[#Peeples2007|Peeples and Mitchell (2007)]] used the model to explore the social activity of protest. [[#Powell2007|Powell (2007)]] focused on a particular medium, public internet access, in an urban context. [[#Shepherd2007|Shepherd, Arnold, Bellamy and Gibbs (2007)]] extended the concept to attend to the material and spatial aspects of the communicative ecology of the domestic sphere.

The term "communicative ecology" has also been used in other studies with various interpretations. [[interactional sociolinguistics|Interactional sociolinguists]] use the term to describe the local communicative environment of a particular setting in which discourse is contextualised. Using methods drawn from [[linguistic anthropology]], their research begins with a period of ethnography in which a rich understanding of the local communicative ecology is formed. Discourse is then analysed in relation to this ecological context [[#Gumperz1999|(Gumperz, 1999)]]. [[#Roberts2005|Roberts (2005)]] describes a communicative ecology as comprising the identity of participants, the topics of communication and the ways in which things are communicated, including tone of voice, directness, etc. [[#Beier2001|Beier (2001)]] draws on [[Dell Hymes|Hymes']] [[#Hymes1974|(1974)]] work in [[ethnography of communication]] and uses the concept to understand the range of communicative practices of the Nanti people as a system of interaction.

From an [[applied linguistics]] perspective, [[#McArthur2005|McArthur (2005)]] describes a communicative ecology as embracing the nature and evolution of language, media and communication technologies. He uses the term to discuss the interactions between the world's languages and communication technologies. [[#Wagner2004|Wagner (2004)]] uses the term to refer to the deep structures of meaning and communicative action that human language shares with other species, particularly the [[bonobo]]. In cultural studies of terrorism, [[#White2003|White (2003)]] uses the term to describe the interchange of signs within interacting networks of individuals and collectives.

In their study of [[computer-mediated communication]] in the workplace, [[#Yates2003|Yates, Orlikowski and Woerner (2003)]] draw upon [[#Erickson2000|Erickson's (2000)]] work on genre ecologies to suggest a communicative ecology can be identified by the types and frequencies of communicative practices, such as email threading activities. Their version of communicative ecology is influenced by members of a workplace engaging in common activities, the length of time over which interaction takes place, whether communication media is synchronous or asynchronous and members' linguistic or cultural background.

There is not a single, agreed upon communicative ecology model, rather, this section highlights that there are various approaches to understanding and applying the model in various contexts. Furthermore, concepts that bear some similarity to communicative ecology include [[actor-network theory]] [[#Latour2005|(Latour, 2005)]], [[Scandinavian activity theory|activity theory]] [[#Nardi1996|(Nardi, 1996)]] the communication infrastructure model [[#Ball-Rokeach2001|(Ball-Rokeach, Kim &amp; Matei, 2001)]] and the personal communication system [[#Boase2008|(Boase, 2008)]].

==Characteristics==
Often in sociological literature, an ecology is seen to be anchored in a geographical area of human settlement. In the case of a communicative ecology, while the majority of studies have been conducted in physical environments, it is also possible to use the framework to examine ecologies grounded in an online environment. In many cases, communicative ecologies move seamlessly across both kinds of settings. For example, settings may include both public and private spaces, transport infrastructure and websites, in any combination.

Different settings have distinct affordances that may facilitate or hinder communication within an ecology. In a physical setting this might mean a neighbourhood has several coffee shops and parks where residents can interact. In an online setting, certain design features may enable certain types of communication and constrain others. For example, discussion boards facilitate one-to-many or many-to-many collective forms of communication but not one-to-one or peer-to-peer style networked communication that would be better served by [[short message service|SMS]] or [[Instant messaging &amp; messengers|instant messaging]] [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

Similar to biological ecologies, communicative ecologies have lifecycles. They can be described as new or well-established, active or dormant, or in a period of growth or decline. For example, residents of a new master-planned housing estate will have a young communicative ecology that is in a period of growth but may need cultivation in order to become active. In this case, sociocultural animation of the ecology may be required for it to become socially sustainable [[#Tacchi2003|(Tacchi et al., 2003)]].

Communicative ecologies can be conceived as having three layers and differing across several spectral dimensions. The nature of a communicative ecology changes as its members engage in and transition between different types of activities.

===Layers===
A communicative ecology has three layers: social, discursive and technological [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. These layers are seen to be intricately entwined and mutually constitutive, rather than discrete, hierarchical or as having unidirectional causal relationships. While it is challenging to consider each layer in isolation, analysing each layer independently can be a beneficial preliminary step prior to the examination of the complex, mutual shaping relationships that form part of the holistic view of a communicative ecology.

The social layer refers to people and the various social structures with which they identify themselves, ranging from informal personal networks to formal institutions. For example, this may include groups of friends, formal community organisations and companies. The discursive layer refers to the themes or content of both mediated and unmediated communication. The technological layer comprises communication media and technologies. This includes both traditional media, such as newspapers and television, and new media including mobile phones and social networking sites. The devices and applications within this layer are differentiated according to the communication model they facilitate. For example, collective communication is made possible through one-to-many or many-to-many forms of media, such as television or online discussion boards, whereas networked communication can be enabled through one-to-one or peer-to-peer media, including instant messaging or SMS [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]].

The layered nature of the communicative ecology framework enables the investigation of research questions surrounding the media preferences of diverse individuals and groups and how these choices influence their relationships. It also allows researchers to explore the nature of discourse between individuals and within groups, and how communication changes according to the nature of people's relationships with one another. The communicative ecology model is also useful for considering how different topics of communication affect choice of media and how different media shape communicative content.

===Dimensions===
Communicative ecologies vary across several spectral dimensions. The dimensions identified to date, include networked/collective, global/local and online/offline [[#FothHearn2007|(Foth &amp; Hearn, 2007)]]. The dimensional properties of communicative ecologies allow researchers to consider both the relative strength of each characteristic, and also how individuals and the ecology itself transitions fluidly between dimensions.

For example, researchers can question how an individual or group's choice of media changes as they transition between networked and collective forms of interaction. They may also consider how different media may facilitate or constrain either networked or collective interaction. If interested in the global or local characteristics of an ecology, researchers may examine how communication with proximate others may be mediated differently from communication with others in distant locales. They could also explore which communication topics are more likely to occur at the local level rather than within globally distributed social networks. As users of new technologies now move seamlessly between what was formerly constituted as online and offline domains, researchers may use the communicative ecology model to address questions of how and why people choose certain assemblages of online and offline media to achieve particular communicative goals. Investigation of how the nature of discourse may affect the choice of online or offline modes of interaction is also possible.

Communicative ecologies can also be characterised across several other dimensions. One example is the private/public dimension. People may choose to interact and communicate with each other in private settings, such as their home or via email, or in more public settings, such as a restaurant or chat room.

===Types of activity===
The nature of an individual's communicative ecology changes as they transition between types of activity. For example, they may choose to use different media when communicating with colleagues as compared to planning an evening out with friends. Similarly, a workplace's communicative ecology may differ from that of a tennis club or a loosely joined network of environmental activists.

The activities of everyday life can be grouped into various types. Five example categories are as follows. The first three are derived from [[#Stebbins2007|Stebbins's (2007)]] typology of leisure activities.

# Casual leisure (e.g. dinner with friends, seeing a movie)
# Serious leisure (e.g. volunteering, amateur car racing)
# Project-based leisure (e.g. short hobby-based education courses, one-off participation in a fun run)
# Domestic/personal work (e.g. housework, grocery shopping, personal grooming)
# Work/formal education (e.g. job, school attendance)

These groupings enable exploration of the patterns of social interactions, topics of communication and media applications that may be specific to an activity type.

==Scope, resolution and granularity==
The study of a communicative ecology requires decisions to be made concerning the scope of both data collection and analysis. Prior to data collection, a decision must be made as to the investigative frame of the study, whereas decisions regarding the analytical scope of a study may be made after a rich picture of the ecology has emerged.

While an ecological study aims to be holistic, an appropriate frame for the study must be decided upon at the outset. The scope of communicative ecology research settings is generally restricted to a bounded geographical space. It has been proposed that the communicative ecology framework is suited to studies at the level of the dwelling, neighbourhood, suburb or city [[#HearnFoth2007|(Hearn &amp; Foth, 2007)]]. However, it is also suitable for studies of communicative ecologies that are grounded in online environments. In this case, the setting could be limited to one or several websites [[#Button2007|(Button &amp; Partridge, 2007)]].

Temporal considerations may also shape data collection procedures. For example, an ecology could be examined at a single point of time or longitudinally. It is possible that the nature of a communicative ecology may also vary according to time of day, week or season.

The analysis of a communicative ecology can occur at both macro and micro levels within this spatiotemporal frame. It can help to think of a communicative ecology as a map and its edges as the frame. We can increase the resolution of certain features by using a magnifying glass. By stepping away from the map, we can increase the granularity of our view and see how features interrelate with the ecology as a whole. In this way, the interrelationships between agents are not ignored, as they may be in studies that focus on single communication devices or applications, but may be temporarily set aside while other features are examined more closely. By viewing the map as a whole first, the researcher may be able to make better analytical choices than was possible prior to data collection.

Some possible methods for delimiting the analytical scope of a communicative ecology study include using features of a layer or another characteristic. For example, the analysis could be delimited to examining the ecology of an individual, a small social network or group, or by certain demographic characteristics. It could focus on the ecology of a specific theme of communication, form of media or technology, setting or activity. Alternatively, it could investigate a single dimension of a communicative ecology, for example, only local or public forms of communication.

==Perspective==
Communicative ecology researchers speak in terms of "mapping" the ecology. This term may be misleading as it could appear to indicate the creation of cartographic renderings of the communicative ecology as it relates to its locality. Mapping the ecology, in the main, refers to drawing conceptual maps and creating or collecting oral or written descriptions of the phenomena that constitute the communicative ecology.

There are two primary perspectives taken to communicative ecology research that are loosely correlative with the [[emic and etic]] positions taken in classic ethnographic studies. A researcher can work from the outside of the ecology looking in with the aim of creating a holistic overview. Alternatively, they can position themselves within the communicative ecology with the aim of looking at it from the participants' points of view. The external view is useful if a comparison between local systems is desired. A centric view is better suited to understanding how people construct and make sense of their communicative ecology.

The choice of perspective may enhance or limit the utility of the data. For example, a birds-eye view may fail to capture significant individual differences in the experience of a communicative ecology, such as those brought about by differing wealth or literacy levels. Ideally, communicative ecology research should use a variety of perspectives in order to obtain a more complete representation and deeper understanding.

==Associated research approaches and methods==
The study of communicative ecologies is commonly associated with a research approach known as ethnographic action research. This approach combines ethnographic methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews, with participatory methods and action research. The ethnographic methods enable researchers to develop a rich understanding of the meanings derived from media and communication technologies. The action research methods allow the study to be located in not only communication theory, but also grassroots communication practice. In this approach, participants can act as co-investigators in cycles of inquiry, action and reflection and researchers are able to give back in a way that will develop the communicative ecology. In this way, ethnographic action research is suited to both research and project development agendas [[#Tacchi2006|(Tacchi, 2006)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6407">[[File:Fingernail Clippers.jpg|thumb|[[Nail clippers]] are a simple form of compound lever]]The compound [[lever]] is a [[simple machine]] operating on the premise that the resistance from one lever in a system of levers will act as power for the next, and thus the applied force will be amplified from one lever to the next (as long as the mechanical advantage for each lever is greater than one). Almost all [[Weighing scale|scale]]s use some sort of compound lever to work. Other examples include [[nail clippers]] and [[piano]] keys.

==Mechanical advantage==

A [[lever]] arm uses the [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] to lift the load using and intensifying an applied [[force]]. In practice, conditions may prevent the use of a single lever to accomplish the desired result,&lt;ref&gt;Popular Mechanics magazine, April, 1924, p. 615-617&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., a restricted space, the inconvenient location of the point of delivery of the resultant force, or the prohibitive length of the lever arm needed.  In these conditions, combinations of simple levers, called compound levers, are used. Compound levers can be constructed from first, second and/or third-order levers. In all types of compound lever, the rule is that force multiplied by the force arm equals the weight multiplied by the weight arm.  The output from one lever becomes the input for the next lever in the system, and so t

The figure on the left illustrates a compound lever formed from two first-class levers, along with a short derivation of how to compute the mechanical advantage.  With the dimensions shown, the mechanical advantage, W/F can be calculated as {{sfrac|9 &amp;times; 10|3 &amp;times; 4}} = 7.5, meaning that an applied force of 1 pound (or 1&amp;nbsp;kg) could lift a weight of 7.5&amp;nbsp;lb (or 7.5&amp;nbsp;kg).

Alternatively, if the position of the fulcrum on lever AA' were moved so that A1 = 4 units and A2 = 9 units, then the mechanical advantage W/F is calculated as {{sfrac|4 &amp;times; 9|9 &amp;times; 4}} = 1, meaning that an applied force will lift an equivalent weight and there is no mechanical advantage.  This is not usually the goal of a compound lever system, though in rare situations the geometry may suit a specific purpose.

[[File:Coupe ongle annotated.svg|thumb|right|Calculation of the mechanical advantage of a nail clipper]]

The distances used in calculation of mechanical advantage are measured perpendicular to the force. In the example of a [[nail clipper]] on the right (a compound lever made of a class 2 and a class 3 lever), because the effort is applied vertically (that is, not [[perpendicular]] to the lever), distances to the respective fulcrums are measured horizontally, instead of along the lever. In this example, W/F is {{sfrac|(7 + 1) &amp;times; 6|1 &amp;times; (6 + 2)}} = 6. Note that (7 + 1) cm = 8&amp;nbsp;cm is the distance from the point of application of the effort to the fulcrum of the first lever, perpendicular to the applied effort.

==Examples==
[[File:Hornady Reloading Press.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A [[handloading]] press uses a compound lever to reduce the force the operator must apply and confine the action to a relatively small space.]]A few examples of the compound lever are the scale, [[railway brake|train brakes]], and a common type of [[nail clippers]]. Another example is the elbow-joint press, which is used in printing, molding or [[handloading]] bullets, minting coins and medals, and in hole punching. Compound balances are used to weigh heavy items. These all use multiple levers to magnify force to accomplish a specific purpose. The train brake translates the force of pushing back the stick to the levers and they rub against the wheels, using friction to slow and eventually stop the train. These are everyday applications of this mechanism.

[[File:Broadwood grand square action.svg|thumb|left|A compound lever translates the small movement of a [[piano]] key to the fast, hard strike of the hammer on the strings]]A piano key is a compound lever of the first-class, since the fulcrum is between the weight to be moved and the power.  The purpose of this lever is to translate a small movement (depression of the key) into a larger and fast movement of the hammer on the strings.  The quality of the resulting tone depends on whether the final speed is brought about by gradual or sudden movement of the key.&lt;ref&gt;Presser T, Cooke JF. The etude. T. Presser, 1916, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by [[Archimedes]]. "''Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth with a lever''" is a remark attributed to Archimedes, who formally stated the correct mathematical principle of levers (quoted by Pappus of Alexandria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Alan Lindsay|title=A Dictionary of scientific quotations|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|year=1991|page=11|chapter=Archimedes ca 287–212 BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the compound lever is attributed to the [[Birmingham]] inventor [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]] in 1743,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceccarelli|first=Marco|title=Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science: Their Contributions and Legacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmBnVMA5ri4C|accessdate=2010-01-17|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1-4020-6365-2|page=16|quote=Then in 1743 John Wyatt (1700–1766) introduced the idea of the compound lever, in which two or more levers work together to further reduce effort.}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he designed a [[Weighing scale|weighing machine]] that used four compound levers to transfer a load from a weighing platform to a central lever from which the weight could be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.4 |title=The History of Weighing |accessdate=2010-01-17 |publisher=Avery Weigh-Tronix |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302145347/http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.4 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compression artifact''' (or '''artefact''') is a noticeable distortion of media (including [[image]]s, [[Sound recording|audio]], and [[video]]) caused by the application of [[lossy compression]].

Lossy data compression involves discarding some of the media's data so that it becomes simplified enough to be stored within the desired [[File size|disk space]] or be transmitted (or streamed) within the bandwidth limitations (known as a data rate or [[bit rate]] for media that is streamed). If the compressor could not reproduce enough data in the compressed version to reproduce the original, the result is a diminishing of quality, or introduction of artifacts. Alternatively, the compression [[algorithm]] may not be intelligent enough to discriminate between distortions of little subjective importance and those objectionable to the viewer.

Compression artifacts occur in many common media such as [[DVD]]s, common computer file formats such as [[JPEG]], [[MP3]], or [[MPEG]] files, and some alternatives to the compact disc, such as [[Sony|Sony's]] [[MiniDisc]] format. Uncompressed media (such as on [[Laserdisc]]s, [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Audio CDs]], and [[WAV]] files) or [[lossless data compression|losslessly compressed]] media (such as [[FLAC]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]) do not suffer from compression artifacts.

The minimization of perceivable artifacts is a key goal in implementing a lossy compression algorithm. However, artifacts are occasionally ''intentionally'' produced for artistic purposes, a style known as [[glitch art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geere |first=Duncan |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/17/glitch-art-databending |title=Glitch art created by 'databending' |publisher=Wired |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or datamoshing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker-Smith |first=Ben |url=http://bitsynthesis.com/2009/04/tutorial-datamoshing-the-beauty-of-glitch/ |title=Datamoshing&amp;nbsp;– The Beauty of Glitch |publisher=Bitsynthesis.com |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically speaking, a compression artifact is a particular class of data error that is usually the consequence of [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] in lossy data compression. Where [[transform coding]] is used, they typically assume the form of one of the [[basis function]]s of the coder's transform space.

When performing block-based coding for [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], as in JPEG-compressed images, several types of artefacts can appear.
* [[Ringing artifacts#JPEG|Ringing]]
* Contouring
* [[Posterizing]]
* Staircase noise ([[aliasing]]) along curving edges
* Blockiness in "busy" regions (block boundary artefacts, sometimes called macroblocking, quilting, or checkerboarding)

Other lossy algorithms, which use pattern matching to deduplicate similar symbols, are prone to introducing hard to detect errors in printed text. For example, the numbers "6" and "8" may get replaced. This has been observed to happen with [[JBIG2]] in certain photocopier machines.&lt;ref name="kriesel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning|title=Xerox scanners/photocopiers randomly alter numbers in scanned documents|date=2013-08-02|accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23588202 |title=Confused Xerox copiers rewrite documents, expert finds |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Block boundary artefacts ===
[[File:The macroblocking effect (JPEG).png|344px|right|thumb|Block coding artefacts in a JPEG image. Flat blocks are caused by coarse quantization. Discontinuities at transform block boundaries are visible.]]
At low bit rates, any [[lossy]] block-based coding scheme introduces visible artefacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries. These boundaries can transform block boundaries, prediction block boundaries, or both, and may coincide with [[macroblock]] boundaries. The term ''macroblocking'' is commonly used regardless of the artefact's cause. Other names include tiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STFAx4jqU5IC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=tiling+mpeg&amp;source=web&amp;ots=orZJnUBtk5&amp;sig=IxPYZSsRy48ZxKbjYWe2LOUx3FE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result|title=The MPEG handbook by John Watkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; mosaicing, pixelating, quilting, and checkerboarding.

Block-artefacts are a result of the very principle of [[Transform coding#Digital|block transform]] coding. The transform (for example the discrete cosine transform) is applied to a block of pixels, and to achieve lossy compression, the transform coefficients of each block are [[Quantization (image processing)|quantized]]. The lower the bit rate, the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero. Statistically, images have more low-[[Spatial frequency|frequency]] than high-frequency content, so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization, which results in blurry, low-resolution blocks. In the most extreme case only the DC-coefficient, that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block, is retained, and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction.

Because this quantization process is applied individually in each block, neighboring blocks quantize coefficients differently. This leads to discontinuities at the block boundaries. These are most visible in flat areas, where there is little detail to mask the effect.

=== Image artifact reduction ===
{{Main article|Deblocking filter}}
Various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects, but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression (for instance, lower transmission and storage costs), many of these methods focus on "post-processing"—that is, processing images when received or viewed. No post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases; consequently, none has garnered widespread acceptance, though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems. Many photo editing programs, for instance, have proprietary JPEG artefact reduction algorithms built-in. Consumer equipment often calls this post-processing "MPEG Noise Reduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=blocking+artefacts&amp;i=56319,00.asp|title=PC Magazine, Definition of blocking artefacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video ==
[[File:Macroblocking error.png|thumb|350px|Example of image with artifacts due to a transmission error]]
When motion prediction is used, as in [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]] or [[MPEG-4]], compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames, and move with the [[optic flow]] of the image, leading to a peculiar effect, part way between a painting effect and "grime" that moves with objects in the scene.

Data errors in the compressed bit-stream, possibly due to transmission errors, can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors, or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time, leading to "break-up" of the picture.  Where gross errors have occurred in the bit-stream, decoders continue to apply updates to the damaged picture for a short interval, creating a "ghost image" effect, until receiving the next independently compressed frame. In MPEG picture coding, these are known as "[[I-frame]]s", with the 'I' standing for "intra". Until the next I-frame arrives, the decoder can perform [[error concealment]].

=== Motion compensation block boundary artifacts ===
Block boundary discontinuities can occur at edges of [[motion compensation]] prediction blocks. In motion compensated video compression, the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks (macroblocks, partitions, or prediction units) of pixels from previously decoded frames. If two neighboring blocks use different motion vectors, there will be a discontinuity at the edge between the blocks.

=== Mosquito noise ===
Video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images, for instance [[Ringing artifacts#JPEG|ringing]] or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges, called '''mosquito noise''', as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object.&lt;ref name="dinhpatry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Le Dinh|first1=Phuc-Tue|last2=Patry|first2=Jacques|title=Video compression artifacts and MPEG noise reduction|url=http://www.embedded.com/print/4013028|website=Embedded|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'''3.9 mosquito noise:''' Form of edge busyness distortion sometimes associated with movement, characterized by moving artifacts and/or blotchy noise patterns superimposed over the objects (resembling a mosquito flying around a person's head and shoulders)."

=== Video artifact reduction ===
{{Main article|Deblocking filter}}
The artifacts at block boundaries can be reduced by applying a [[deblocking filter]]. As in still image coding, it is possible to apply a deblocking filter to the decoder output as post-processing.

In motion-predicted video coding with a closed prediction loop, the encoder uses the decoder output as the prediction reference from which future frames are predicted. To that end, the encoder conceptually integrates a decoder. If this "decoder" performs a deblocking, the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation, which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames. This is referred to as an in-loop deblocking filter. Standards which specify an in-loop deblocking filter include [[VC-1]], [[H.263]] Annex J, [[H.264/AVC]], and [[H.265/HEVC]].

== Audio ==
Lossy audio compression typically works with a psychoacoustic model—a model of human hearing perception. Lossy audio formats typically involve the use of a time/frequency domain transform, such as a [[modified discrete cosine transform]]. With the psychoacoustic model, masking effects such as frequency masking and temporal masking are exploited, so that sounds that should be imperceptible are not recorded. For example, in general, human beings are unable to perceive a quiet tone played simultaneously with a similar but louder tone. A lossy compression technique might identify this quiet tone and attempt to remove it. Also, quantization noise can be "hidden" where they would be masked by more prominent sounds. With low compression, a conservative psy-model is used with small block sizes.

When the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate, when the transform block size is restrained, or when aggressive compression is used, this may result in compression artifacts. Compression artifacts in compressed audio typically show up as ringing, [[pre-echo]], "birdie artifacts", drop-outs, rattling, warbling, metallic ringing, an underwater feeling, hissing, or "graininess".

A good way to observe compression artifacts in audio is to listen to the applause in a relatively highly compressed audio file (e.g. 96 kbit/sec MP3). In general, musical tones have repeating waveforms and more predictable variations in volume, whereas applause is essentially random, therefore hard to compress. A highly compressed track of applause will illustrate the "metallic ringing" and other compression artifacts very well.

== Artistic use ==
[[File:Glitch video.ogg|thumb|right|250px|Video glitch art]]
Compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style, sometimes known as ''[[glitch art]]''.

In still images, an example is ''Jpegs'' by German photographer [[Thomas Ruff]], which uses intentional [[JPEG]] artifacts as the basis of the picture's style.&lt;ref&gt;''jpegs'', [[Thomas Ruff]], ''Aperture'', May 31, 2009, 132 pp., {{ISBN|978-1-59711-093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/2009/04/review_jpegs_by_thomas_ruff/ Review: jpegs by Thomas Ruff], by [[Jörg Colberg]], April 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[video art]], one technique is ''datamoshing'', where two videos are interleaved so intermediate frames are interpolated from two separate sources. Another technique involves simply transcoding from one lossy video format to another, which exploits the difference in how the separate video codecs process motion and color information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anoniem zei |url=http://rosa-menkman.blogspot.com/2009/02/from-compression-artifact-to-filter.html |title=From compression artifact to filter |publisher=Rosa-menkman.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was pioneered by artists [[Bertrand Planes]] in collaboration with [[Christian Jacquemin]] in 2006 with [[DivXPrime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jacquemin |first=Christian | title =Le bug dans l'oeuvre DivXPrime de Bertrand Planes: Invention et mutation.

'''Computer-aided production engineering''' (CAPE) is a relatively new and significant branch of engineering. Global manufacturing has changed the environment in which goods are produced.  Meanwhile, the rapid development of electronics and communication technologies has required design and manufacturing to keep pace.{{ref|intro1}}

==Description of CAPE==

CAPE is seen as a new     type of [[Computer-aided design|computer-aided]] engineering environment which will improve the productivity of manufacturing/industrial engineers. This environment would be used by engineers to design and implement future manufacturing systems and subsystems. Work is currently underway at the United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) on CAPE systems. The NIST project is aimed at advancing the development of software environments and tools for the design and engineering of manufacturing systems.{{ref|desc1}}

==CAPE and the Future of Manufacturing==

The future of [[manufacturing]] will be determined by the efficiency with which it can incorporate new [[technologies]]. The current process in engineering manufacturing systems is often [[ad hoc]], with computerized tools being used on a limited basis. Given the costs and resources involved in the construction and operation of manufacturing systems, the engineering process must be made more efficient. New computing environments for engineering manufacturing systems could help achieve that objective.

Why is CAPE important? In much the same way that [[Industrial design|product designers]] need computer-aided design systems, manufacturing and industrial engineers need sophisticated computing capabilities to solve complex problems and manage the vast data associated with the design of a manufacturing system.

In order to solve these complex problems and manage [[Data-driven design|design data]], computerized tools must be used in the application of [[scientific]] and engineering methods to the problem of the
design and implementation of manufacturing systems. [[Engineers]] must address the entire [[factory]] as a system and the interactions of that system with its surrounding environment.
Components of a factory system include:
* the [[physical plant]] housing the manufacturing facility;
* the production facilities which perform the manufacturing operations;
* the technologies used in the production facility;
* the work centers/stations, [[machinery]], equipment, tools, and materials which comprise or are used by the production facilities;
* the various support facilities;
* the relationship between the factory and its environment.

CAPE must not only be concerned with the initial design and engineering of the factory, it must also address enhancements over time. CAPE should support standard engineering methods and problem-solving techniques, [[automation|automate]] mundane tasks, and provide reference data to support the decision-making process.

The environment should be designed to help engineers become more productive and effective in their work. This would be implemented on [[personal computers]] or engineering workstations which have been configured with appropriate peripheral devices. Engineering tool developers will have to integrate the functions and data used by a number of different disciplines, for example:
* manufacturing, industrial and plant engineering;
* materials processing and quality engineering;
* environmental engineering,
* mathematical modeling/simulation, statistical process control and computer science,
* economic and cost analysis and management science,

Many of the methods, formulas, and data associated with these technical areas currently exist only in engineering handbooks. Although some computerized tools are available, they are often very specialized, difficult to use, and do not share information or work together. Engineering tools built by different vendors must be made compatible through [[open systems architecture]]s and interface standards.{{ref|fut1}}

==What CAPE will look like==

CAPE will be based upon computer systems providing an integrated set of design and engineering tools.  These software tools will be used by a company’s manufacturing engineers to continuously improve its production systems. They will maintain information about manufacturing resources, enhance production capabilities, and develop new facilities and systems. Engineers working on different workstations will share information through a common database.

Using CAPE, an engineering team will prepare detailed plans and working models for an entire factory in a matter of days. Alternative solutions to production problems could be quickly developed and evaluated. This would be a significant improvement over current manual methods which may require weeks or months of intensive activity.

To achieve this goal, a new set of engineering tools are needed. Examples of functions which should be supported include:
* identification of product specifications and production requirements;
* producibility analysis for products and modification of product designs to address manufacturability issues and management, scheduling and tracking of projects;
* modeling and specification of manufacturing processes and plant layout and facilities planning;
* consideration of various economic/cost tradeoffs of different manufacturing processes, systems, tools, and materials;
* analysis supporting selection of systems/vendors and procurement of manufacturing equipment and support systems;
* task and work place design;
* compliance with various regulations, specifications, and standards, and control of hazardous materials.

The tools implementing these functions must be highly automated and integrated; and will need to provide quick access to a wide range of data. This data must be maintained in a format that is accessible and usable by the engineering tools. Some examples of the information that might be contained in these electronic libraries include:
* production process models and data and generic manufacturing systems configurations;
* machinery and equipment specifications, and vendor catalogs;
* recommended methods, practices, algorithms, etc., and benchmarking data;
* typical plant/system layouts,
* cost estimation models, labor rates, other cost data and budget templates,
* time standards, industrial standards, project plans, and laws/government regulations.

These on-line libraries would allow engineers to quickly develop solutions based upon the work of others.

Another critical aspect of this engineering environment is affordability, which
can best be achieved by designing an environment that can be constructed from low cost "off-the-shelf" commercial products, rather than custombuilt computer hardware and software. The basic engineering environment must be affordable. For both cost and technical reasons, it must be designed to be able to support incremental upgrades. Incremental upgrades would allow companies to add capabilities as they are needed. Commercial software products must be easy to install and integrate with other software already in use. These capabilities exist to a limited extent in some general purpose commercial software today, e.g., word processors, databases, spreadsheets.{{ref|look}}

==Technical Concerns==

Many technical issues must be considered in the design and development of new engineering tools for CAPE. These issues include:
* required functionality of the tools themselves;
* formalization and refinement of engineering methods;
* development of on-line technical reference libraries, and user engineering and graphics visualization; 
* user engineering and graphics visualization techniques;
* system connectivity and information sharing, and integration standards for the computing environment;
* incorporation of intelligent behavior in the tools.

There are three critical elements to be addressed: creating a common manufacturing systems information model; using an engineering life cycle approach; and developing a software tool integration framework.

Resolution of these elements will help ensure that independently developed systems will be able to work together.  The common information model should identify the elements of the manufacturing system and their relationships to each other; the functions or processes performed by each element; the tools, materials, and information required to perform those functions; and measures of effectiveness for the model and its component elements.

There have been many efforts over the years to develop information models for different
aspects of manufacturing, but no known existing model fully meets the needs of a CAPE ernviroment. Therefore, a [[New product development|life cycle]] approach is needed to identify the different processes that a CAPE environment must support, and must define all phases of a manufacturing system or subsystem’s existence. Some of the major phases which may be included in a system life cycle approach are, requirements identification; system design specification; vendor selection; system development and upgrades; installation, testing, and training; and benchmarking of production operations.

Management, coordination, and administration functions need to be performed during each phase of the life cycle. Phases may be repeated over time as a system is upgraded or re-engineered to meet changing needs or incorporate new technologies.

A software tool integration framework should specify how the tools could be independently designed and developed. The framework would define how CAPE tools would deal with common services, interact with each other and coordinate problem solving activities. Although some existing software products and standards currently address the common services issue, the problem of tool interaction remains largely unsolved. The problem of tool interaction is not limited to the domain of computer-aided manufacturing systems engineering—it is pervasive across the software industry.{{ref|techc}}

==CAPE's current state==

An initial CAPE environment has been established from [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) software packages. This new environment is being used to demonstrate commercially available tools to perform CAPE functions, to develop a better understanding and define functional requirements for individual engineering tools and the overall environment, and to identify the integration issues which must be addressed to implement compatible environments in the future.

Several engineering demonstrations using COTS tools are under development. These demonstrations are designed to illustrate the various types of functions that must be performed in engineering a manufacturing system.

Functions supported by the current COTS environment include: system specification/diagramming,
process [[flowchart]]ing, information [[computer model|modeling]], computer-aided design of products, plant layout, [[material flow analysis]], ergonomic workplace design, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, line balancing, manufacturing simulation, investment analysis, project management, knowledge-based system development, spreadsheets, document preparation, user interface development, document illustration, forms and database management.{{ref|curr}}

==Dally’s  function==
[[File:Glypican.jpg|thumb|Dally acts as a coreceptor for Frizzled, the receptor of the Wnt]]

Dally works as a co-receptor of some secreted signaling molecules as fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and members of the [[Wnt signaling pathway]], TGF-b and Hedgehog families. It is also necessary for the cell division patterning during the post-embryonic development of the nervous system.

It is a regulatory component of the Wg receptor and is part of a multiprotein complex together with [[Frizzled]] (Fz) transmembrane proteins. Therefore, it regulates two cell growth factors in Drosophila melanogaster, Wingless (Wg) and [[Decapentaplegic]] (Dpp). It must be said that in vertebrates the equivalent to Dpp are Bone Morphogenetic Proteins, and the mammalian equal to Wg might be integrin-beta 4. The first one (Wg) controls cell proliferation and differentiation during embryos development, specifically in epidermis, whereas the latter (Dpp) plays a role in the imaginal discs’ growth.

Dpp and Wg are mutually antagonistic in patterning genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emerald B.S |author2=Roy J. K |title=Organising activities of engrailed, hedgehog, wingless and decapentaplegic in the genital discs of Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Development Genes and Evolution|year=1998|volume=208|pages=504–516|doi=10.1007/s004270050209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concretely, dally selectively regulates both Wg signalling in epidermis and Dpp in genitalia. This selectivity is supposed to be controlled by the type of [[Glycosaminoglycan]] GAG bonded to the dally protein, considering that there is a huge structural variety in GAGs.

Tissue malformations occur in various situations. As said in the introduction, the ''sgl'' enzyme is essential for a normal biosynthesis of dally. That is why the absence or malfunction of this enzyme doesn’t allow the correct Wg and Dpp signalling. Also the expression of mutated dally proteins alters Wnt signalling pathways, which leads to anomalies in Drosophila melanogaster’s eye, antennal, genital, wing and neural morphogenesis.

[[File:Location dally.jpg|thumb|Dally's location in chromosome 3]]

==Gene location==
Dally's gene was located in the chromosome 3, concretely in the region 3L 8820605-8884292.&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;[http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0263930.html FlyBase],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutations and its effects==
The mutation of Dally is a consequence of the [[P-element]] and the place where it is located. It is possible to differentiate between the mutants Dally-P1 and Dally-P2, depending on where the insertion of P-element is. It is known that Dally-P2 generates a bigger amount of defects. This mutated Dally disrupts the cell cycle progression, delaying the process during the G2-mitosis transition. As a matter of fact, mutations affecting Dally disrupt patterning of many tissues, for instance of the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Varki A, Cummings R, Esko J, Freeze H, Stanley P, Bertozzi P, Hart G, Etzle M |title=Essentials of Glycobiology, 2nd edition|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87969-770-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dally mutants display cell cycle progression defects in specific sets of dividing cells. Those mutations are pleiotropic and can affect viability and produce morphological defects in several adult tissues, such as the eye, antenna, wing and genitalia.

==Treatment==
Once the mutation has been codified and the protein is functional, there is no chance to turn back and we will speak about a mutated individual. However, if the mutant dally is codified but it is not performing its function yet, a chaperone can identify it and try to correct the mutation, or directly send it to a proteasome using ubiquitins and degrade it.

Notwithstanding, there is another possible solution when malformations have occurred as a result of Wg activity loss. Ectopic dally can potentiate Wg signaling but this effect is dependent on some Wg activity remaining at the cell surface. Moreover, [[ectopic expression]] of dally+ from hs-dally+ transgene, stimulates Wg signaling. Thus, naked larval cuticle &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tsuda M, Kamimura K, Archer M, Fox B, Olson S |title=The cell-surface proteoglican Dally regulates Wingless signaling in Drosophila|journal=Nature|year=1999|volume=400|pages=276–280|pmid=10421371|doi=10.1038/22336|issue=6741}}&lt;/ref&gt;  loss is recuperated and once the larva has become an adult, its tissues execute their normal function. Despite this fact, an intense expression of dally+ results in the death of most of the Drosophila melanogaster’s embryos.

'''Dunkerley's method''' is used in mechanical engineering to determine the critical speed of a shaft-rotor system.  Other methods include the [[Rayleigh&amp;ndash;Ritz method]].

==Whirling of a shaft==

No shaft can ever be perfectly straight or perfectly balanced. When an element of mass is offset from the axis of rotation, centrifugal force will tend to pull the mass outward. The elastic properties of the shaft will act to restore the “straightness”. If the frequency of rotation is equal to one of the resonant frequencies of the shaft, ''whirling'' will occur. In order to save the machine from failure, operation at such whirling speeds must be avoided. Whirling is a complex phenomenon that can include harmonics but we are only going to consider ''synchronous whirl'', where the frequency of whirling is the same as the rotational speed.

==Dunkerley’s formula (approximation)==

The whirling frequency of a symmetric cross section of a given length between two points is given by:
	
:&lt;math&gt;   N  = 94.251 \sqrt{E I \over m L^3} \ \text{RPM}&lt;/math&gt;

where: 
E = Young's modulus,
I = [[second moment of area]],
m = mass of the shaft,
L = length of the shaft between points.

A shaft with weights added will have an angular velocity of N (RPM) equivalent as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N_N^2} = \frac{1}{N_A^2} + \frac{1}{N_B^2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{N_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Mission ==

The mission of Earth Expeditions is to build an alliance of people with direct knowledge of inquiry-driven, community-based learning for the benefit of ecological communities, student achievement, and global understanding.
The image of people who merely transmit and receive knowledge from books is of limited usefulness in an era of rapid social, environmental and technological change. This program envisions each person as an ambassador who creates and transmits knowledge and who promotes authentic dialogue at all levels of society, inspiring others to do the same. With the adoption of participatory models of education, schools become centers of investigation, students engage more deeply in their studies, and communities achieve higher levels of self-determination.

== Project ''Dragonfly'' ==

Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, '''Project ''Dragonfly''''' has reached millions of children, parents and educators through [[science learning]] media, exhibits, and graduate programs. The project began in 1994 with the creation of the award-winning ''Dragonfly'' magazine, the first national magazine to feature the investigations and discoveries of children.  Created in 1994 at [[Miami University]], ''Dragonfly'' magazine was funded by NSF and published by the [[National Science Teachers Association]]. Through mid-2000, the magazine published young investigators alongside such adult researchers as Dr. [[Jane Goodall]].

Project ''Dragonfly'' pioneered the "Real Kids, Real Science" approach to learning and continues to work for inquiry-driven reform to increase public involvement in science and global understanding. In addition to Earth Expeditions, Project ''Dragonfly'' worked with [[Twin Cities Public Television|TPT]] Public Television to launch the Emmy-Award winning PBS children's television series ''[[DragonflyTV]]'', which led to the 2010 launch of the spinoff series ''[[SciGirls]]'', both produced by TPT Public Television.  Project ''Dragonfly'' also oversees two national exhibit projects: Wild Research and iSaveSpecies, which are creating public research stations at zoos and aquariums nationwide to engage families in science inquiry and conservation action. The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has called ''Dragonfly'' "A true innovation and a model of what active learning should be."

==  Founding partners ==

===  Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden ===

[[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]] opened in 1875 and is the second oldest zoo in the nation. This national historical landmark hosts more than 500 animal species and 3,000 plant species. More than 1.2 million people visit the Cincinnati Zoo annually. A non-profit entity, the zoo is internationally known for its success in the protection and propagation of plants and animals in danger and engages in research and conservation projects around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Empirical legal studies''' ('''ELS''') is an approach to the study of [[law]], [[legal procedure]], and [[legal theory]] through the use of [[empirical]] research. Empirical legal researchers use research techniques that are typical of [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; however, ELS research tends to be more focused on purely legal questions than the related fields of [[law and economics]], [[legal psychology]], and [[sociology of law]].  ELS also tends to be more narrowly quantitative than fields such as [[Law and Society Association|law-and-society]] or [[new legal realism]] (NLR), which embrace [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[Social science|social science methods]], as well as [[Multimethodology|mixed method]] approaches.

In 2004, the ''[[Journal of Empirical Legal Studies]]'' was launched by the [[Society for Empirical Legal Studies]] and [[Cornell Law School]], and within three years rose to be ranked 28th of the over 800 US law journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx Law Journals: Submission and Ranking] Ranking of US Law journals by impact factor, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Euphronios Krater''' (or '''Sarpedon krater''') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[terra cotta]] calyx-[[krater]], a bowl used for [[Ancient Greece and wine|mixing wine with water]]. Created around the year 515 BC, it is the only complete example of the surviving 27 vases painted by the renowned [[Euphronios]] and is considered one of the finest Greek vase [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in existence. Part of the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1972 to 2008, the vase was [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriated]] to [[Italy]] under an agreement negotiated in February 2006, and is now in the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn and Michael W. Cothren. ''Art History''. Fourth Edition, vol. 1. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2011. p119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/07/news/franceschini_il_cratere_di_eufronio_resta_a_cerveteri_-126844061/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Euphronios krater stands 45.7&amp;nbsp;cm (18 inches) in height and has a [[diameter]] of 55.1&amp;nbsp;cm (21.7 inches). It can hold about 45 L (12 gallons). The style of the vase is [[red-figure pottery]], in which figure outlines, details, and the background are painted with an opaque black slip while the figures themselves are left in the color of the unpainted terracotta ceramic clay. 
 
The krater is decorated with two scenes.&lt;ref name="SchefoldGiuliani1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Schefold|author2=Luca Giuliani|title=Gods and Heroes in Late Archaic Greek Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA250|date=3 December 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32718-3|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode from the [[Trojan War]] is shown on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]; this illustration depicts the death of [[Sarpedon]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Laodamia]]. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the krater shows a contemporary scene of [[Athens|Athenian]] youths from the sixth century BC arming themselves before battle. In the scene of Sarpedon's death, the god [[Hermes]] directs the [[personification]]s of Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]) to carry the fallen away to his homeland for burial. While the subject of Sarpedon's death might normally be depicted as a stylized tableau, the figures in this scene are painted in naturalistic poses and with schematic, but accurate anatomy. This style is emblematic of the [[Pioneer Group]] of [[Archaic period in Greece|late Archaic]] painters, of whom Euphronios is considered the most accomplished. The scene of the anonymous Greek youths on the reverse shares this naturalistic style, using all the Pioneer Group's characteristic techniques of anatomical accuracy, natural poses, foreshortening, and spatial illusion.

Also characteristic of the Pioneer Group is the narrative tension created both by pairing these two scenes on the same piece, and by painting them in a common style. The death of Sarpedon, a quasi-mythological story which would be familiar to anyone viewing the krater, is an episode involving specific historical and mythological figures. The other scene, of the anonymous youths preparing for war, is both more general and explicitly contemporary. The young men are not heroes of legend; with their finely detailed features, they are given personality and character, but they could be any of the youthful soldiers in the Greek army. Both scenes are painted with similar styles, making the historical scene appear more contemporary; likewise, the contemporary scene begins to share some of the other's mythological qualities. The two scenes invite comparison between the narratives they depict; certainly, the hero Sarpedon was no less youthful than these anonymous boys, and Death and Sleep may well come for them as they did for him.

The vase is signed both by Euxitheos as [[Pottery|potter]] and [[Euphronios]] as [[Painting|painter]]. While it was customary for the painter to sign the finished work, it was less common for the potter to add his own name. The presence of both signatures indicates that Euxitheos felt the vase to be one of his finest works. Besides the artists' signatures on the obverse side, it also carries the inscription "Leagros is handsome." on the reverse. This inscription has allowed art historians to date the krater to approximately 520-510 BC, because at this time Leagros was considered the handsomest man in Greece. All names are written in [[Attic Greek|Attic letters]].

==History==
Records in Italian courts of an investigation indicate that the krater was [[Looted art|looted]] from an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[tomb]] in the Greppe Sant'Angelo near [[Cerveteri]] in December 1971. The krater was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by [[Robert E. Hecht]], an American [[antiquities]] dealer living in Rome, for [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million on November 10, 1972.&lt;ref name="LLC1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=7 December 1981|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=68–|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht, who was accused of trafficking in [[illicit antiquities]], claimed to have acquired the krater from Dikran Sarrafian, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] dealer, whose family had been in possession of the piece since 1920. Evidence suggests that Hecht may have purchased the krater in 1972 from [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]], an Italian dealer who was convicted of selling stolen art in 2005.&lt;ref name="WatsonTodeschini2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Watson|author2=Cecilia Todeschini|title=The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5uN8rvqaKYC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2007|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-438-5|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html?ref=world Euphronios Krater Returned - Art - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hoving]], director of the Met and the primary negotiator in the purchase, later said in his memoirs, ''Making the Mummies Dance'', "An intact red-figured Greek vase of the early sixth century B.C. could only have been found in Etruscan territory in Italy, by illegal excavators".&lt;ref name="Hoving1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hoving|title=Making the Mummies Dance: Inside The Metropolitan Museum Of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dItWAJxHT2MC|date=15 February 1994|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-88075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allay concerns, some six months after the krater was bought he prompted the Metropolitan Museum to send a private detective to Zurich in an endeavor to reinforce the cited Sarrafian provenance.&lt;ref name="HufnagelChappell2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Saskia Hufnagel|author2=Professor Duncan Chappell|title=Contemporary Perspectives on the Detection, Investigation and Prosecution of Art Crime: Australasian, European and North American Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXg3BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=28 October 2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-6313-9|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, following the trial of [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]] and related disclosures about antiquities smuggling, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Italian government signed an agreement under which ownership of the Euphronios krater and several other pieces of art was [[Art repatriation|returned]] to Italy in exchange for long-term loans of other comparable objects owned by Italy.  The krater remained on display at the Metropolitan Museum until January 2008, when it returned to Italy. It was unveiled in [[Rome]] on 18 January.&lt;ref&gt;Povoledo, Elisabetta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html Ancient Vase Comes Home to a Hero’s Welcome]. New York Times (19 January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The krater was displayed at the  Villa Giulia [[National Etruscan Museum]] in Rome from 2008-2014 until it was moved as part of a temporary display in the Cerveteri Museum celebrating the UNESCO World Heritage Site affiliation for the necropolis at Banditaccia.  Following the increase of attendance at the museum, the Cultural Heritage Minister, Dario Franceschini, has announced that the krater will remain at the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/07/news/franceschini_il_cratere_di_eufronio_resta_a_cerveteri_-126844061/&lt;/ref&gt;

Details from the krater's obverse have been used as a book cover illustration.  The [[Penguin Classics]] deluxe edition of [[Robert Fagles|Robert Fagles']] English translation of the [[Iliad]] employs a close-up of Thanatos for its front cover, and a close-up of Sarpedon for its back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |translator-last=Fagles |translator-first=Robert |editor1-last=Knox |editor1-first=Bernard |title=The Iliad |publisher=Penguin |date=1998 |edition=Penguin Classics Deluxe |isbn=9780140275360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Functional assessment''' is an ongoing process collecting information to understand the reason under a problem or target behavior. The function of the assessment is to prove and aid the effectiveness of the interventions or [[Therapy|treatments]] used to help eliminate the problem behavior. Through functional assessments we have learned that there are complex [[patterns]] to people's seemingly unproductive behaviors. It is important to not only pay attention to consequences that follow the behavior but also the antecedent that [[evokes]] the behavior. More work needs to be done in the future with functional assessment including balancing precision and [[efficiency]], being more specific with variables involved and a more smooth transition from assessment to intervention.&lt;ref name= "JABA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=Robert H|title=Functional Assessment: Contributions and Future Directions|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|issue=2|pages=401–404|pmc=1297816|pmid=16795831|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Functional assessment is a method developed by [[applied behavior analysis]] to identify the [[variable (research)|variable]]s that maintain a [[problem]] [[behavior]]. Behavior is [[lawful]]. Whether it is desirable or undesirable, behavior is controlled by environmental variables. Behavior is a function of the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[Operant conditioning|consequences]] that make up the three-term contingency. Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedent [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and consequences functional to the problem behavior. It attempts to provide an explanation to why the problem behavior may be occurring. The information about the antecedent stimuli may include the [[time]] and place, the presence of others and the [[frequency]]. The information collected helps identify which of the antecedent and consequences are maintaining the behavior. The information collected from functional assessment can also help develop appropriate treatments for the target behavior. Stimulus that may have been found to be [[reinforcing]] for the original behavior could be transferred to reinforce a more appropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Sandra L|title=Functional Assessment|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=April 2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=233|doi=10.1023/a:1022968200344}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 July 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MMPP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miltenberger|first=Raymond G|title=Behavior Modification Principles &amp; Procedures|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=United States|isbn=978-1-111-30611-3|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of problem behavior==
The purpose of conducting a functional assessment is to identify the function of the target behavior. There are four main classes of functions of problem behavior.&lt;ref name= "Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siebert|first=Carol|title=Functional Assessment: Process and Product|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=December 2006|volume=19|issue=1|pages=51–57|url=http://query.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/search/q?kw=functional+assessment&amp;facet[0]=addFacetValueFilters(ContentType,Journal+Article)|accessdate=5 August 2012|doi=10.1177/1084822306292516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social positive reinforcement===
Social positive reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[positive reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. This is include the giving of [[attention]], fun activities or goods and services provided by the person. An example of social positive reinforcement would be Max's mother ([[social]]) dropping what she is doing and provide attention (positive reinforcement) to her son when he engages in head banging on the wall (problem behavior).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Social negative reinforcement===
Social negative reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[negative reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. The person may terminate an aversive stimuli (interaction, task or activity) and the behavior is more likely to be maintained. An example of social negative reinforcement would be Max complains (problem behavior) to his parents (social) when he is asked to do chores, as a result, his parents allows him to escape the task (negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic positive reinforcement===
Automatic positive reinforcement is when a positive reinforcement occurs [[Automation|automatically]] and is not mediated by another person. The behavior is strengthened by an automatic reinforcing consequence. An example of automatic positive reinforcement would be an [[autistic]] child waving his hands in front of his face (problem behavior) because the [[sensory perception|sensory]] stimulation (automatic positive reinforcement) produced is reinforcing for the child.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic negative reinforcement===
Automatic negative reinforcement is when a negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing or eliminating an aversive stimulus as a reinforcing consequence of the behavior. A popular example of automatic negative reinforcement would be [[binge eating]]. Binge eating (problem behavior) had been found to temporarily reduce any unpleasant emotions the person may be experiencing before the binge (automatic negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Assessment methods==
There are various different methods used to conduct functional assessment, all of which falls into three distinct categories.&lt;ref name= "Furniss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furniss|first=Frederick|title=Assessment Methods|journal=Applied Behavior Analysis for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2009|volume=10|pages=33–36|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0088-3_3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect methods===
Indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews or surveys to gather information about the person exhibiting the behavior from themselves others who know this person well. The main advantage of indirect methods is they are easy and cheap to conduct and do not take much time. The main disadvantage of indirect methods is that the people involved are relying on their memories, thus some information may be lost or inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barribeau|first=Paul|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of the Survey Method|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/research/survey/com2d1.cfm|work=Survey Research. Writing@CSU.|publisher=Colorado State University Department of English.|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their convenience, indirect methods are used most commonly. It is essential assessment to be clear and objective  as this will produce the most accurate answers without interpretation. The goal of the indirect assessment method is to generate information on the antecedent, behavior and consequence that can help generate a hypothesis about the variables that maintains the behavior.

Indirect methods can help develop a [[correlation]] [[hypothesis]] but not a [[functional relationship]].

===Direct observation methods===
Direct observation methods involve is present to [[observe]] and record the problem behavior as it occurs. The goal of direct observation is to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a [[natural environment]]. The main advantage of direct observation is that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct observation is it requires a considerable amount of time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct observation is, like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.&lt;ref name= "Furniss" /&gt;

The observer of the direct observation method should be present in the natural environment when the problem behavior is most likely to occur. The observer should also be trained to record the problem behavior and its functional antecedent and consequences immediately, correctly and objectively.

Direct observation can also be can ABC observation. Together with indirect methods, direct and indirect assessments are categorized as descriptive assessment because the antecedent and consequences are described from with memory of events. The information collected aids the development of a hypothesis, but to demonstrate a functional relationship, one must use the experimental method.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Experimental methods===
Experimental methods involve manipulating either the antecedent or consequent variables to determine their influence on the problem behavior. This is the only method that can demonstrate a functional relationship between the antecedent stimulus or the reinforcing consequence and the problem behavior. The main advantage of the experimental method is the demonstration of a functional relationship. The main disadvantage of the experimental method is the extensive use of time and effort to create an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Gregory P|author2=Brian A Iwata |author3=Brandon E McCord |title=Functional analysis of problem behavior: a review.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=Summer 2003|volume=36|issue=2|pages=146–185|pmc=1284431|pmid=12858983|doi=10.1901/jaba.2003.36-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=RH|author2=EG Carr |author3=J Halle |author4=G McGee |author5=S Odom |title=The use of single-subject research to identify evidence-based practice in special education|journal=Exceptional children|year=2005|volume=71|issue=2|pages=165|url=http://www.freewebs.com/lowvisionstuff/Single_Subject.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1177/001440290507100203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental methods can also be called experimental analysis or functional analysis.

==Conducting a functional assessment==
A functional assessment should always be conducted before treating a problem behavior. To develop appropriate treatment, one must have the correct information about the antecedents and consequences controlling the behavior because treatment involves manipulating these environmental events to evoke a change in the problem behavior. Here is the proper procedure to correctly implement a functional assessment.&lt;ref name= "JABA" /&gt;

# The first step should start with a '''behavioral interview''' with the client or someone who knows him/her well.
# The interview from the first step should help '''develop a hypothesis''' about which antecedent would produce the behavior and which reinforcing consequence would maintain it.
# Once a hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to '''conduct a direct observation assessment''' in the natural environment. If the data collected from the interview is [[consistent]] with the observation, the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the hypothesis is strengthened.
# With the information from both sources being consistent, '''confirm your initial hypothesis''' to develop appropriate treatment plans for the identified antecedent and consequence.
# If the data collected from the behavioral interview and the information observed from the direct observation is inconsistent, '''conduct further assessments''' such as another interview or continued observation to clear up any of the inconsistencies.
# If after review and extra interviews and further observations, the information collected are still inconsistent, it is time to '''conduct a functional analysis'''. A functional analysis is also need if the information is consistent but can not lead to a conclusive, firm hypothesis about the [[predictably]] of the antecedent and consequence.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Functional interventions==
After a function assessment has been conducted with success, the information collected is used to develop appropriate treatments and interventions. Interventions are designed to manipulate the antecedent or/and the consequence of the problem behavior to decrease its occurrence rate and increase the rate of occurrence for more desirable behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Siebert" /&gt;

Functional interventions include [[extinction]], [[differential reinforcement]] and antecedent manipulations. These intervention are functional because they deal with the environmental events that are functional to the problem behavior. They are also nonaversive as punishment is not involved.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

More aversive interventions can be used as  latter resort if previous nonaversive intervention have been tried and shown ineffective. Punishment such as [[time-out (parenting)|time-out]] and response cost are considered [[negative punishment]], which although is still controversial, is more widely accepted than [[positive punishment]] such as overcorrection, contingent exercise, guided compliance and [[physical restraint]]. As mentioned punishment should only be used as a last resort when other methods have already been considered.

==Research==
A lot of [[research]] being done with functional assessment deals with self injurious behaviors of [[mentally challenged]] children or adults and [[autistic]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matson|first=Johnny L.|author2=Megan Sipes |author3=Max Horovitz |author4=Julie A. Worley |author5=Mary E. Shoemaker |author6=Alison M. Kozlowski |title=Behaviors and corresponding functions addressed via functional assessment|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|date=January 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=625–629|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089142221000301X|accessdate=5 August 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr, Newsom and Binkoff conducted an experimental method of functional assessment on the two boys with [[intellectual disabilities]] exhibiting [[aggressive]] behaviors. They hypothesized that their aggressive behaviors were maintained by escape from academic tasks. To test their hypothesis, they set two different experimental conditions; 1. Academic demands were put on the boys, 2. Academic demands were not put on the children. If their hypothesis is true, then the problem behavior should occur much more often in the first condition than the second. Results show that their hypothesis was indeed true as the aggressive behavior occurred at a much higher frequency in the first condition. The researchers concluded that the boy's problem behavior was indeed maintained by the antecedent of academic demands and the consequence of escape from the demands.

Another functional assessment research was done by Iwata in 1982 worked with children with [[developmental disabilities]] showing self injurious behaviors. The research could not conclude what was maintaining their behavior but believed it either adult attention, escape from demands or [[Sensory system|sensory]] stimulation from the injuries. For each of the hypothesis, they created a condition that would fit into the category. For adult attention hypothesis, they created an environment where an adult is in the room with the child but pays no attention to him/her until after the behavior occurs. For the escape from demands hypothesis, they had an adult make a normal demand towards the child, but terminate it if the self injurious behavior occurs. For the sensory stimulation hypothesis, the child is left alone without the presence of anyone or any stimulating activities. Iwata compared the levels of self injurious behaviors across the three conditions and demonstrated that the function of the problem behavior for each child was different. Some wanted attention, others escape while some were maintained by automatic reinforcement. As shown here, it is very important to conduct a functional assessment to determine what exactly is maintaining the behavior before any function interventions are taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iwata|first=Brian A|author2=Michael F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55560">This is a glossary of some of the terms used in [[phytopathology]].

Phytopathology is the study of plant diseases.  It is a multi-disciplinary science since prerequisites for disease development are the presence of a susceptible host species, a pathogen and the appropriate environmental conditions.  This is known as the [[glossary of phytopathology#disease triangle|disease triangle]].  Because of this interaction, the terminology used in phytopathology often comes from other disciplines including those dealing with the host species ([[Botany| botany / plant science]], [[plant physiology]]), the pathogen ([[Bacteria|bacteriology]], [[mycology]], [[Nematodes|nematology]], [[virology]]), the environment and disease management practices ([[agronomy]], [[soil science]], [[meteorology]], [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[plant breeding]], [[pesticides]], [[entomology]]), and areas of study that apply to both the host and pathogen ([[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular genetics]]).  The result is that most phytopathological glossary include terms from these other disciplines in addition to terms ([[glossary of phytopathology#disease incidence|disease incidence]], [[glossary of phytopathology#horizontal resistance|horizontal resistance]], [[glossary of phytopathology#gene-for-gene hypothesis|gene-for-gene relationship]], [[glossary of phytopathology#blast|blast]], [[glossary of phytopathology#scab|scab]] and so on) that are specific to, or which have a unique meaning in phytopathology. This glossary is no exception. However, for the sake of brevity, it has, for the most part, restricted terms from other disciplines to those that pertain to the pathogen.  At some point, these terms should be moved to other glossaries (e.g. [[glossary of mycology]], [[glossary of nematology]], and so on).

[[File:Goseck Sonnenobservatorium 26.jpg|thumb|300px|Tile in the centre of the site showing axis alignment of the structure]]

The '''Goseck circle''' (German: ''Sonnenobservatorium Goseck'') is a [[Neolithic]] structure in [[Goseck]] in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. 

Its construction is dated to approximately the 49th century B.C., and it seems to have remained in use until about the 47th century B.C. It may thus be the oldest and best known of the [[Circular Enclosures|circular enclosures]] associated with the Central European Neolithic. Currently, the site is presented officially by the state archaeologists and the local association that looks after it as a ritual or cult structure. 

The circle consists of a concentric ditch 75 metres (246 feet) across and two palisade rings containing entrances in places aligned with sunrise and sunset on the [[winter solstice]] days and smaller entrances aligned with the summer solstice. Marketing materials have described it as one of the oldest "[[Solar observatory|Solar observatories]]" in the world, but sunrise and sunset during winter and summer solstices are the only evident astronomical alignments emphasized in the remains of the structure.   

The existence of the site was made public in August 2003, and it was opened for visitors in December 2005.

==Geography==
===Location===
The site is located on farmland near Goseck, in the ''Burgenlandkreis'' of Saxony-Anhalt, between [[Naumburg]] and [[Weißenfels]]. The circle sits on a piece of land that gradually rises toward the south, not far from where the [[Unstrut]] flows into the [[Saale]], at the border of the region known as [[Leipzig Bay]].&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

==History==
=== Discovery and excavation ===
The circle was discovered in 1991 by Otto Braasch on an [[aerial survey]] photograph that showed circular ridges under a wheat field. The [[cropmark]]s were easy to see in a season of drought. The structure's visibility also indicated an advanced state of erosion.&lt;ref name = "AID"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Literski-Henkel |first=&lt;!-- Archaeologist --&gt;Norma |title=Das "Sonnenobservatorium" von Goseck |trans-title=The "solar observatory" of Goseck |work=Archäologie in Deutschland|date=February 2017|issn=0176-8522 |location=Stuttgart, Germany |language = de |publisher=Konrad Theiss (Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft)|pages=70-71 |url=https://www.aid-magazin.de/nc/zeitschrift/einzelhefte-archiv/jahrgang-2017/heft-12017/denkmal/denkmal-himmelswege-ins-neolithikum.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To preserve the endangered remains, the ''Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Sachsen-Anhalt'' decided to conduct an excavation. It cooperated with the Institute for Prehistocric Archaeology of the [[University of Halle]]-Wittenberg. 

François Bertemes and Peter Biehl began a major excavation of the site in 2002. When archaeologists combined the evidence with GPS observations, they noticed that the two southern openings marked the sunrise and sunset of the [[winter solstice|winter]] and [[summer solstice]]s.

Radiocarbon dating places the construction of the site close to 4900 B.C., while the style of the pottery shards associate it with the stroke-ornamented ware culture of ca. 4700 B.C., suggesting that the site remained in use throughout two or three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=François |last1=Bertemes |first2=Andreas |last2=Northe |chapter=Der Kreisgraben von Goseck: ein Beitrag zum Verständnis früher monumentaler Kultbauten Mitteleuropas |trans-chapter=The circular ditch of Goseck: A contribution to the understanding of early monumental cult buildings of Central Europe |editor-last=Schmotz | editor-first=Karl | title=Vorträge des 25.

Excavators also found the remains of what may have been ritual fires, animal and human bones, and a headless skeleton near the southeastern gate, that could be interpreted as evidence of [[human sacrifice]] or specific burial ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | url=http://www.faz.net/1.69239 | title=Menschenopfer in Europas ältestem Sonnenobservatorium | work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] | date=8 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bertemes and Biehl have continued the excavation for a few weeks each year. In 2004, a group from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] joined the ongoing dig. 

Since the end of the excavation, the site has been reconstructed. Archaeologists and state officials have rebuilt the wooden palisade of the circle using 1,675 oak poles with a height of 2.5 m. Woodworkers worked with hand tools so that the wooden posts would look authentic. The site was opened to the public on 21 December 2005, the day of the winter solstice.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Goseck-2.jpg|thumb|300px|Drawing of the Goseck circle - yellow lines represent the direction in which the sun rises and sets at the [[winter solstice]], while the vertical line shows the astronomical [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]]]

The site is surrounded by a circular v-shaped moat of up to 1.8 m depth. The soil was used to create a rampart on the outside. The diameter of the moat is 75 m, measured from its external border. A double wooden palisade stood inside the moat. No traces of internal buildings were found. Entry to the site was via three symmetrical main entrances to the north, southwest, and southeast. In addition there were small gaps in the palisades allowing access. The moat followed the three main entries outward (see diagram). The entrances in the inner palisade were narrower than those in the outer, which in turn, were narrower than the gap in the moat.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

The southwestern and southeastern entrances face the direction of sunset and sunrise around the date of the winter solstice. Two of the smaller breaks in the wall face toward the equivalent direction on the summer solstice.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

There is no sign of fire or of other destruction. Why the site was abandoned is unknown. Later villagers built a defensive [[moat]] following the ditches of the old enclosure.

==Astronomical alignment and interpretation==
The Goseck ring is one of the best preserved and extensively investigated of the many similar structures built at around the same time. Approximately 140 of these structures, known as [[Circular Enclosures|circular enclosures]], have been found. Although they all have unique features, they follow a basic architectural principle. Few of them have been excavated.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

In the first opening of this site, state archaeologist Harald Meller called it "a milestone in archaeological research".{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Its construction is dated to approximately the 49th century B.C., and it seems to have remained in use until about the 47th century B.C. This corresponds to the transitional phase between the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[Linear Pottery culture|Linear Pottery]] and [[Stroke-ornamented ware culture|Stroke-ornamented ware]] cultures. It is one of a larger group of circular enclosures in the [[Elbe]] and [[Danube]] region, most of which show similar solstice alignments.

There has been some debate about whether the site was used to monitor the sun throughout the year or only on specific notable days, and thus about whether calling the site a "solar observatory" is appropriate. Some{{who|date=March 2018}} have suggested the name was adopted primarily for marketing purposes.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;
Archaeologist Ralf Schwarz suggests the structures at the site allowed coordinating an easily judged [[lunar calendar]] with the more demanding measurements of a [[solar calendar]] through calendar calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schwarz, ''Kreisgrabenanlagen der Stichbandkeramikkultur in Sachsen-Anhalt'', Neolithic Circular Enclosures in Europe, International Workshop in Goseck (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) 7-9 May 2004  ([http://www.praehist.uni-halle.de/workshop.pdf abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Bertemes, Peter F.

== Interpretation ==
Some{{who|date=March 2018}} have claimed the sun and its annual calendar played a key role in the rituals performed at the site.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Tafeln-Goseck.jpg|thumb|300px|Information boards at the entrance of the ''Sonnenobservatorium Goseck'']]

The reconstructed site is open to the public. An information point has been opened at nearby ''Schloss Goseck'', featuring an exhibit and information on the excavations. The site is maintained by the ''Verein Gosecker Sonnenobservatorium e.V.''.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

Goseck is a stop on the [[tourist route]], ''Himmelswege'', linking archaeological sites in Saxony-Anhalt.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;

==Music career==
Alizâdeh was born in 1951 in [[Tehran]] to an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] father (from [[Urmia]]) and a [[Persian people|Persian]] mother (from [[Arak, Iran|Arak]]).&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hossein-aliz%C3%A2deh-mn0000264913/biography |title=Hossein Alizâdeh: Artist Biography|last=Harris|first=Craig|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager he attended [[secondary school]] at a music conservatory&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; until 1975. His music studies continued at the [[University of Tehran]], where his focus was [[Musical composition|composition]] and performance.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; He began postgraduate studies at the [[Tehran University of Art]]. After the [[Iranian Revolution]], he resumed his studies at the [[University of Berlin]], where he studied  composition and [[musicology]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Alizâdeh plays the ''[[Tar (string instrument)|tar]]'' and ''[[setar]]''. He has performed with two of Iran's national orchestras, as well as with the [[Aref Ensemble]], the Shayda Ensemble,&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; and [[Masters of Persian Music]]. In Europe, his first professional performance was with the Bejart Ballet Company’s orchestra in a performance of a [[Maurice Béjart]] ballet called ''Golestan''.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Over the years Alizâdeh's teachers have included [[Houshang Zarif]], [[Ali Akbar Shahnazi]], [[Nur-Ali Borumand]], [[Mahmoud Karimi (musician)|Mahmoud Karimi]], [[Abdollah Davami]], [[Yusef Forutan]], and [[Sa'id Hormozi]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">'''HCISec''' is the study of interaction between humans and computers, or [[human–computer interaction]], specifically as it pertains to [[information security]].  Its aim, in plain terms, is to improve the [[usability]] of security features in [[end user]] applications.  

Unlike HCI, which has roots in the early days of [[Xerox PARC]] during the 1970s, HCISec is a nascent field of study by comparison. Interest in this topic tracks with that of [[Internet security]], which has become an area of broad public concern only in very recent years.

When security features exhibit poor usability, the following are common reasons:

* they were added in casual afterthought
* they were hastily patched in to address newly discovered [[security bug]]s
* they address very complex [[use case]]s without the benefit of a [[Wizard (software)|software wizard]]
* their interface designers lacked understanding of related security concepts
* their interface designers were not usability experts (often meaning they were the application developers themselves)

'''Industrial waste''' is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of [[factories]], industries, mills, and mining operations. It has existed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maczulak |first=Anne Elizabeth |year=2010 |title=Pollution: Treating Environmental Toxins |url= |location=New York |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=120 |isbn=9781438126333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of industrial wastes are [[chemical solvent]]s, pigments, sludge, metals, ash, paints, sandpaper, paper products, industrial [[by-products]], and [[radioactive wastes]].

[[Toxic waste]], [[chemical waste]], industrial solid waste and [[municipal solid waste]] are designations of industrial wastes. [[Sewage treatment]] plants can treat some industrial wastes, i.e. those consisting of [[conventional pollutant]]s such as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). Industrial wastes containing [[toxic]] pollutants require specialized treatment systems. (''See'' [[Industrial wastewater treatment]]).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/pretreatment_program_intro_2011.pdf "Introduction to the National Pretreatment Program"] Document no. EPA-833-B-11-001. pp. 1-1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Impact ==
Production sites are commonly located near bodies of water due to industrial dependence on large amounts of water as an input. Many areas that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose of waste with lesser effects on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant. Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the [[Marine ecosystem|marine ecosystems]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wastes in Marine Environments|last=U.S. Congress|first=Office of Technology’ Assessment|publisher=Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wastewater containing nitrates and phosphates often causes [[Eutrophication]] which can kill off existing life in the water. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyawali at al.|first=|date=2012|title=Effects of Industrial Waste Disposal on the Surface Water Quality of U-tapao River, Thailand|url=http://www.ipcbee.com/vol32/019-ICESE2012-D10030.pdf|journal=2012 International Conference on Environment Science and Engieering|volume=32|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Management==

===In Thailand===
{{Main|Industrial waste management in Thailand}}

In [[Thailand]] the roles in [[Municipal solid waste|Municipal solid waste (MSW)]] management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided into central government, regional government, and local government. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible for stimulating regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating the central and local governments. The local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiaranaikhajorn|first1=Taweechai|title=Waste and Hazardous Substances Management Bureau|url=http://infofile.pcd.go.th/mgt/Overview_waste.pdf?CFID=818746&amp;CFTOKEN=13734972|publisher=Pollution Control Department (PCD), THAILAND|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the local governments do not dispose of the waste by themselves but instead hire private companies that have been granted the right from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pollution Control Department (PCD) Statement, THAILAND|url=http://www.pcd.go.th/about/en_ab_mission.html|publisher=Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111161400/http://www.pcd.go.th/about/en_ab_mission.html|archivedate=2014-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Visvanathan|first1=C.|title=Hazardous and Industrial Solid Waste Management in Thailand - an Overview|url=http://www.jgsee.kmutt.ac.th/jgsee1/NewsEvents/Seminar/ISSOWAMA/Visvanathan_Presentation.pdf|website=www.faculty.ait.ac.th/visu/|publisher=Asian Institute of Technology Thailand|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genco Background|url=http://www.genco.co.th/EN-About.htm|publisher=General Environment Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO)|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGS Thailand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SGS|url=http://www.sgs.co.th/en/Our-Company/About-SGS/Sponsorship.aspx|publisher=SGS (Thailand) Limited|accessdate=22 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111172910/http://www.sgs.co.th/en/Our-Company/About-SGS/Sponsorship.aspx|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste Management Siam LTD (WMS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Waste Management Siam LTD.

===In the United States===
{{main|Solid waste policy in the United States}}
The 1976 [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) provides for federal regulation of waste while allowing for individual state control through [[EPA]] approved waste disposal programs.

State compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met, action against the site will be taken. Compliance errors may be corrected by enforced cleanup directly by the site responsible for the waste or by a third party hired by that site.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/rcra/resource-conservation-and-recovery-act-rcra-overview#howdoesrcrawork|title=Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Overview {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this act, open dumping or releasing wastewater into nearby bodies of water were common waste disposal methods. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown et. al|first=|date=June 1977|title=Reassessing the History of U.S. Hazardous Waste
Disposal Policy - Problem Definition, Expert
Knowledge and Agenda-Setting|url=https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1332&amp;context=risk|journal=Risk: Health, Safety and Environment (1990-2002)|volume=8|pages=26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative externalities on human health and environmental health led to the need for such a regulations. The RCRA framework provides specified subsections defining nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials and how each should be properly managed and disposed of. Guidelines for the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste includes the banning of open dumping. Hazardous waste is monitored in a [[cradle to grave]] fashion.The EPA now manages 2.96 million tons of solid, hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment, the RCRA has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management evolves. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Isochronic tones''' are regular beats of a single [[Pitch (music)|tone]] that are used alongside [[monaural beats]] and [[binaural beats]] in the process called [[brainwave entrainment]]. At its simplest level, an isochronic tone is a tone that is being turned on and off rapidly. They create sharp, distinctive pulses of sound.

[[File:Koteka.jpg|thumb|Koteka souvenir]]
 
The '''koteka''', '''horim''',  or '''penis gourd''' is a [[penis]] sheath traditionally worn by native male inhabitants of some (mainly highland) ethnic groups in [[New Guinea]] to cover their genitals. They are normally made from a dried-out [[gourd]], ''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'', although other species, such as ''[[Nepenthes mirabilis]]'', are also used. They are held in place by a small loop of fiber attached to the base of the koteka and placed around the scrotum. There is a secondary loop placed around the chest or abdomen and attached to the main body of the koteka. Men choose kotekas similar to ones worn by other men in their cultural group. For example, [[Yali people|Yali]] men favour a long, thin koteka, which helps hold up the multiple rattan hoops worn around their waist. Men from [[Tiom]] wear a double gourd, held up with a strip of cloth, and use the space between the two gourds for carrying small items such as money and tobacco.

== Traditions ==
It is traditional [[clothing]] in certain [[New Guinea]] highlands societies including in the Grand [[Baliem Valley]] of [[Western New Guinea]] and the [[Ok Tedi]] and [[Telefomin]] regions of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is worn without other clothing, tied in upward position.

== Different identification ==
[[File:Koteka 2.jpg|thumb|Koteka]]
Many tribes can be identified by the way they wear their koteka. Some wear them pointed straight out, straight up, at an angle, or in other directions. The diameter of the koteka can also be a clue. Contrary to popular belief, there is little correlation between the size or length of the koteka and the social status of the wearer. Kotekas of different sizes serve different purposes: very short kotekas are worn when working and longer and more elaborate kotekas are worn on festive occasions. The koteka is made of a specially grown gourd. Stone weights are tied to the bottom of the gourd to stretch it out as it grows. Curves can be made in it by the use of string to restrain its growth in whatever direction the grower wishes. They can be quite elaborately shaped in this manner. When harvested, the gourd is emptied and dried. It is sometimes waxed with beeswax or native resins. It can be painted, or have shells, feathers and other decorations attached to it.

[[Sociolinguistic]]ally and [[political]]ly today, the term '''koteka''' is used as a name of tribal groups across the highlands of New Guinea, in both [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. For example, in West Papua today, there is an [[Koteka Tribal Assembly|Assembly of Koteka Tribes]]. The term ''koteka'' was never used to identify a society or ethnic group before, but it is now commonly known for a [[tribal group]] within [[Melanesia]] across the [[New Guinea Highlands|highlands of New Guinea]].

== Sexuality ==
It is commonly assumed that there is a sexual display element to wearing the koteka; however, according to the locals, kotekas are worn only to cover themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Attempted eradication ==
In 1971–1972 the Indonesian government launched "Operasi Koteka" ("Operation Penis Gourd") which consisted primarily of trying to encourage the people to wear shorts and shirts because such clothes were considered more "modern." But the people did not have changes of clothing, did not have soap, and were unfamiliar with the care of such clothes so the unwashed clothing caused skin diseases. There were also reports of men wearing the shorts as hats and the women using the dresses as carrying bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17388460.html|title=Cover up.(modernization programs in Iran Jaya province in Indonesia)|date=29 July 1995|publisher=The Economist (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the campaign was abandoned. Nevertheless, western clothing is required in government buildings, and children are required to wear western clothing in school.

== Different uses ==
[[File:Lonka-lonka.jpg|thumb|Lonka Lonka]]
Phallocrypts are decorative penis sheaths worn in parts of [[New Guinea]] during traditional ceremonies. They are usually made out of gourds or woven fibers and decorated with feathers, beads, [[cowry]] shells, and small metal ornaments. The most elaborate phallocrypts are sold to tourists as souvenirs and are not usually representative of ones actually used in ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

A phallocrypt can also be a simple ornament hung from male [[genitalia]] as part of a cultural expression, for ceremonial use or pure decoration. Among a number of ancient and modern people throughout the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] world, Africa and many parts of the Americas it was (and still is in some places) a common form of ornamentation. Some Aboriginal peoples of Australia wore an ornate carved pearl shell type called a Lonka Lonka. It is hung from the genitals by a twisted thong made of human hair. They are often ornately engraved with mainly geometric patterns and the grooves were colored with reddish ochre. Some South American cultures actually hung heavy, carved jade and other hardstone ornaments from piercings through the skin of their penis and scrotum. These were usually of a temporary ritualistic nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
===South America and Africa===
Some native South American tribes have used them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=X-AkAk9yW_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=penis+sheath+-Guinea+-koteka&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-7TftPfXAhWGBZoKHQxqB9UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=penis+sheath&amp;f=false|title=Advances in the Study of Behavior|date=26 March 1979|publisher=Academic Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in Brazil and the Amazon rainforest area.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=X-AkAk9yW_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=penis+sheath+-Guinea+-koteka&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-7TftPfXAhWGBZoKHQxqB9UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20sheath&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of penis gourds has also been documented in tropical Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Heiser CB (1979) The Gourd Book. University of Oklahoma Press, p. 145-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heiser CB (1973). The penis gourd of New Guinea. ''[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]]'' '''63''': 312–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Penis sheaths were sometimes worn by ancient Romans, often by singers since it was believed that it helped preserve their voice, but also by slaves or regular people to avoid sex.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=lSyY-OWFuGIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=roman+penis+fibula&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY6tTNzvbXAhXDF5oKHS73AbsQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20sheath&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRC has focused primarily on aeronautical research, but has also tested space hardware at the facility, such as the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]. In addition, a number of the earliest high-profile space missions were planned and designed on-site.

Established in 1917 by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), the research center devotes two-thirds of its programs to [[aeronautics]], and the rest to [[outer space|space]]. LaRC researchers use more than 40 [[wind tunnel]]s to study and improve [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] safety, performance, and efficiency.  Between 1958 and 1963, when NASA (the successor agency to NACA) started [[Project Mercury]], LaRC served as the main office of the [[Space Task Group]].

In June 2015, after previously serving as associate director, then deputy director, Dr. David E. Bowles was appointed director of NASA Langley.&lt;ref name="David Bowles"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bob Allen|title=Dr. David E.

== History ==
[[File:Langley Research Center aircraft - EL-1996-00055.jpeg|thumb|A variety of research aircraft at NASA Langley in 1994]]
After [[Woodrow Wilson#Events leading to U.S. entry into World War I .281914.E2.80.9316.29|US-German relations had deteriorated from neutral to hostile]] around 1916, the prospect of [[American entry into World War I|U.S. war entry]] became possible. On February 15, 1917, the newly established [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|Aviation Week]] warned that the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|U.S. military aviation]] capability was less than what was operating in the [[World War I|European war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.aviationweek.com/issue/19170215 Aviation &amp; Aeronautical Engineering], February 15, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent [[Jerome Clarke Hunsaker|Jerome Hunsaker]] to Europe to investigate, and Hunsaker's report prompted Wilson to command the creation of the nation's first aeronautics laboratory, which became NASA Langley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://aviationweek.com/defense/aviation-week-s-warning-and-founding-nasa-langley |title=Aviation Week’s Warning and the Founding of NASA Langley |author=Joe Anselmo |publisher=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] |date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--war in April 1917 [[American_entry_into_World_War_I#Germany]] --&gt;

In 1917, less than three years after it was created, the [[NACA]] established Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on Langley Field. Both Langley Field and the Langley Laboratory are named for aviation pioneer [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]].&lt;ref name="vp110905"&gt;{{cite news |first=Diane |last=Tennant |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |title=What's in a name?

The first research facilities were in place and aeronautical research was started by 1920. Initially the laboratory included four researchers and 11 technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://history.nasa.gov/monograph12/ch3.htm | title = Journey in Aeronautical Research: a Career at NASA-Langley Research Center, ch. 3 | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langley Field and NACA began parallel growth as air power proved its utility during World War I.  The center was originally established to explore the field of aerodynamic research involving airframe and propulsion engine design and performance.  In 1934 the world's largest wind tunnel was constructed at Langley Field with a 30 × 60 foot test section; it was large enough to test full-scale aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 "Faster, Safer Planes, Developed In Biggest Wind Tunnels"] ''Popular Science'', April 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA520 "Full-Size Planes Tested In Big Air Tunnel"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1935, pp. 520–521&lt;/ref&gt;  It remained the world's largest wind tunnel until the 1940s, when a 40 × 80 foot tunnel was built at NASA [[Ames Research Center]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/Research/facilities/windtunnels.html |title=40 X 80 and 80 X 120 Foot Wind Tunnels |website=Rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210532/http://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/Research/facilities/windtunnels.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1945, the center expanded to include rocket research, leading to the establishment of [[Wallops Flight Facility|a flight station]] at [[Wallops Island, Virginia]].  A further expansion of the research program permitted Langley Research Center to orbit payloads, starting with NASA's [[Explorer 9]] [[balloon satellite]] in mid-February 1961.  As rocket research grew, aeronautics research continued to expand and played an important part when subsonic flight was advanced and supersonic and hypersonic flight were introduced.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Langley Research Center can claim many historic firsts, some of which have proven to be revolutionary scientific breakthroughs. These accomplishments include the development of the concept of research aircraft leading to supersonic flight, the world's first transonic wind tunnels, the Lunar Landing Facility providing the simulation of lunar gravity, and the Viking program for Mars exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gis.larc.nasa.gov/historic | title = NASA Langley History and Description: Initial Activities | publisher = NASA LaRC Master Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center also developed standards for the grooving of aircraft runways based on a previous British design used at [[Washington National Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGuire|first1=R.C.|title=REPORT ON GROOVED RUNWAY EXPERIENCE AT  WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19690011108|website=Internet Archive|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Landing performance#Runway surface|Grooved runways]] reduce [[aquaplaning]] which permits better grip by aircraft tires in heavy rain. This grooving is now the international standard for all runways around the world.

LaRC supported the design and testing of the [[hypersonic]] [[NASA X-43|X-43]], which achieved a [[Guinness World Records|world speed record]] of [[Mach number|Mach]] 9.6 (almost 7,000 miles per hour). LaRC assisted the NTSB in the investigation of the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 587]].&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43-main.html |title=NASA – Hypersonic X-43A Takes Flight |website=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.larc.nasa.gov/historic/ |title=NASA Cultural Resources (CRGIS) – NasaCRgis |website=Gis.larc.nasa.gov |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;

==Fabrication research and development==
[[File:NASA LRC Materials Research Lab.jpg|center|thumb|800px|LRC materials research lab]]

===Electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF³)===
{{advert section|date=March 2017}}
The [[Electron beam freeform fabrication|EBF³ process]] produces structural metallic parts with immense strength, useful in performing repairs in remote locations. Additionally, the ability to build functionally graded, unitized parts directly from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] data offers enhanced performance in numerous applications. Recently, LaRC has become home to this new type of machining process, which is used by their new room-sized electron-emitting device, which uses a High Frequency 42&amp;nbsp;kW, [[X-ray]] emitting [[electron]] gun (similar to [[Cathode Ray Tube]]s), which quickly melts either [[aluminum]] or [[titanium]] wire (positioned by dual independent wire feeders) into the desired 3-dimensional metallic parts with a material strength comparable to that of wrought products. The machine's deposition rate is 150 in³/h (690&amp;nbsp;mm³/s), equivalent to its plastic-fabricating counterpart. Metallic parts are also built directly from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] without molds or tools, leaving the end product with absolutely no [[porosity]]. Other properties include:

* 6-[[Coordinate axis|axis]] positioning
* Heated or cooled platen
* 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]] [[vacuum]] capability (needed for the high power Electron beam gun)
* 72 × 24 × 24&amp;nbsp;inch build envelope
* Power efficiency in excess of 90%
* Near 100% feedstock efficiency
* Can deposit reflective materials not processable with [[lasers]]
* Potential portable EBF³ system (Under Development)
* Potential Fabrication &amp; repair from the plants to the [[planets]]
* Research assistance for developing large scale fabrication in space

Overall, Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication is a layer-additive technique that offers potential for improvements in cost, weight, and performance to enhance mission success for aircraft, launch vehicles, and spacecraft.

===Plastic fabrication===

LaRC also houses a large collection of various inexpensive [[plastic reformation]] machines. These machines are critical in the [[freeform fabrication]] department for faster timing, better precision, and larger quantities of low-cost toy, [[Physical model|model]], and [[Industry|industrial]] plastic parts. The fabrication of plastic parts is not all that dissimilar to the EBF³ process, except the melting apparatus is a thin, grated [[heating element]], but other than that they are quite similar, e.g. they are both run completely by CAD data and deal with various freeform fabrication of raw materials. Plastic reformation machines have also come to the interest of graphical artist, opening a whole new world of bringing their [[masterpiece]]s to life, all with a 'flick' of a switch, so to speak.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Since the start of [[Project Gemini]], Langley was a center for training of [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] in space.  In 1965, Langley opened the [[Lunar Landing Research Facility]] for simulations of moon landings with a mock [[Apollo Lunar Module]] suspended from a gantry over a simulated lunar landscape. There was experimental work on some [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]]s (LLRV).

=== Mars ===
Langley Research Center supported NASA's mission by designing a spacecraft for a [[Mars]] landing. (see the [[Mars Exploration Rover]].)

===Earth science===
Langley Research Center conducts [[earth science]] research to support NASA's mission.

==Awards==
LRC scientists and engineers have won the [[Collier Trophy]] 5 times.  In 1929 for the development of low-drag cowling for radial air-cooled aircraft engines, 1946 to [[Lewis A. Rodert]], [[Lawrence D. Bell]] and [[Chuck Yeager]] for the development of an efficient wing deicing system, 1947 to [[John Stack (engineer)|John Stack]] of the then Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory for research to determine the physical laws affecting supersonic flight, also shared in this trophy for their work on supersonic flight, 1951 to John Stack for the development and use of the slotted-throat wind tunnel, 1954 [[Richard T. Whitcomb]] for the development of the [[Whitcomb area rule]], according to the citation, a "powerful, simple, and useful method of reducing greatly the sharp increase in wing drag heretofore associated with transonic flight, and which constituted a major factor requiring great reserves of power to attain supersonic speeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/LaRC_History.html |title=Exploring NASA's Roots – The History of the Langley Research Center &amp;#124; NASA |website=Nasa.gov |date=1992-12-31 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''News from Nowhere''''' (1890) is a classic work combining [[utopian socialism]] and [[soft science fiction]] written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer [[William Morris]]. It was first published in serial form in the ''[[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]]'' journal beginning on 11 January 1890. In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and awakes to find himself in a future society based on [[common ownership]] and democratic control of the [[means of production]]. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work.

The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris fuses [[Marxism]] and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship—and through them for a reborn self—he encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Silver, Carole. The Romance of William Morris. Athens, Ohio: Ohio UP, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolishment of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work.

In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common [[criticisms of socialism]]; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communistic society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. ''News From Nowhere'' was written as a [[libertarian socialist]] response to an earlier book called ''[[Looking Backward]]'', a book that epitomises a kind of [[state socialism]] that Morris abhorred. It was also meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time regarding the tactics to bring about socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anarchism and Utopia: William Morris's News from Nowhere |author=Michael Holzman |journal=ELH |volume=51 |issue=3 |date=1984 |pages=589–603 |doi=10.2307/2872939 |jstor=2872939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Looking Backward'' ==
Morris reviewed the novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in the ''[[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]]'' on 21 June 1889. In his review, Morris objects to Bellamy's portrayal of his imagined society as an authority for what socialists believe. Morris writes,
'In short a machine life is the best which Mr. Bellamy can imagine for us on all sides; it is not to be wondered at then that this, his only idea for making labour tolerable is to decrease the amount of it by means of fresh and ever fresh developments of machinery… I believe that this will always be so, and the multiplication of machinery will just multiply machinery; I believe that the ideal of the future does not point to the lessening of men's energy by the reduction of labour to a minimum, but rather the reduction of pain in labour to a minimum, so small that it will cease to be pain; a dream to humanity which can only be dreamed of till men are even more completely equal than Mr. Bellamy's utopia would allow them to be, but which will most assuredly come about when men are really equal in condition.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first= William|title=Bellamy's Looking Backward|work=The William Morris Internet Archive Works (1889)|accessdate=14 April 2008|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1889/backward.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris’s basic antipathy with Bellamy arose chiefly from his disagreement with Bellamy’s social values and aesthetic convictions. While Bellamy favoured the urban, Morris favoured the pastoral; while Bellamy lauded the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the power of the machine, Morris yearned for the restoration of an organic way of life which utilised machines only to alleviate the burdens which humans might find irksome; while Bellamy sought salvation through an omnipotent state, Morris wished for a time when it would have withered away.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

More specifically, Morris criticised the limited nature of Bellamy's idea of life. He identifies five concerns – work, technology, centralisation, cities, arts – which demonstrates the "half change" advanced in ''Looking Backward''. Morris's review also contains an alternate future society in each of these instances. This was the framework based on which he would later attempt to elaborate his vision of an utopia in ''News From Nowhere''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, W. (2003). ''News From Nowhere''. Leopold, D (Ed.). New York, Oxford University Press Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender in Nowhere==
In ''News From Nowhere'' Morris describes women in the society as ‘respected as a child bearer and rearer of children desired as a woman, loved as a companion, un-anxious for the future of her children’ and hence possessed of an enhanced 'instinct for maternity'. The sexual division of labour remains intact. Women are not exclusively confined to domestic labour, although the range of work they undertake is narrower than that of man; but domestic labour is seen as something for which women are particularly fitted.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitas|first= Ruth|title=Who Holds the Hose? Domestic Labor in the Work of Bellamy, Gillman, and Morris - Ebsco Host : Academic Search Premier 6 (1996)|accessdate= 15 March 2008|url=http://corvette.salemstate.edu:2561/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=3&amp;sid=a7ff7a45-7fc8-4ef0-9c41-0ca33040fd09%40sessionmgr9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ‘The men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising over the women, or the women over the men; both of those took place in old times. The women do what they can do best and what they like best, and the men are neither jealous nor injured by it.’&lt;ref name=Nowhere/&gt; 
The practice of women waiting on men at meals is justified on the grounds that, 
‘It is a great pleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do so that all house-mates about her look pleased and are grateful to her. And then you know everybody likes to be ordered about by a pretty woman…’&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

Morris presents us with a society in which women are relatively free from the oppression of men; while domestic work, respected albeit gender-specific in Morris's work here as elsewhere, is portrayed as a source of potential pleasure and edification for all denizens of his Utopia.

== Marriage ==
Morris offers a Marxian view of marriage and divorce. Dick and Clara were once married with two children. Then Clara ‘got it in her head she was in love with someone else,’ so she left Dick only to reconcile with him again.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Jan. "Concerning Love: News From Nowhere and Gender." William Morris &amp; News from Nowhere: A Vision for Our Time. Eds. Stephen Coleman and Paddy O'Sullivan. (Bideford, Devon: Green Books, 1990): 107–125&lt;/ref&gt; Old Hammond informs the reader that there are no courts in ''Nowhere'', no divorce in ''Nowhere'', and furthermore no contractual marriage in ''Nowhere''. When dealing with marriage and divorce Old Hammond explains,
‘You must understand once for all that we have changed these matters; or rather that our way of looking at them has changed…We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we can get rid of all the trouble that besets the sexes… but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and position, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been the result of love or lust.'&lt;ref name=Nowhere&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Nowhere people live in groups of various sizes, as they please, and the nuclear family is not necessary.

Concerning marriage, the people of ''Nowhere'' practice monogamy but are free to pursue romantic love because they are not bound by a contractual marriage.

== Education ==
Early in the novel we learn that though the people of ''Nowhere'' are learned there is no formal schooling for children. Although Oxford still exists as a place to study the 'Art of Knowledge', we learn that people are free to choose their own form of education. As for educating children, we learn that children in ''Nowhere''
‘often make up parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in the summer time, living in tents, as you see. We rather encourage them to do it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to know the wild creatures; and you see the less they stew inside houses the better for them.’&lt;ref name=Nowhere/&gt;

Here Morris breaks away from the traditional institutions of 19th century England. Learning through nature is the best suited lifestyle for this agrarian society.

== How We Might Live ==
''News from Nowhere'' is a [[utopia]]n representation of Morris’ vision of an ideal society. "Nowhere" is in fact a literal translation of the word "utopia".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|utopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Utopia, an imagined society, is idyllic because the people in it are free from the burdens of industrialisation and therefore they find harmony in a lifestyle that coexists with the natural world.
In a lecture "How We Live and How We Might Live" 1884, Morris gives his opinions about an ideal existence. This opinion is the bedrock for the novel. Morris writes,
'Before I leave this matter of the surroundings of life, I wish to meet a possible objection. I have spoken of machinery being used freely for releasing people from the more mechanical and repulsive part of necessary labour; it is the allowing of machines to be our masters and not our servants that so injures the beauty of life nowadays. And, again, that leads me to my last claim, which is that the material surroundings of my life should be pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilised community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salmon|first= Nicholas|title=Works|work=Marxist Internet Archive|accessdate= 14 April 2008|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
{{Move section to wikiquote}}
* As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes' walk from his own house, which stood on the banks of the [[Thames]], a little way above an ugly suspension bridge. He went out of the station, still discontented and unhappy, muttering "If I could but see it! if I could but see it!" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says our friend who tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to slip off him.
* "I think I know what you mean. You think that I have done you a service; so you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to a neighbour, unless he has done something special for me. I have heard of this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it. And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my business, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very queer. Besides, if one person gave me something, then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos of friendship."
* All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made the old man talk more. But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for his great-grandfather. So he burst out laughing at last, and said: "Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it. Fancy people not liking to work! — it's too ridiculous. Why, even you like to work, old fellow — sometimes," said he, affectionately patting the old horse with the whip. "What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!"
* "Man alive! how can you ask such a question? Have I not told you that we know what a prison means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy books, helped out by our own imaginations? And haven't you specially called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours were shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly? And if there were people in prison, you couldn't hide it from folk, like you can an occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose, with a lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison business is. Prisons, indeed! O no, no, no!"
* "Then you suppose nonsense," said he. "I know that there used to be such lunatic affairs as divorce courts. But just consider; all the cases that came into them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear guest," said he, smiling, "that though you do come from another planet, you can see from the mere outside look of our world that quarrels about private property could not go on amongst us in our days."
* But of course I understand your point of view about education, which is that of times past, when 'the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (i.e., the struggle for a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the slave-holders' privilege on the other), pinched 'education' for most people into a niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked it or not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been chewed and digested over and over again by people who didn't care about it in order to serve it out to other people who didn't care about it."
* "I must now shock you by telling you that we have no longer anything which you, a native of another planet, would call a government."
* "A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not? Folk used often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when for every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable starvelings. Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on the tyranny; a tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible by any microscope I know. Don't be afraid, my friend; we are not going to seek for troubles by calling our peace and plenty and happiness by ill names whose very meaning we have forgotten!"
* "As a matter of fact, the history of the terrible period of transition from commercial slavery to freedom may thus be summarised. When the hope of realising a communal condition of life for all men arose, quite late in the nineteenth century, the power of the middle classes, the then tyrants of society, was so enormous and crushing, that to almost all men, even those who had, you may say despite themselves, despite their reason and judgement, conceived such hopes, it seemed a dream. So much was this the case that some of those more enlightened men who were then called Socialists, although they well knew, and even stated in public, that the only reasonable condition of Society was that of pure Communism (such as you now see around you), yet shrunk from what seemed to them the barren task of preaching the realisation of a happy dream. Looking back now, we can see that the great motive-power of the change was a longing for freedom and equality, akin if you please to the unreasonable passion of the lover; a sickness of heart that rejected with loathing the aimless solitary life of the well-educated man of that time: phrases, my dear friend, which have lost their meaning to us of the present day; so far removed we are from the dreadful facts which they represent."
* "Go back again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned that in spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into fellowship — but not before. Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all round you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their own, while they themselves care nothing for their own real lives — men who hate life though they fear death. Go back and be the happier for having seen us, for having added a little hope to your struggle. Go on living while you may, striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and happiness."

==Influence==
The title ''News from Nowhere'' has inspired many enterprises, including a [[Independent bookstore|political bookstore]] in Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=News From Nowhere Co-operative Ltd |url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk/ |title=News From Nowhere Radical &amp; Community Bookshop, Liverpool |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.org.uk |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theatre company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.net/ |title=Tim Crouch news from nowhere -news from nowhere |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.net |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a short film describing a fictional trip by Morris up the [[River Thames]] exploring ideas of aesthetic and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/63268/news-from-nowhere.html |title=News from Nowhere &amp;#124; review, synopsis, book tickets, showtimes, movie release date &amp;#124; Time Out London |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary art exhibition at the [[Lucy Mackintosh]] Gallery in Lausanne, Switzerland, with six British artists: Michael Ashcroft, Juan Bolivar, Andrew Grassie, Justin Hibbs, Alistair Hudson, and [[Peter Liversidge]] during April–May 2005 was called ''News From Nowhere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucymackintosh.ch/archives.php?id=19 |title=Galerie Lucy Mackintosh |publisher=Lucymackintosh.ch |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk singer [[Leon Rosselson]]'s song "Bringing the News from Nowhere", from his eponymous 1986 album, is a tribute to Morris.

''News From Nowhere'' was an influencing factor in historian [[G. D. H. Cole]]'s conversion to socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Margaret. ''The Life of G.D.H. Cole'', p.33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A track on ''[[Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!]]'' by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] (2008) is called "[[More News from Nowhere]]".

In 2008 Waltham Forest commissioned the composer, Mike Roberts, to create a new community symphony based on the story. Incorporating Morris' axiom of 'art for the people and by the people' the piece was written in collaboration with 180 primary school children - all composing small fragments of music that were weaved into the final piece.  The result was a 90-minute work for children's choir, orchestra and 10 other smaller ensembles.  The work is being recorded with the artistic support of The William Morris Gallery during 2014-15 for release in June 2015 to commemorate the novel's 125th anniversary.

The novel ''News from Gardenia'' (2012) by [[Robert Llewellyn]] was influenced by ''News from Nowhere''.

Korean artists Moon Kyungwon and Jeon Joonho were inspired by ''News from Nowhere'' in their collaborative project "News from Nowhere" (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.kr/ |title=Home : News from nowhere |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.kr |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the English band [[Darkstar (band)|Darkstar]] released an album titled ''News from Nowhere''.

The book was adapted by Sarah Woods as a radio play, broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 25 May 2016.

''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine hosts a monthly [[podcast]] by journalist Corey Pein called ''[https://thebaffler.com/latest/category/bafflercasts/news-from-nowhere News from Nowhere]'', inspired by Morris' book.

In [[computer networking]] and [[computer architecture]], a '''northbound interface''' of a component is an [[interface (computer science)|interface]] that conceptualizes the [[low level|lower level]] details (e.g., [[Data (computing)|data]] or [[Function (computer science)|functions]]) used by, or in, the component.  A northbound interface is used to interface with [[High and low level|higher level]] [[abstraction layer|layers]] using the '''southbound interface''' of the higher level component(s). In [[Computer architecture|architectural]] overviews, the northbound interface is normally drawn at the top of the component it is defined in, hence the name northbound interface.

A southbound interface decomposes concepts in the technical details, mostly specific to a single [[software component|component]] of the architecture.  Southbound interfaces are drawn at the bottom of an architectural overview.

Northbound interfaces normally talk to southbound interfaces of higher level components and vice versa.

==Typical use==

A northbound interface is typically an [[output (computing)|output]]-only interface (as opposed to one that accepts user input) found in [[Carrier Grade Open Framework|carrier-grade network]] and [[telecommunications network]] elements. The [[programming language|languages]] or [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] commonly used include [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] and [[Transaction Language 1|TL1]]. For example, a device that is capable of sending out [[syslog]] messages but that is not configurable by the user is said to implement a northbound interface. Other examples include [[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware|SMASH]], [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface|IPMI]], [[WSMAN]], [[SOAP]], etc.

The '''Owatonna Art Education Project''' was a project in [[Owatonna, Minnesota]] in the United States, intended to promote the production of new knowledge through science, establish standards of excellence in education, and provide opportunities for self-improvement and visual enhancement. It was started 1933 and continued until 1938. The findings were published in 1944.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">In [[operations management]] and [[industrial engineering]], '''production flow analysis''' refers to methods which share the following characteristics:

# Classification of machines
# Technological cycles information control
# Generating a binary product-machines matrix (1 if a given product requires processing in a given machine, 0 otherwise)

Methods differ on how they group together machines with products. These play an important role in designing [[manufacturing cells]].

==Rank Order Clustering==

Given a binary product-machines n-by-m matrix &lt;math&gt;b_{ip}&lt;/math&gt;, Rank Order Clustering&lt;ref&gt;King, J. R., Machine-component grouping in production flow analysis: an approach using a rank order clustering algorithm, International Journal of Production Research, Vol.18 1980 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207548008919662#.UeAI5eGLe1E&lt;/ref&gt; is an algorithm characterized by the following steps:

# For each row i compute the number &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p=1}^{m}b_{ip}*2^{m-p}&lt;/math&gt;
# Order rows according to descending numbers previously computed
# For each column p compute the number &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{ip}*2^{n-i}&lt;/math&gt;
# Order columns according to descending numbers previously computed
# If on steps 2 and 4 no reordering happened go to step 6, otherwise go to step 1
# Stop

Although Rank Order Clustering is one of the widely used production flow algorithms, there are some limitations to this method such as lack of consideration of real-world manufacturing data during clustering&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|title=Modified Rank Order Clustering Algorithm Approach by Including Manufacturing Data|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.103|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|volume=49|issue=5|pages=138–142|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the initial matrix is rearranged, then the resulting product-machine matrix would be different. To overcome these drawbacks, a robust Modified Rank Order Clustering algorithm was proposed by Nagdev Amruthnath&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iamnagdev.wordpress.com/|title=Hi! I am Nagdev|website=Hi! I am Nagdev|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Modified Rank Order Clustering==
Modified Rank Order Clustering (MROC) is a weight based rank order clustering approach which was proposed in 2016, to facilitate the needs of the real-world manufacturing environment. In this approach, machine performance data (such as cycle time, OEE and KPI's) and part information (such as volume) could be normalized and used as weights for machines and parts&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The initial machine and part matrix are set up based on the order of weights in descending order. By setting up the matrix using this approach, only one resulting final matrix is obtained and manufacturing data is embedded as weights overcoming the drawbacks of rank order clustering. MROC&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; algorithm is characterized by the following steps:
# Develop weight factors for part and machines &lt;math&gt;i_{w}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;j_{w}&lt;/math&gt; 
# If there are more than weight factors then, convert each weight factor into percentage and then sum it. Else assign the weight to the part numbers
# Create a n*m matrix &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; (binary number for part and machine). Where n is parts and m is machines
# Rearrange the parts and machines in descending order based on weights
# For each row of i compute, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{ij}*2^{m-j}&lt;/math&gt;
# Rearrange the rows in descending order based on the computed numbers
# For each row of j compute, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{ip}*2^{n-i}&lt;/math&gt;
# Rearrange the columns in descending order based on the computed numbers
# Repeat step 1 until there is no change is observed in step 3 and 5
# Stop

==Similarity coefficients==

Given a binary product-machines n-by-m matrix, the algorithm proceeds&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from MCauley, Machine grouping for efficient production, Production Engineer 1972 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04913845&lt;/ref&gt; by the following steps:

# Compute the similarity coefficient &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}=n_{ij}/(n_{ij}+u)&lt;/math&gt; for all  with &lt;math&gt;n_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; being the number of products that need to be processed on both machine i and machine j, u comprises the number of components which visit machine j but not k and vice versa.
# Group together in cell k the tuple (i*,j*) with higher similarity coefficient, with k being the algorithm iteration index
# Remove row i* and column j* from the original binary matrix and substitute for the row and column of the cell k, &lt;math&gt;s_{rk}=max(s_{ri*},s_{rj*})&lt;/math&gt;
# Go to step 2, iteration index k raised by one

Unless this procedure is stopped the algorithm eventually will put all machines in one single group.

==Refuge based on predator exclusion==
Prey animals typically maintain larger populations when they have a place to physically hide from predation.  For example, [[rat|rats]] maintain a higher [[population density]] if the rats have refuges such as tall grass, allowing them to hide from predators such as owls and cats.&lt;ref name="Lambert"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD| last1=Lambert|first1=Mark|title=Control Of Norway Rats In The Agricultural Environment: Alternatives To Rodenticide Use|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/27745/1/2003LambertMSPhD.pdf|publisher=University of Leicester|pages=85-103|language=English|format=Thesis|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sea birds often have nesting colonies on islands but not on nearby, apparently suitable, mainland sites.

==Refuge based on migration==
Many prey animals systematically [[animal_migration|migrate]] between refuges and predator-rich feeding grounds, in patterns that minimize their chances of being caught by the predators.
The largest such migration by [[biomass_(ecology)|biomass]] is the oceans' [[diel vertical migration]], in which vast quantities of organisms hide in the [[Deep_sea_community#Zones|lightless depths]] of the open ocean, arising after dark to consume [[phytoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/ocean-magic-at-night|title=Migration: World's Biggest Takes Place in Ocean at Night|publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows them to avoid the large [[Pelagic_fish#Predator_fish|predatory fish]] of the open ocean, as these predators are primarily visual hunters and need light to effectively catch prey.  Similar types of migration also occur in fresh water. For example, small [[European perch]] exhibit a daily horizontal migration in some lakes in Finland. During the day they move away from the vegetated areas where the predation threat in the clear water is great, into more turbid open water areas, moving back at night because of the greater availability of [[zooplankton]] among the aquatic plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Issues in Ecosystem Ecology: 2011 Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oettgWPNE6IC&amp;pg=PT464 |year=2012 |publisher=Scholarly Editions |isbn=978-1-4649-6482-4 |pages=464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge based on remoteness==
Refuge use reduces the likelihood of species extinction.&lt;ref name="FontanetoSanciangco2013" /&gt;  There have been a number of mass [[extinction event]]s. During some of these, denizens of the deep ocean have been relatively immune. The [[coelacanth]] for example, is a remnant species of a once common group of fishes, the [[Sarcopterygii]], which disappeared from shallow seas at the time of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago, leaving only a couple of surviving species.&lt;ref name=Priede&gt;{{cite book|author=Priede, Imants G. |title=Deep-Sea Fishes: Biology, Diversity, Ecology and Fisheries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBcwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|year=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-03345-6 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Renne |first=Paul R. |last2=Deino |first2=Alan L. |last3=Hilgen |first3=Frederik J. |last4=Kuiper |first4=Klaudia F. |last5=Mark |first5=Darren F. |last6=Mitchell |first6=William S. |last7=Morgan |first7=Leah E. |last8=Mundil |first8=Roland |last9=Smit |first9=Jan |title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary |journal=Science |date=7 February 2013 |volume=339 |issue=6120 |pages=684–687 |doi=10.1126/science.1230492 |pmid=23393261 |url=http://www.cugb.edu.cn/uploadCms/file/20600/20131028144132060.pdf |bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many coral [[Taxon|taxa]] have used the deep ocean as a refuge, shifting from shallow to deep water and vice versa during their evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=Woodley&gt;{{cite book|author1=Woodley, Cheryl M. |author2=Downs, Craig A. |author3=Bruckner, Andrew W. |author4=Porter, James W. |author5=Galloway, Sylvia B.|title=Diseases of Coral|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8gbCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA416 |year=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-8138-2411-6 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; By developing wings and taking flight, insects exploited the air as a refuge, a place of safety from ground-based predators; this successful evolutionary strategy set the insects on the path to occupying the dominant position they hold today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=La Greca, Marcello |year=1980 |title=Origin and evolution of wings and flight in insects |journal=Bollettino di Zoologia Italiana |volume=47 |pages=65–82 |doi=10.1080/11250008009438706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human societies show a similar effect, with remote mountainous regions such as [[Zomia]] or the [[Scottish Highlands]] serving as [[Refugium (population biology)| refugia]], allowing their inhabitants to maintain cultural traditions and languages that were being pushed to extinction in more accessible locations.&lt;ref name=Stringham&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringham |first1=Edward |title=Repelling States: Evidence from Upland Southeast Asia |journal=Review of Austrian Economics |date=2012|volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sowell |first1=Thomas|title=Basic Economics |date=2015 |isbn=978-0465060733 |pages=536-537 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge based on size==
Refuge strategies are often dependent on the size of the prey. The smallest individuals find it easiest to tuck themselves away in some hole or cranny, or if, like [[barnacle]]s, they are living on an exposed surface, are of negligible interest to predators like [[starfish]] because of their small size. Larger individuals are of interest, but they take refuge by settling further up the shore where the starfish cannot reach them when the tide is out, nor can [[whelk]]s drill through their shells because they remain submerged for insufficient time during each tidal cycle.&lt;ref name=Ricketts/&gt; In this situation, size is a refuge in itself, in that it enables the barnacle to escape desiccation under circumstances that might be lethal to smaller individuals.&lt;ref name=Ricketts&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ricketts, Edward Flanders |author2=Calvin, Jack |author3=Hedgpeth, Joel Walker |author4=Phillips, David W. |title=Between Pacific Tides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUl5ESavtRIC&amp;pg=PA477 |year=1985 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2068-7 |page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[tidepool sculpin]], which takes refuge in small rockpools when the tide is out, thus taking advantage of its small size and avoiding its larger fish predators.&lt;ref name=Kruckeberg&gt;{{cite book |author=Kruckeberg, Arthur R.|title=The Natural History of Puget Sound Country |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqtVmRNdHWwC&amp;pg=PA90 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-97477-4 |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|regular tunings of musical scales in general|alternative tunings of the guitar known as "regular"|Regular tuning}}

In the traditional theory of music, a '''regular temperament''' is an assignment of relative [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es to the notes of the [[chromatic scale]] (i.e. a ''[[musical tuning|tuning]]'' of this scale),&lt;ref&gt;The relative pitches assigned to this scale are naturally inherited by its subscales—the [[diatonic and chromatic#Diatonic scales|diatonic major]] scales and their [[relative minor]]s and its [[pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|pentatonic subscales]], for instance. All regular temperaments other than [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]] and its derivatives also naturally generate relative pitch assignments for extra notes which can be (and have been) used to create extensions of the chromatic scale to more than 12 notes.&lt;/ref&gt; in which every interval of a [[perfect fifth]]&lt;ref&gt;Premises of this definition are that octaves are untempered—that is, the frequencies of their end-points are in the ratio of 2 to 1—, that every octave is identically divided by notes selected from the same set of [[pitch class]]es and that a "perfect fifth" is the interval between the first and fifth [[scale degree]]s of a [[diatonic major scale]], however tuned. Equivalently, it is the interval formed by juxtaposing 4 [[diatonic semitone]]s and 3 [[chromatic semitone]]s,  or  the interval between the notes sounded by two keys separated by 6 others on a standard [[musical keyboard]], not necessarily tuned according to the now standard [[Equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]], and with the proviso that if the upper note is a flat then so is the lower, and if the lower note is a sharp then so is the upper.  The term "perfect" is used here solely to distinguish the interval referred to from [[augmented fifth|augmented]] and [[diminished fifth#Augmented fourth and diminished fifth|diminished fifth]]s (such as the interval between B and F), and does not imply that the fifth has to be [[Just intonation|just]].&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Musical temperament|tempered]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, has had the frequency ratio between its end-points adjusted to be close to, but not exactly equal to, its just value of 3/2.  The purpose of this tempering is commonly to reduce the frequency ratio between the end-points of the  [[major third]]s and [[minor sixth]]s and increase that between the end-points of the [[minor third]]s and [[major sixth]]s so that they are closer to their just values of 5/4, 5/3, 6/5 and 8/5 respectively.  In practice, this means that the frequency ratio between the end-points of the tempered fifths will normally be less than 3/2.&lt;/ref&gt; by the same amount.&lt;ref&gt;Bergholt ([[#CITEREFBergholt1895|1895]]; 212, p.510; 214, p.637), Lloyd &amp; Boyle ([[#CITEREFLloydBoyle1978|1978]], p.163); Panetta ([[#CITEREFLPanetta1987|1987]], [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OoyCpZhaxQ4C&amp;pg=PA15 p.15]); Lindley &amp; Turner-Smith ([[#CITEREFLindleyTurner-Smith1993|1993]], p.43); Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n13/mode/1up xi], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/32/mode/1up/search/tempered+third 32–44]); Donahue ([[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FTRADRMfld4C&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]); Duffin ([[#CITEREFDuffin2007|2007]], pp.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i5LC7Csnw7UC&amp;pg=PA39 39], 33–46); Blood ([[#CITEREFBlood2013|2013]], [https://www.dolmetsch.com/defst1.htm Tc-Te]); Di Veroli ([[#CITEREFDi Veroli2013|2013]], p.42); Dolata ([[#CITEREFDolata2016|2016]], [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DdQ4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 p.98]). Lindley ([[#CITEREFLindley1984|1984]], p.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=oXE5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8]), Lindley, ([[#CITEREFLindley2001|2001]], p.249) and Jorgensen ([[#CITEREFJorgensen1991|1991]] , p.776)  use the term "regular meantone temperament" to refer to the same concept.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tuning in which all the perfect fifths remain untempered&lt;ref&gt;That is, the frequency ratio between their end-points has its [[Just intonation|just value]] of 3/2.&lt;/ref&gt;  is called "[[Pythagorean tuning]]".  In this article, unless the context implies otherwise, the unqualified term "fifth" by itself will mean "perfect fifth".

Authorities differ as to which tunings they regard as being included amongst those they refer to as "temperaments", and therefore as to whether or not they include Pythagorean tuning amongst those they refer to as "regular temperaments". Some treat the term "temperament" as a synonym for "tuning",&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/431/mode/1up 431], [https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/433/mode/1up 433]), Bosanquet ([[#CITEREFBosanquet1889|1889]],  p.[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmusi00stai#page/421/mode/1up 421–2]), and Lloyd &amp; Boyle ([[#CITEREFLloydBoyle1978|1978]], p.162), for instance. Bosanquet defines "temperament" to mean "the division of the octave", and takes the division produced by what he calls the "Pythagorean system" to be one instance of this.&lt;/ref&gt; others reserve the term "temperament" for tunings that are not any form of [[just intonation]] (including Pythagorean tuning),&lt;ref&gt;Duffin ([[#CITEREFDuffin2007|2007]], p.[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i5LC7Csnw7UC&amp;pg=PA38 38]) and Blood ([[#CITEREFBlood2013|2013]], [https://www.dolmetsch.com/defst1.htm Tc-Te]), for example.&lt;/ref&gt; and one eminent musicologist, [[James Murray Barbour]], required a temperament to have at least one interval with an [[irrational number|irrational]] frequency ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n15/mode/1up pp.xii], [https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/5/mode/1up 5]). Although Barbour, somewhat inconsistently, seems to include Pythagorean tuning amongst the ones he refers to as "regular temperaments".&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, all regular temperaments and Pythagorean tuning are collectively referred to as "regular tunings".&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet ([[#CITEREFBosanquet1876|1876]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n83/mode/1up 60], [[#CITEREFBosanquet1889|1889]],  p.[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmusi00stai#page/421/mode/1up 421–2]) uses the expression "regular system" rather than "regular tuning" for the same concept.&lt;/ref&gt; Tunings and temperaments which include perfect fifths of different sizes are called "irregular".

In the [[diatonic]] scales of [[Common practice period|common practice]] Western music, any note is either separated from another by a whole number of perfect fifths, or is in the same [[pitch class]] as such a note.&lt;ref&gt;That is, it differs from such a note by a whole number of octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;
In these scales, therefore, the interval between any pair of notes can be formed  either by adding a whole number of fifths to, or subtracting them from, a whole number of [[octave]]s, or by subtracting a whole number of octaves from a whole number of fifths.  A regular tuning of such scales, therefore, can be constructed from a single [[circle of fifths|chain of fifths]],  the pitch of any note being determined by that of a single reference note and the common size of all the perfect fifths.  There are, however, some more extended scales for which the construction of regular tunings requires two or more chains of fifths offset from each other by intervals which cannot be formed from combinations of whole numbers of fifths and octaves.

A modified concept of regular tuning has been proposed by some modern musical theorists, who define it to be a general system of music intervals produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes, not necessarily including a fifth or an  octave.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;See, for example, Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]] and [[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2008|2008]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of regular temperaments are [[meantone temperament]]s and [[equal temperament]]s.

== Description and examples ==
In the chromatic scale of [[Western culture#music|western music]], the perfect fifths are the intervals between any two successive notes in the following list:

{{centre| F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,}}

or its extension to include notes with more flats or sharps.  An assignment of pitches to these notes, and others in the same pitch classes, is a regular tuning if the intervals between pairs of successive notes in the list are all the same size.  The tuning is Pythagorean if the intervals are all [[just intonation|just]]  perfect fifths, or is a regular temperament if they are tempered fifths.

Denote the size of the fifth, as a fraction of an octave, by ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the size of each fifth is 1200''f'' cents, and the frequency ratio between its end-points is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   For the fifths to qualify as tempered, ''f'' must be close, but not exactly equal,  to its just value of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3/2)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Where &amp;nbsp;{{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}&amp;nbsp;, for any positive &amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;, is the [[binary logarithm]] of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''x''}}&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/ref&gt;   To preserve the proper pitch ordering of the notes within each octave,&lt;ref&gt;Here specified using [[scientific pitch notation]], in which the subscript indicates the octave to which the note belongs, with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; being [[middle C]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{center|C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt; B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;, }}
it must also satisfy the inequalities, 4/7 &lt; ''f'' &lt; 3/5.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood ([[#CITEREFBlackwood1985|1985]], pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=0LL_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200 200–1]); Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.22]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In such a regular tuning, the common size of the intervals E–F and B–C, the [[diatonic semitone]], is 3 − 5''f'' of an octave.  The common size of the intervals between the flattened version of a note and the note itself, or between the note itself and its sharpened version, the [[chromatic semitone]], is 7''f'' − 4 of an octave.
The common size of the intervals C–D, D–E, F–G, G–A and A–B, the [[whole tone]], is the sum of the diatonic and chromatic semitones, or 2''f'' − 1 of an octave.   The diatonic semitone is larger than, smaller than, or equal to, the chromatic semitone according as ''f'' is less than, greater than,  or equal to, 7/12.  In the last case, the diatonic and chromatic semitones are both 1/12 of an octave, exactly half the size of a tone, and the tuning is [[12-tone equal temperament]].

Unless ''f'' = 7/12, as in  12-tone equal temperament, the first five notes in the list above, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, will not belong to the same [[pitch class]]es as the last five, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore not be [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] to them.  If ''f'' &gt; 7/12, each sharp is 12''f'' − 7 of an octave sharper than its otherwise enharmonically equivalent flat, whereas, if ''f'' &lt; 7/12,  it is 7 − 12''f'' of an octave flatter. On a standard [[musical  keyboard]], with only the 12 notes of the chromatic scale in each octave, only one note from each of the enharmonically alternative  pairs, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;/B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  can be assigned to any one of the appropriate black keys.   The assignments traditionally chosen were either F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, or F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/25/mode/1up 25–44]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of the intervals G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; (and of the other  [[diminished sixth]]s, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F)  is 7 − 11''f''  of an octave.  For most of  the regular temperaments used in practice in the past, these intervals were too [[consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonant]] to perform acceptably as perfect fifths, and were then referred to pejoratively as "[[wolf interval]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Donahue ([[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FTRADRMfld4C&amp;pg=PA215 215]). Sometimes also called "wolf fifths", despite their really being diminished sixths (Jorgensen [[#CITEREFJorgensen1991|1991]], p.10; Donahue, [[#CITEREFDonahue2005|2005]], p.23;  Barbour, [[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/n15/mode/1up xii]).&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular tuning is obtained by selecting the desired size of the perfect fifths &lt;ref&gt;Here taken to be measured in octaves and fractions of an octave.   Mathematically, the size of an interval in this sense is the base-2 logarithm of the frequency ratio between its end-points, or equivalently, &amp;nbsp;''s''/1200&amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp; is its size in [[cent (music)|cent]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; and constructing one or more chains of fifths, in which the upper end-point of each fifth is the same as the lower end-point of the next one in the same chain.  The scale to be tuned  comprises all the notes belonging to the same pitch classes as those at the end-points of the fifths in all the chains.  If an end-point of one of the fifths in each chain is taken as a reference, the pitches of all the notes of the scale relative to those references can be determined by travelling in either direction by a whole number of fifths along the appropriate chain, starting from its reference, and then moving up or down by a whole number of octaves.   When there is more than one chain, the pitches of the notes in one chain relative to those of another are completely determined by any single interval between any pair of notes, of which one belongs to the first chain and the other to the second.

===Examples===
If a chain of twelve fifths starts from the note A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, the notes at the ends of successive fifths in the chain will be:
{{centre| A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

If the G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;  at the end of the chain is not in the same [[pitch class]] as the A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; at its start, then extending the chain upwards will produce notes D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:-0.35em;"&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... etc., and extending it downwards will similarly produce notes D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing:-0.6em;"&gt;&amp;#x266d;&amp;#x266d;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ... etc.  The following tables give the sizes in fractions of an octave of the intervals between the note C at the start of an octave and each of the naturals, sharps and flats within the octave immediately above it when it is tuned with a regular tuning whose fifth is a fraction {{math|''f''}} of an octave.  The columns of the tables are ordered according to the sizes of the corresponding intervals.

The regular tunings given as examples below have either been  proposed or used as a means of determining the relative pitches of the notes in the above sequence.

====Notation====
:{{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3/2) }}, the size, in octaves, of a just (i.e. Pythagorean) perfect fifth, equivalent to about 702 cents.
:{{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5/4) }},  the size, in octaves, of a just major third, equivalent to about 386 cents
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} 4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[syntonic comma]], equivalent to about 21.5 cents.
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} 12 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 7 }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[pythagorean comma|ditonic (i.e. Pythagorean) comma]], equivalent to about 23.5 cents.
:{{math| ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, the size, in octaves, of a [[schisma]], equivalent to about 1.95 cents.

====12-tone equal temperament====
:When ''f'' = 7/12, as it is in the now standard 12-tone equal temperament, the total span of twelve fifths will be exactly 7 octaves, the notes G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; will belong to the same pitch classes as F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, and the diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F  will be the same size, 7/12 of an octave, as the perfect fifths.

====Other equal temperaments====
:'''a.''' When ''f'' =  ''m/n'', a [[rational numbers|rational]] [[fraction (mathematics)#Simple, common, or vulgar fractions|fraction]] of an octave, where ''m'' and ''n'' are positive integers [[Coprime integers|with no proper common factor]], then ''n'' of those fifths will span exactly ''m'' octaves, and a chain of that many fifths will generate a scale of ''n'' notes per octave, spaced equally apart at intervals of 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of an octave.   The resulting temperament is called "''n''-tone equal temperament".  If  {{math| ''m/n'' ≠ 7/12}}, the pitch class of each sharp will be ''different'' from that of its enharmonically alternative flat, and separated from it by an interval of {{math|{{!}} 12 ''m/n'' − 7 {{!}}}} of an octave.   Examples include [[17 equal temperament|17-tone]], [[19 equal temperament|19-tone]], [[22 equal temperament|22-tone]], [[31 equal temperament|31-tone]],  [[41 equal temperament|41-tone]] and  [[53 equal temperament|53-tone]] equal temperaments, with fifths of sizes 10/17, 11/19, 13/22, 18/31, 24/41 and 31/53 of an octave respectively.

:'''b.''' If a whole number, ''r'', of interleaved chains of fifths, of the same size, ''m/n'' of an octave, as above, are offset from one another by intervals of 1/(''r n'') of an octave, they will generate a scale of ''r n'' notes per octave, spaced equally apart at that same interval, thus producing an ''r n''-tone equal temperament.   Examples include [[24 equal temperament|24-tone]], [[34 equal temperament|34-tone]] and [[58 equal temperament|58-tone]] equal temperaments, each with two interleaved chains of fifths of sizes 7/12, 10/17 and 17/29 of an octave respectively, and [[72 equal temperament|72-tone]] equal temperament with 6 interleaved chains of fifths of size 7/12 of an octave.

====Pythagorean tuning and schismic temperament====
:When all the fifths are Pythagorean—that is, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{=}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—the total span of twelve fifths is larger than 7 octaves by the Pythagorean comma, which is more than a quarter of this tuning's diatonic semitone.&lt;ref&gt;And nearly a quarter of the semitone of 12-tone equal temperament.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, are flatter than the fifth by this amount, sufficient for them to qualify as wolves.

:Apart from the presence of wolves, Pythagorean tuning has the disadvantage that its normal thirds and sixths are quite dissonant.  Its  major thirds, A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–C, E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–G, B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D, F–A, C–E, G–B, D–F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A–C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  for instance, are wider than just by a syntonic comma, as are its major sixths, and its normal minor sixths and  thirds are correspondingly narrower than just by the same amount, which is too large for any of these intervals to be recognised as [[consonance and dissonance#Consonance|consonance]]s.  The diminished fourths, E–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, B–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, on the other hand, are narrower than just major thirds by only a schisma, thus making them reasonably consonant.  By extending the tuning as far as the notes G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doubleflat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; (for the chromatic scale from A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; to C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; around the spiral of fifths), or D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doubleflat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and  A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|doublesharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; (for the chromatic scale from E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; to G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt; around the spiral of fifths), each note of the chromatic scale can be made to serve as the bass for reasonably good thirds and sixths, as indicated in the following table:

:The names given in parentheses in this table are those assigned to the corresponding intervals by traditional musical terminology, where the degree assigned to an interval is determined by the number of letter-named notes included in it.

:[[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]] gave the name "[[schismatic temperament|skhismic temperament]]"&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/435/mode/1up 435]).  Now usually spelt "schismic".&lt;/ref&gt; to a Pythagorean tuning whose thirds and sixths were regarded as being  the intervals given in the above  table, rather than the ones those names would refer to in traditional musical terminology.

====Quarter-comma meantone====
:In [[quarter-comma meantone]], the size of the perfecf fifths,  &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{overset|def|{{=}}}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|4}} {{=}} {{sfrac|(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 2)|4}} }}, is chosen so that four of them span an interval of two octaves plus a just [[major third]], thus making all the major thirds and minor sixths of the resulting scale perfectly just.  The  total span of twelve of these fifths is less than 7 octaves by the so-called [[lesser diesis]], which is about 40% of an equal-temperament semitone.   The diminished sixths, B–G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;,  F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–E&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–B&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;–F, are sharper than the fifth by this amount, which is again sufficient for these intervals to qualify as wolves.   The title "quarter-comma meantone" derives from the fact that the size of the fifth in this temperament is smaller than its just value by a quarter of the syntonic comma.&lt;!--- which is the amount, 4 log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) −  log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5) − 4 of an octave, by which four just fifths exceed two octaves plus a just major third. --&gt;

====Other meantones====

:If ''q'' is a positive rational fraction, a regular temperament with fifths of size &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f''  {{overset|def|{{=}}}}  ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''q c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—that is,  a multiple ''q'' of a syntonic comma smaller than their just size of   &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;—is commonly referred to as "''q''-comma meantone".   Fractions other than 1/4 which have been suggested as possible values for ''q'' are 1/3, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10, 2/7, 2/9, 3/10 and 5/18.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour ([[#CITEREFBarbour2004|2004]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/tuningtemperamen00barb#page/31/mode/1up/search/tempered+third 31–44])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Helmholtzian temperament====
:A regular tuning with a fifth of size &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}}}}&amp;nbsp;, and with the thirds and sixths identified with the intervals specified by the scheme of [[#table2|table 2]] is called "Helmholtzian temperament".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis ([[#CITEREFEllis1885|1885]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/onsensationsofto00helmrich#page/435/mode/1up 435]).&lt;/ref&gt;   In this temperament, the major thirds and minor sixths, as given by the scheme of table 1, are perfectly just,  while the fifths and minor thirds are flatter than just, and the fourths and major sixths sharper than just, by the imperceptible amount of an eighth of a schisma.

== More recent alternative concept ==

In the traditional definition of regular tuning, it is taken for granted that the perfect fifth whose size is being fixed by the tuning is that of the diatonic major scale of common practice Western music.   A regular tuning in this sense is thus inextricably tied to the structure of that scale and others closely associated with it.  It is a much less useful concept for other styles  of music whose scales cannot be straightforwardly derived from the diatonic.&lt;ref&gt;Erlich ([[#CITEREFErlich2006|2006]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Some musical theorists have recently proposed an alternative definition of regular tuning which can be applied to a wider range of musical styles.  According to this alternative definition, a regular tuning is a collection of intervals which can be produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; For the purposes of the definition, an interval is regarded as being completely determined by just its size and direction (ascending or descending), independent of any specific range of pitches which it might span, with a descending interval being regarded as the negative of an ascending one of the same size.  Thus, the intervals between any of the pairs of notes [C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], etc., in 12-tone equal temperament, for example, are considered to be merely separate instantiations of the ''same'' interval—an ascending tempered major third of size one-third of an octave—, and the intervals between the pairs [E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [F&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], [G&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], etc., to be instantiations of its negative—a ''descending'' tempered major third of the same size.  An ascending interval in this sense can therefore be represented by a single number that specifies it size, and a descending one by the negative of the number specifying its size.

A regular tuning in this alternative sense is not required to contain octaves or perfect fifths, or to be usable for tuning any of the usual scales of common practice music, and will therefore not necessarily be obtainable as the set of intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense.  The collection of intervals that  can be produced by combining together octaves, just perfect fifths and just major thirds,&lt;ref&gt;That is, the collection of all [[5-limit tuning|5-limit intervals]].&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, although a regular tuning according to this alternative definition, cannot be the set of intervals of any tuning that is regular under the traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;Any tuning of a diatonic scale which contains both a just perfect fifth and a just major third must always contain perfect fifths of at least two different sizes. If the major third C–E is perfectly just, for example, then at least one of the fifths C–G, G–D, D–A or A–E cannot be perfectly just.&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of this article, the term "regular tuning", unless otherwise qualified, will be used in this alternative  sense.

Intervals that can be combined together to produce all the other intervals of a given regular tuning are called "generators" of the tuning. Any interval of such a tuning must have the form  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, where &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are generators for it, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are integers. The minimum number of non-zero generators needed to produce all the intervals of the tuning is called its "rank",&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20])&lt;/ref&gt; and regular tunings of rank 2 are called "linear".   The collection of ''all'' intervals obtainable by combining together the generators of a regular tuning has the mathematical structure of a [[Free abelian group#Rank|free abelian group]] of the same rank.  The theory of these groups can  therefore be useful for investigating the properties of regular tunings.

===Examples===

====The intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense====
[[Image:Rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Some examples of linear tunings generated by an octave and a perfect fifth, generally tempered (Milne et al., [[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.18]).]]
The intervals of any regular tuning in the traditional sense can be obtained by combining together its perfect fifth, a pure octave, and possibly some intervals separating chains of fifths that may be offset from one another.  That set of Intervals is therefore a regular tuning in the alternative sense.  The set of intervals of an equal temperament—in which just one size of interval is needed to produce all the others—has rank 1.  Since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning and meantone and Helmholtzian temperaments can be produced from their fifths and the octave, but not from any intervals of just one size, those sets of intervals have rank 2, and are therefore linear.

====''p''-limit tuning and just intonation====

An interval obtainable as a combination of generators whose  sizes in octaves are all of the form {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'')}}, with all {{math|''q''}}  being prime numbers no greater than some fixed prime {{math|''p''}}, is called a "[[limit (music)#Prime limit|''p''-limit interval]]", and a regular tuning is called a ''p''-limit tuning if all its intervals are ''p''-limit intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Wright ([[#CITEREFWright2009|2009]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=g4ONAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 137]).  As thus defined, a ''p''-limit tuning is automatically also a ''q''-limit tuning for any other prime ''q'' greater than&amp;nbsp;''p''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning are generated by the octave, of size one (i.e. {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}) octave, and the just perfect twelfth, of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}} octaves, they form a 3-limit tuning.  Likewise, the set of intervals generated by the octave, a just perfect twelfth, and a just major seventeenth, of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}} octaves, constitutes a 5-limit tuning.  Since this set of intervals cannot be generated by any smaller collection of generators, it is a regular tuning of rank 3.

In just intonation, the pair of notes forming every consonance has a frequency ratio whose numerator and denominator are small whole numbers.  As a consequence, these intervals must belong to a ''p''-limit tuning for some small prime {{math|''p''}}.   Thus, the intervals of Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale|syntonic diatonic scale]], for instance, in which the relative pitches of the notes are completely determined by the requirement that all  three of its  [[primary triad]]s be perfectly just [[major chord]]s, form a 5-limit tuning, since they can be generated by intervals of sizes {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}}, and {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}} octaves.

By going one step further, to proper [[7-limit tuning]]s,&lt;ref&gt;That is, to one which does in fact contain an interval of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(7)}} octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;  it is possible to obtain regular tunings with perfectly just septimal intervals.  The regular tuning generated by intervals of sizes {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3)}}, {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}, and {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(7)}} octaves, for instance, is a 7-limit tuning of rank 4 which contains perfectly just [[harmonic seventh]] intervals of size {{math| log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{frac|7|4}})}} octaves, as well as perfect fourths and fifths, and major and minor thirds and sixths which are all perfectly just.

===Temperament mappings===
By definition, a tempered interval is one which is  very nearly—but not quite—just.  Thus, if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are all either tempered or just intervals of a regular tuning, there must be some just intervals, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, such that &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; are all very close to zero.&lt;ref&gt;Or equal to zero whenever the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; happens to be perfectly just.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ,}} and {{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are all just, they must belong to a ''p''-limit tuning for some small prime ''p''.   If they are all distinct, and there is no interval which can be expressed in two or more different ways as a combination of them,&lt;ref&gt;If this is the case, the intervals &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … }}, and {{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are said to be "''independent''".&lt;/ref&gt; then the association of the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + … + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, for each ''r''-tuple, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of integers, defines a mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the ''p''-limit tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; onto the regular tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  This function, which turns out to be a useful tool for the construction of tunings with desired properties, is called a ''temperament mapping''.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
=====For the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament=====
The only just interval of 12-tone equal temperament is the octave.  Its tempered intervals are its  perfect fourth and fifth, and its major and minor third and sixth, whose sizes in octaves are {{frac|5|12}},{{frac|7|12}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|2|3}}, respectively. The corresponding just intervals can all be generated from the octave, just perfect fifth and just major third.&lt;ref&gt;The just perfect fourth can be obtained by subtracting a just perfect fifth from an octave, the just minor third by subtracting a just major third from a just perfect fifth, the just major sixth by subtracting a just perfect fifth from the sum of an octave and a just major third, and the just minor sixth by subtracting a just major third from an octave.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|7 |12}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  {{sfrac|1|3}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For a tuning generated by an octave and a fifth=====
If a regular tuning generated by an octave  and a tempered perfect fifth of size &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''}}&amp;nbsp; octaves, the sizes of its perfect fourth, major and minor thirds, and major and minor  sixths, in octaves, are   {{math|1 − ''f'' }}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|4 ''f'' − 2 }}, &amp;nbsp;{{math| 2 − 3 ''f'' }}, &amp;nbsp;{{math| 3 ''f'' − 1 }}&amp;nbsp;, and
{{math| 3 − 4 ''f'' }}, respectively.  If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|4}} }}&amp;nbsp; (quarter-comma meantone), the octave, major thirds and minor sixths are perfectly just, but all other consonances are tempered.  If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f'' {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''|3}} }}&amp;nbsp;(one-third-comma meantone), the octave, minor thirds and major sixths are perfectly just, and all other consonances are tempered.  Otherwise, all consonances except the octave are tempered.&lt;ref&gt;Or will be so far out of tune as to be no longer consonant, if &amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''}}&amp;nbsp; is sufficiently close to one of its extreme limits, {{frac|4|7}} or {{frac|3|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the temperament mapping for the intervals of this temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f'' − 2)}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For the intervals of schismic temperament=====
The just intervals of schismic temperament are its octave and perfect fourth and fifth, and its tempered intervals are its major and minor third and sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math|1 + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''  – ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, and {{math| 1 + ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of schismic temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' +  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.

=====For the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament=====
The just intervals of Helmholtzian temperament are its octave, major third and minor sixth, and its tempered intervals are its perfect fourth and fifth, and its minor third and major sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are {{math|1 + {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} − ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}, {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}}}},  {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} }}, and {{math| 1 + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} – ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament associates the 5-limit interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{math| ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} }}&amp;nbsp;, for any triple of integers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, with the interval &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' – {{sfrac|''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''|8}} ) +  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' }}&amp;nbsp;.

===Commas, rank, and relations between consonances===
The purpose of tempering consonances is to allow a greater number of them to be accommodated within the confines of a fixed scale, at the expense of compromising their purity.  In a regular tuning, this manifests itself in the existence of intervals that can be formed from two ''different'' combinations of consonances, even though their corresponding just versions are independent.

====Examples====
In 12-tone equal temperament, an interval comprising 7 octaves can also be expressed as a combination of 12 perfect fifths.  In any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth (including 12-tone equal temperament), an interval comprising 4 perfect fifths can be expressed as a combination of 2 octaves plus a major third.  In both schismic and Helmholtzian temperament an interval comprising 5 octaves can be expressed as a combination of 8 perfect fifths plus a major third.

If &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; are the temperament mappings defined above, these relations can be written as:
{{centre|{{math|0 {{=}} 12 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 7 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(12 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 7) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 4 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 2 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 4 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 2 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 2 − ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 8 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 5 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(8 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;br&gt;
0 {{=}} 8 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') + ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') − 5 ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(8 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5) {{=}} ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''c&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.}}
That is, these relations correspond to the ditonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mapping of 12-tone equal temperament, the syntonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth, and the schisma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments.

====General case====
If some interval of a regular tuning can be formed from two different combinations of its consonances, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, whose corresponding just versions are independent,&lt;ref&gt;For this to be possible, at least one of the consonances &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; must be tempered.&lt;/ref&gt; there must exist positive whole numbers, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''n&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, with &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; for any {{math|''i''}}, such that

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''n&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;.}}

Subtracting the right side of this equation from the left gives

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''c&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp;,}}

where &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0}}&amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... , ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.   Such an equation is called a ''"[[Linear function|(linear) relation]]"''.

If &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''}}&amp;nbsp; is the temperament mapping for the regular tuning, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; the just consonances such that   &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; for &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... , ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;, the above linear relation can be written as

{{center|&amp;nbsp;{{math| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 {{=}} ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''(''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''T''(''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') &lt;br&gt;
{{=}} ''T''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&amp;nbsp;.}}

Thus, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, which is a non-zero ''p''-limit interval for some small prime ''p'', is mapped to zero by the temperament mapping &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''}}&amp;nbsp;.  If all the integers &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,}}&amp;nbsp; and  &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; are reasonably small in magnitude, then because each of the intervals &amp;nbsp;{{math|''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; is equal to, or closely approximated by, the corresponding &amp;nbsp;{{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp; will be quite small.  It is referred to as a "''[[comma (music)|comma]]''".

The set of all ''p''-limit intervals &amp;nbsp;{{math|''h''}}&amp;nbsp; such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''h'') {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp; is called the "''comma lattice''" of the tuning.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et. al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2008|2008]], p.2).  These authors, however, use this term to refer not to the set of commas itself, but to the isomorphic lattice of ''t''-tuples, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ( ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' )}}&amp;nbsp;, of integers such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''T''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... +  ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''h&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} 0}}&amp;nbsp; &lt;/ref&gt;   The comma lattice of the general regular tuning described above is itself another a regular tuning  whose rank is strictly less than &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}.  It follows from one of the fundamental theorems of [[linear algebra]]&lt;ref&gt;Namely, the [[rank–nullity theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; that the rank of the regular tuning and the rank of its comma lattice must sum to &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}.

=====Examples=====
The regular tuning formed by the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament has rank 1.  Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic and ditonic commas, has rank 2.

A regular tuning generated by the octave and a tempered perfect fifth whose size in octaves is [[irrational number|irrational]] has rank 2.  Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic comma, has rank 1.

The regular tuning formed by the intervals of schismic temperament and that formed by the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament both have rank 2.  They both have the same comma lattice, generated by the schisma, of rank 1.

===Finding minimal sets of generators===
If a regular tuning has generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; that satisfy one or more linear relations, then its rank &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;, say, will be strictly less than &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.  Although there must then exist a set of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp; generators for the tuning, it may not always be possible to select these from among the unmodified generators in the original set, &amp;nbsp;{{math| { ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; }}}&amp;nbsp;.  In general, some, at least, of the intervals in a minimal set of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}&amp;nbsp; generators will have to be constructed as combinations of 2 or more of the originals.&lt;ref&gt;The intervals of 12-tone equal temperament, for instance, are generated by its perfect fifth and an octave, but not by either of those two intervals by itself. The equal temperament semitone, which does generate all the intervals of this regular tuning, is a combination of 7 equal-temperament fifths less 4 octaves.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
Consider the regular tuning generated by the octave, just perfect fifth, and a tempered major third of size {{math| ''τ'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} {{frac|18|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|46|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) }} octaves.&lt;ref&gt;This major third, comprising 5{{frac|3|5}} just perfect fourths less 2 octaves, is approximately 2.7 cents sharper than just.&lt;/ref&gt;  A temperament mapping {{math| ''T''}}&amp;nbsp; for this tuning is defined by &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''T''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ({{frac|18|5}} − {{frac|28|5}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|18|5}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − {{frac|28|5}} ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;.  The generators satisfy the relation &amp;nbsp;{{math| 0 {{=}} 18 − 28 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5 τ}}&amp;nbsp;, corresponding to the comma &amp;nbsp;{{math|  18 − 28 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − 5 ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, a 5-limit interval of size approximately 13.7 cents.  Although this regular tuning has rank 2, none of its original generators can be expressed as a combination of the other two, so no pair of them can serve as generators for it. The fifth part, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''φ'' {{overset|def|{{=}}}} {{sfrac| 1 − ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|5}}}}&amp;nbsp;,  of a just perfect fourth, however, can be written as &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''φ'' {{=}} −7 + 11 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 2 ''τ'' }}&amp;nbsp; (a combination of the original generators), and since &amp;nbsp;{{math| 1 {{=}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 5 ''φ''  }}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1 − 5 ''φ''  }}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''τ'' {{=}} −2 + 28 ''φ'' {{=}} −2 ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 18 ''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;, either the octave or the just perfect fifth together with the interval {{math| ''φ''}} constitute a pair of generators for this tuning.&lt;ref&gt;Milne et al. ([[#CITEREFMilneSetharesPlamondon2007|2007]], [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 p.20]) describe a procedure for obtaining two intervals that will generate all the intervals of a regular tuning generated by three generators satisfying a single linear relation.  When applied to this example, that procedure produces the intervals {{math| {{frac|1|5}}}} (one fifth of an octave) and &amp;nbsp;{{math|{{frac|''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|5}}}}&amp;nbsp; (one fifth of a just perfect fifth).  While these intervals can indeed be combined together to produce any interval of the tuning, neither of them can be expressed as a combination of whole numbers of copies of the original generators. So, while the tuning generated by these two intervals does include all the intervals of the original, it is a [[Subset#⊂_and_⊃_symbols|''proper'' superset]] of this latter, and not identical to it. &lt;/ref&gt;

====General Case====
Finding a minimal set of generators for a regular tuning with consonances satisfying some linear relations requires, in general, some fairly advanced, but well-known, techniques of linear algebra.  Proofs are omitted from the following outline.&lt;ref&gt;Which is a slightly more detailed version of that given by Newman ([[#CITEREFNewma1997|1997]], pp.376–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; of a regular tuning satisfy the linear relations:
{{center|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{11} g_1 + a_{12} g_2 + \dots + a_{1t} g_t\\
0  &amp;\ =\ a_{21} g_1 + a_{22} g_2 + \dots + a_{2t} g_t\\

and no others apart from linear combinations of these, then the rank, {{math|''c''}}, say, of the tuning's comma lattice is the rank of the {{math|''s'' × ''t''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; whose entries are the integers &amp;nbsp;{{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and the rank of the tuning itself is &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;If the relations are independent, then &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; will be of [[full rank]], and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''c'' {{=}} ''s'' &lt; ''t''}}&amp;nbsp;.  If desired, the elimination of redundant relations can reduce the problem to this case.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let &amp;nbsp;{{math|''S''}}&amp;nbsp; be the [[Smith normal form]] of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; be &amp;nbsp;{{math|''s'' × ''s''}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' × ''t''}}&amp;nbsp; [[unimodular matrix|unimodular matrices]]&lt;ref&gt;A matrix is unimodular when it is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] and both its own entries and those of its inverse are integers.  The Smith normal form and unimodular matrices &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; relating it to the original matix always exist for matrices having integer entries.  The matrix  {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} will be unique if the original matrix has full rank, but not otherwise. The matrix  {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} will not be unique.&lt;/ref&gt; such that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''S'' {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''A U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''W''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math| (''t'' − ''c'') × ''t''}}&amp;nbsp; submatrix of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; comprising its last &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; rows, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''V''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' × (''t'' − ''c'')}}&amp;nbsp; submatrix of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; comprising its last &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; columns,  &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''}}&amp;nbsp; be the &amp;nbsp;{{math|''t'' × 1}}&amp;nbsp; column vector whose entries are &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;, and let &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''w'' {{=}} ''W g''}}&amp;nbsp;.

Since the entries of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''W''}}&amp;nbsp; are integers, the entries, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''t''– ''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''w''}}&amp;nbsp; are intervals in the tuning generated by &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  But since the entries of &amp;nbsp;{{math|''V''}}&amp;nbsp; are also integers, and  &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''g'' {{=}} ''V w''}}&amp;nbsp;, it follows that &amp;nbsp;{{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''t''– ''c''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; constitute a minimal set of &amp;nbsp;{{math| ''t'' − ''c''}}&amp;nbsp; generators for the tuning.

Postmultiplying &amp;nbsp;{{tmath| A }}&amp;nbsp; by either of the two unimodular matrices,

The inverses of these unimodular matrices are:

{{centre|
{{tmath| \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp;  -28 &amp; -5 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -7 &amp; 11 &amp; 2  \end{matrix}\right)  }}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{tmath| \left(\begin{matrix} 18 &amp;  -28 &amp; -5 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ -7 &amp; 11 &amp; 2  \end{matrix}\right)  }}&amp;nbsp;, respectively. }}

Applied to the original generators, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; }}&amp;nbsp;, and &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, the first of these produces the pair of generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|−7 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  + 11 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, while the second produces the pair &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;{{math|−7 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  + 11 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.


'''b. (Miracle temperament)'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Consider the regular tuning generated by the octave,&amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, temperered perfect fifth, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, of size

{{center|{{math|  {{frac|17|19}} − {{frac|4|19}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{frac|2|19}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{frac|17|19}} − {{frac|4|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) + {{frac|2|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp;octaves}} and
{{center|{{math|  −{{frac|4|19}} + {{frac|30|19}} ''f&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' − {{frac|15|19}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} −{{frac|4|19}} + {{frac|30|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) − {{frac|15|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp; octaves,}} respectively.  These last two intervals are tempered 2.3 cents  and 0.6 cents flatter than a just [[septimal minor seventh]] and a just [[tritone#Eleventh harmonic|undecimal semi-augmented fourth]], with freqency ratios {{math|{{frac|7|4}}}} and {{math|{{frac|11|8}}}}, respectively.

The generators &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; satisfy the set of relations
{{centre|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0 &amp;\ =\ 3 g_1  - g_2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ - 3 g_4 \\
0 &amp;\ =\ g_1\ \ + g_2\ \ - g_3\   - g_4  - g_5 \\
0 &amp;\ =\ g_1\ - 2 g_2  - 2 g_3  + g_4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;, }}
which has matrix
{{center|{{tmath| A {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\
                                      1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
                                      1 &amp; -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;}}
Postmultiplying &amp;nbsp;{{math|''A''}}&amp;nbsp; by the unimodular matrix
{{center|{{tmath| U {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                                      -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\
                                      1 &amp; 0 &amp;  3 &amp; 1 &amp; -7 \\
                                      1 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\
                                      -2 &amp; -1 &amp;  -7 &amp; -1 &amp; 15 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;}}
reduces it to Smith normal form:
{{center|{{tmath| A\,U {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                      0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                      0 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;.}}
From this it follows that the tuning has rank 2, and its comma lattice rank 3.  The last two rows of the inverse of &amp;nbsp;{{tmath|U}}&amp;nbsp;,

{{center|{{tmath| U^{-1} {{=}} \left(\begin{matrix} 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\

                                                    1 &amp; -2 &amp;  -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
                                                    1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                                           1 &amp; -1 &amp;  -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right) }}&amp;nbsp;,}}
                                           
give the octave, &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, and the interval &amp;nbsp;{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  {{overset|''def''|{{=}}}} ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{frac|1|19}} + {{frac|2|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(3) −  {{frac|1|19}} log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(5)}}&amp;nbsp;octaves as a minimal set of two generators for the tuning.  This last interval is called a "secor", after [[George Secor]], who discovered it, and the regular tuning just described is called "miracle temperament".&lt;ref&gt;Secor ([[#CITEREFSecor1975|1975]], [[#CITEREFSecor1976|1976]], [[#CITEREFSecor2006|2006]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The tuning's tempered fifth comprises 6 secors, and its tempered major third one octave minus 7 secors.   Its minor sixth is thus tempered to 7 secors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">The '''SAT Subject Test in Physics''', '''Physics SAT II''', or simply the '''Physics SAT''', is a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] on [[physics]] administered by [[The College Board]] in the United States. A high school student generally chooses to take the test to fulfill [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools at which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''; they are still well known by this name.

The material tested on the Physics SAT is supposed to be equivalent to that taught in a junior- or senior-level high school physics class. It requires critical thinking and test-taking strategies, at which high school freshmen or sophomores may be inexperienced. The Physics SAT tests more than what normal state requirements are; therefore, many students prepare for the Physics SAT using a [[prep book|preparatory book]] or by taking an [[AP course]] in [[Physics]].

==Format==

The SAT Subject Test in Physics has 75 questions and consists of two parts: Part A and Part B.

'''Part A:''' 
*  First 12 or 13 questions
*  4 groups of two to four questions each
*  The questions within any one group all relate to a single situation.
*  Five possible answer choices are given before the question.
*  An answer choice can be used once, more than once, or not at all in each group.

'''Part B:'''
*  Last 62 or 63 questions
*  Each question has five possible answer choice with one correct answer.
*  Some questions may be in groups of two or three.

==Scoring==

The test has 75 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This score is then converted to a scaled score of 200–800. The mean score for the 2006–07 test administrations was 643 with a [[standard deviation]] of 107. Sample percentile ranks for the 2008&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat_subject_tests_percentile_ranks_2008.pdf SAT Subject Tests Percentile Ranks]&lt;/ref&gt; administrations are available from the College Board.

==Preparation==
The College Board's recommended preparation is a one-year college preparatory course in physics, a one-year course in [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]], and experience in the laboratory.

==Resources==
Students taking the SAT Subject Test in Physics are prohibited from using any resources during the test, including textbooks, notes, or formula sheets. Although there are mathematics questions including trigonometry, the use of a calculator is not allowed. All scratch work must be done directly in the test booklet.

'''Sketchpad''' (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) was a revolutionary computer program written by [[Ivan Sutherland]] in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the [[Turing Award]] in 1988, and the [[Kyoto Prize]] in 2012.  It pioneered the way for [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI).&lt;ref name="SearsJacko2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Andrew|last2=Jacko|first2=Julie A.|title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies and Emerging Applications, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8TPF_O385AC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=19 September 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4106-1586-2|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of [[computer graphics]] in general. For example, the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) was derived from the Sketchpad as well as modern [[object oriented programming]]. Ivan Sutherland demonstrated with it that computer graphics could be used for both [[computer art|artistic]] and [[Computer-aided design|technical]] purposes in addition to showing a novel method of [[human-computer interaction]].

== History ==
Sutherland was inspired by the [[Memex]] from "[[As We May Think]]" by [[Vannevar Bush]]. Sketchpad inspired [[Douglas Engelbart]] to design and develop [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] at the [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC) at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) during the 1960s.

== Software ==

Sketchpad was the first program ever to utilize a complete [[graphical user interface]].

The clever way the program organized its [[Geometry|geometric]] data pioneered the use of "master" ("objects") and "occurrences" ("instances") in computing and pointed forward to [[object oriented programming]]. The main idea was to have master drawings which one could instantiate into many duplicates. If the user changed the master drawing, all the instances would change as well.

Geometric '''constraints''' is another major invention in Sketchpad was that it let the user easily constrain geometric properties in the drawing&amp;mdash;for instance, the length of a line or the angle between two lines could be fixed.

As a trade magazine said, clearly Sutherland "broke new ground in 3D computer modeling and visual simulation, the basis for computer graphics and CAD/CAM".&lt;ref name=Penton&gt;{{cite news|url=http://americanmachinist.com/cadcam-software/cadcam-hall-fame|title=The CAD/CAM Hall of Fame|work=American Machinist|publisher=Penton Media|date=November 1, 1998|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few programs can be called precedents for his achievements. [[Patrick J. Hanratty]] is sometimes called the "father of CAD/CAM"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patrick Hanratty spotlight|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/spotlight/spotlight_hanratty.php|date=October 18, 2012|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote PRONTO, a [[numerical control]] language at [[General Electric]] in 1957, and wrote CAD software while working for [[General Motors]] beginning in 1961. Sutherland wrote in his thesis that [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] had a "similar program"&lt;ref name=IES-thesis&gt;{{cite web | last=Sutherland | first=Ivan Edward | title=Sketchpad: A man-machine graphical communication system (courtesy Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge UCAM-CL-TR-574 September 2003) | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date=January 1963 | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.html | accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[T-Square (software)|T-Square]] was developed by [[Peter Samson]] and one or more fellow MIT students in 1962, both for the [[PDP-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Computer History Museum | title=The Mouse that Roared: PDP-1 Celebration Event (Running Time: 01:53:46)| date= 15 May 2006| url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/moving-image/DEC/PDP-1_Online/dec.the_mouse_that_roared_pdp_1_celebration_event.lecture.2006.102654189.wmv | accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
Sketchpad ran on the [[Lincoln TX-2]] (1958) computer at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], which had 64k of 36-bit words. The user drew on the screen with the recently invented [[light pen]]. Of the 36 bits available to store each display spot in the display file, 20 gave the coordinates of that spot for the display system and the remaining 16 gave the address of the n-component element responsible for adding that spot to display.

In 1963 most computers ran jobs in [[batch job]] mode only, using [[punched card]]s or [[magnetic tape]] reels submitted by professional programmers or [[engineering]] students.  A considerable amount of work was required to make the TX-2 operate in interactive mode with a large [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen.  When Sutherland had finished with it, it had to be reconverted to run in batch mode again.

== Publications ==
The Sketchpad program was part and parcel of Sutherland's [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis at [[MIT]] and peripherally related to the [http://images.designworldonline.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CADhistory/8436-TM-4.pdf Computer-Aided Design project] at that time.

[[File:South-pointing chariot (Science Museum model).jpg|thumb|Exhibit in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London, England. This conjectural model chariot incorporates a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear.]]
{{Chinese|pic=|picsize=|piccap=|t=指南車|s=指南车|p=zhǐ nán chē|j=zi2 naam4 gui1|y=jí nàahm guī}}

The '''south-pointing chariot''' (or '''carriage''') was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the [[south]], no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, the pointer took the form of a [[doll]] or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was supposedly used as a [[compass]] for [[navigation]] and may also have had other purposes.

The ancient Chinese invented a mobile-like armored cart used in from the 5th century BC called the [[Dongwu Che]] ({{zh|c=洞屋车}}). It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield. The Chinese war wagon was designed as a kind of mobile protective cart with a shed-like roof. It would serve to be rolled up to city fortifications to provide protection for [[sappers]] digging underneath to weaken a wall's foundation. The early Chinese war wagon became the basis of technologies for the making of ancient Chinese south-pointing chariots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fighting Techniques of the Oriental World 1200-1860 |last=Haskew |first= Michael E |last2=Jorgensen |first2= Christer |last3=McNab |first3= Chris |last4=Niderost |first4= Eric |publisher=Metro Books |year=2008 |isbn= 978-1905704965 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology |last=Lu |first=	Yongxiang |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-3662441626 |volume=3 |publication-date=October 20, 2014 |page=516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of earlier south-pointing chariots, but the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200&amp;ndash;265 CE) of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. No ancient chariots still exist, but many extant ancient Chinese texts mention them, saying they were used intermittently until about 1300 CE. Some include information about their inner components and workings.

There were probably several types of south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In most or all of them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a [[gear]]ed mechanism to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand at the start of a journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional [[dead reckoning]], which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears. If so, it was probably the first use of differentials anywhere in the world.

The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, wheeled vehicle used to discern the southern cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary [[Fu Xuan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 40"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the ''[[Weilüe]]'', written by the East Han Dynasty politician [[Yuan Huan]] also described the south-pointing chariot of belonging to the Chinese mechanical engineer and politician [[Ma Jun]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; The [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265&amp;ndash;420 CE) era text of the ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern [[gatehouse]] of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; However, the later written ''[[Book of Song|Song Shu]]'' (''Book of Song'') (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as creating the background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]] (1050&amp;ndash;771 BCE). The book also provided a description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text, translated by the British scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham]], reads as follows (the south-pointing chariot is referred to as the south-pointing carriage):

{{cquote|The south-pointing carriage was first constructed by the Duke of Zhou (beginning of the 1st millennium [[Before Common Era|BC]]) as a means of conducting homewards certain envoys who had arrived from a great distance beyond the frontiers. The country to be traversed was a boundless plain, in which people lost their bearings as to east and west, so (the Duke) caused this vehicle to be made in order that the ambassadors should be able to distinguish north and south. The ''Gui Gu Zi'' book says that the people of the [[Zheng (state)|State of Zheng]], when collecting jade, always carried with them a 'south-pointer', and by means of this were never in doubt (as to their position). During the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] dynasties, however, nothing more was heard of the vehicle. In the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]] period, [[Zhang Heng]] re-invented it, but owing to the confusion and turmoil at the close of the dynasty it was not preserved.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|In the State of Wei, (in the [[Three Kingdoms|San Guo]] period) Gaotong Long and Qin Lang were both famous scholars; they disputed about the south-pointing carriage before the court, saying that there was no such thing, and that the story was nonsense. But during the Qing-long reign period (233&amp;ndash;237 AD) the emperor Ming Di commissioned the scholar Ma Jun to construct one, and he duly succeeded. This again was lost during the troubles attending the establishment of the [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286&amp;ndash;287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|Later on, [[Shi Hu]] (emperor of the [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] [[Later Zhao]] Dynasty) had one made by Xie Fei, and again Linghu Sheng made one for Yao Xing (emperor of the [[Later Qin]] dynasty). The latter was obtained by emperor An Di of the Jin in the 13th year of the Yi-xi reign-period (417 AD), and it finally came into the hands of emperor [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Wu Di]] of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] when he took over the administration of [[Chang'an]]. Its appearance and construction was like that of a drum-carriage ([[odometer]]). A wooden figure of a man was placed at the top, with its arm raised and pointing to the south, (and the mechanism was arranged in such a way that) although the carriage turned round and round, the pointer-arm still indicated the south. In State processions, the south-pointing carriage led the way, accompanied by the imperial guard.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|These vehicles, constructed as they had been by barbarian ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) workmen, did not function particularly well. Though called south-pointing carriages, they very often did not point true, and had to negotiate curves step by step, with the help of someone inside to adjust the machinery. The ingenious man from [[Fanyang]], Zi [[Zu Chongzhi]] frequently said, therefore, that a new (and properly automatic) south-pointing carriage ought to be constructed. So towards the close of the Sheng-Ming reign period (477&amp;ndash;479 AD) the emperor [[Emperor Shun of Liu Song|Shun Di]], during the premiership of the Prince of Qi, commissioned (Zi Zu Chongzhi) to make one, and when it was completed it was tested by Wang Seng-qian, military governor of Tanyang, and Liu Hsiu, president of the Board of Censors. The workmanship was excellent, and although the carriage was twisted and turned in a hundred directions, the hand never failed to point to the south. Under the Jin, moreover, there had also been a south-pointing ship.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"/&gt;}}

The last sentence of the passage is of great interest for navigation at sea, since the magnetic [[compass]] used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095). Although the ''Song Shu'' text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287&amp;ndash;288.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the ''Gu Jin Zhu'' book of [[Cui Bao]] (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 288&lt;/ref&gt; Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the ''Shang Fang Gu Shi'' (''Traditions of the Imperial Workshops''), but the book was lost by his time.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"/&gt;

[[File:The Chinese-children instruction vehicle of Expo 2005 Aichi Japan.jpg|Children's instructive toy chariot in Chinese display at [[Expo 2005]] in Japan|thumb]]

===Japan===
The invention of the south-pointing chariot also made its way to [[Japan]] by the 7th century. The ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (The Chronicles of Japan) of 720 CE described the earlier Chinese [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s [[Zhi Yu]] and [[Zhi You]] constructing several south-pointing Chariots for [[Emperor Tenji]] of Japan in 658 CE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by several more chariot devices built in 666 CE as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"/&gt;

===''Song Shi''===

The south-pointing chariot was also combined with the earlier Han Dynasty era invention of the [[odometer]] (also [[Greco-Roman]]), a mechanical device used to measure distance traveled, and found in all modern [[automobile]]s. It was mentioned in the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279 CE) historical text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345) that the engineers [[Yan Su]] (in 1027 CE) and [[Wu Deren]] (in 1107 CE) both created south-pointing chariots, which it details as follows.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; (In Needham's translation, inches and feet (ft) are used as units of distance. 1 inch is 25.4 millimetres. 1&amp;nbsp;ft is 12 inches or 304.8&amp;nbsp;mm.)

{{cquote|In the 5th year of the Tian-Sheng reign period of the [[Emperor Renzong of Song|emperor Renzong]] (1027 AD), Yan Su, a Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, made a south-pointing carriage. He memorialised the throne, saying, [after the usual historical introduction]: 'Throughout the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dynasties]] and until the reigning dynasty there has been, so far as I know, no one who has been able to construct such a vehicle. But now I have invented a design myself and have succeeded in completing it'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|'The method involves using a carriage with a single pole (for two horses). Above the outside framework of the body of the carriage let there be a cover in two stories.

After this initial description of Yan Su's device, the text continues to describe the work of Wu Deren, who crafted a wheeled device that would combine the odometer and south-pointing chariot:

{{cquote|It was ordered that the method should be handed down to the (appropriate) officials so that the machine might be made. In the first year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107 AD), the Chamberlain Wu Deren presented specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the carriage with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|The body of the south-pointing carriage was 11.15 ft. (long), 9.5 ft. wide, and 10.9 ft. deep.

Above there stood a figure of a ''xian'' holding a rod, on the left and right were tortoises and cranes, one each on either side, and four figures of boys each holding a tassel. In the upper story there were at the four corners [[trip-mechanism]]s, and also 13 horizontal wheels, each 1.85 ft. in diameter, 5.55 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth at intervals of 1.8 inches apart.

== Chariots with differential gears ==

===Background and explanation===
[[File:Transmission diagram.JPG|thumb|An illustration of a differential between the drive shaft (at bottom right) and driving wheels of an automobile]]

There is a widely believed hypothesis that most, if not all, south-pointing chariots worked by means of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} A differential is an assembly of gears, nowadays used in almost all automobiles except some electric and hybrid-electric ones, which has three shafts linking it to the external world. They are conveniently labelled A, B, and C. The gears cause the rotation speed of Shaft A to be proportional to the ''sum'' of the rotation speeds of Shafts B and C. There are no other limitations on the rotation speeds of the shafts.

In an automobile, Shaft A is connected to the engine (through the transmission), and Shafts B and C are connected to two road wheels, one on each side of the vehicle. When the vehicle turns, the wheel going around the outside of the turning curve has to roll further and rotate faster than the wheel on the inside. The differential permits this to happen while both wheels are being driven by the engine. If the sum of the speeds of the wheels is constant, the speed of the engine does not change.

In a south-pointing chariot, according to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected ''through a direction-reversing gear'' to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional to the ''difference'' between the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.

The hypothesis that there were south-pointing chariots with differential gears originated in the 20th century. People who were familiar with modern (e.g. automotive) uses of differentials interpreted some of the ancient Chinese descriptions in ways that agreed with their own ideas. Essentially, they re-invented the south-pointing chariot, as it had previously been re-invented several times in antiquity. Working chariots that use differentials have been constructed in recent decades. Whether any such chariots existed previously is not known with certainty.

Although the [[Antikythera mechanism#Investigations and reconstructions|Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to have used differential gears, the first true differential gear definitely known to have been used was by Joseph Williamson in 1720.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; He used a differential for correcting the [[equation of time]] for a [[clock]] that displayed both [[Local mean time|mean]] and [[solar time]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298" /&gt;

=== Geometrical properties ===
If the south-pointing chariot were built perfectly accurately, using a differential gear, and if it travelled on an Earth that was perfectly smooth, it would have interesting properties. It would be a mechanical compass that transports a direction, given by the pointer, along the path it travels. Mathematically the device performs [[parallel transport]] along the path it travels.

The chariot can be used to detect straight lines or [[geodesics]]. A path on a surface the chariot travels along is a geodesic if and only if the pointer does not rotate with respect to the base of the chariot.

Because of the [[curvature]] of the Earth's surface (due to it being curved around as a globe), the chariot would generally not continue to point due south as it moves. For example, if the chariot moves along a geodesic (as approximated by any [[great circle]]) the pointer should instead stay at a fixed angle to the path. Also, if two chariots travel by different routes between the same starting and finishing points, their pointers, which were aimed in the same direction at the start, usually do not point in the same direction at the finish. Likewise, if a chariot goes around a closed loop, starting and finishing at the same point on the Earth's surface, its pointer generally does not aim in the same direction at the finish as it did at the start. The difference is the [[holonomy]] of the path, and is proportional to the enclosed area. If the journeys are short compared with the radius of the Earth, these discrepancies are small and may have no practical importance. Nevertheless, they show that this type of chariot, based on differential gears, would be an imperfect compass even if constructed exactly and used in ideal conditions.

=== Lack of precision, and implications ===
Real machines are never built perfectly accurately. Simple geometry shows that if the chariot's mechanism is based on a differential gear and if, for example, the width of the track of the chariot (the separation between its wheels) is three metres, and if the wheels are intended to be identical but actually differ in diameter by one part in a thousand, then if the chariot travels one kilometre in a straight line, the "south-pointing" figure will rotate nearly twenty degrees. If it initially points exactly to the south, at the end of the one-kilometre trip it will point almost to the [[Cardinal direction|south-southeast]] or [[Boxing the compass|south-southwest]], depending on which wheel is the larger. If the chariot travels nine kilometres, the figure will end up pointing almost due north. Obviously, this would make it useless as a south-pointing compass. To be a useful navigational tool, the figure would have to rotate no more than a couple of degrees over a journey of a hundred kilometres, but this would require the chariot's wheels to be equal in diameter to within one part in a million. Even if the process of manufacturing the wheels were capable of this precision (which would not be possible with ancient Chinese methods), it is doubtful that the equality of the wheels could be maintained for long as they are subjected to the wear and tear of travelling across open country. Irregularity of the ground would add further errors to the device's functioning.

Considerable scepticism is therefore warranted as to whether this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed to the body of the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.

If the real purposes of the chariot and the accounts of it were amusement and impressing visiting foreigners, rather than actual long-distance navigation, then its inaccuracy might not have been important.  Considering that a large mechanical wagon or chariot would be obligated to travel on roads, the destination in question would typically not be in an unknown direction.   The fact that the sources cited above mention that the chariot was placed at the front of processions, its high level of mechanical complexity and fragility, and that it was 'reinvented' several times contribute to the conclusion that it was not used for navigation, as a truly practical and useful navigational tool would not be forgotten or left unused.

== Chariots without differential gears ==

Although the hypothesis that the south-pointing chariot used differential gears has gained wide acceptance, it should be recognized that functional south-pointing chariots without differential gears are possible. The ancient descriptions are often unclear, but they suggest that the Chinese implemented several different designs, at least some of which did not include differentials.

=== Mechanical designs ===

Some of the ancient descriptions suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might have been used to fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was on the outside of the curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.

The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren appear to have used this type of mechanism. (See descriptions quoted from the ''Song Shi'', above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an [[odometer]], there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned the space between the uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.

The description does not mention a third road wheel to fix the turning radius, but it is possible that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was an important part of the mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.

If a third road wheel was included, this type of south-pointing chariot could have worked quite accurately as a compass when used for short journeys under good conditions, but if used for long journeys it would have been subject to cumulative errors, like chariots using the differential mechanism.

If in fact there was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so that one of the two wheels was stationary and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A [[brake]] would have helped, but there is no mention of one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.

The ''Song Shi'' description of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. The gear ratios would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled the diameter of the road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels. The gear ratios were appropriate for these dimensions.

The charioteer would have had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the pointing doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He would have been able to adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot ''appear to'' work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.

Other mechanical designs for the south-pointing chariot are also possible, including ones that employ a device that is used today, the [[gyrocompass]]. However, there is no indication that the ancient Chinese knew of these.

=== Non-mechanical possibilities ===

Some south-pointing chariots may not have been purely mechanical devices. Someone riding inside the chariot may have used some non-mechanical method of determining the compass directions, and turned the doll on top of the chariot accordingly. There are several methods that could have been used, for example:

* By using a [[Compass#Magnetic compass|magnetic compass]]. The Chinese were using this for navigation by the 11th century CE, when south-pointing chariots were still being made and used.
* By using astronomical observations of the Sun and/or stars, e.g. the [[Pole Star]]. [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomical knowledge]] was extensive.
* By using local knowledge. The person in the chariot may have known the area or had a map or description of it.
* By observing the polarization of light from the sky. Vikings used [[birefringent]] crystals of [[Iceland spar]] to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method at about the same time.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible.
* By observing light that had been refracted by the Earth's atmosphere. This is one of the techniques that were used by Polynesian navigators to steer ships among Pacific islands. When the surface of the Earth, ocean or ground, is colder than the air above it, a dense layer of air is formed near the surface, which refracts light downward. The result is that light can go around the curvature of the Earth, allowing things to be seen at much greater distances than simple geometry would predict. The images are very distorted, but they can be recognized by skilled navigators. Certain other Polynesian techniques can also be used on land and may have been employed by the Chinese.

Unlike mechanisms that rely on the rotation of road wheels, most of these methods can be used at sea. This may account for the mention (see "Earliest sources" above) that a marine version of the south-pointing chariot existed.

These methods can work accurately over long distances, unlike the mechanical designs for the chariot.

==Necessity of non-mechanical orientation==
[[File:South-pointing chariot, China Court, Ibn Battuta Mall, Dubai.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A wooden two-wheeled cart supporting a series of wooden peg gears and a metal statue pointing with one outstretched hand.|South-pointing chariot replica at the [[Ibn Battuta Mall]], Dubai]]

Some non-mechanical method of finding the south must have been used when a mechanical south-pointing chariot was [[wiktionary:initialize|initialized]], aiming its pointer to the south at the start of a journey. Any of the methods mentioned above in "Non-mechanical possibilities" could have been used.

If any south-pointing chariot was really used for long-distance navigation, it must have relied (after initialization) on a non-mechanical direction-finding method. It might have been operated non-mechanically by someone riding in it, as outlined above. Alternatively, if it had a mechanical mechanism, it must have been frequently re-initialized non-mechanically to eliminate accumulated errors and uncertainties.

The only chariots that might not have needed non-mechanical methods of finding the south would have been those that were never used for long-distance navigation. If some chariots were used only for amusement or fraud, they could have worked purely mechanically. Even initialization could have been avoided by simply declaring some arbitrary direction to be "south".

== Where they can be seen ==
While none of the historic south-pointing chariots remain, full sized replicas can be found.

The History Museum in [[Beijing]], [[China]], holds a replica based on the mechanism of Yen Su (1027).
The [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], holds a replica based on the Lanchester mechanism of 1932.

Referred to as the "southern pointing man", two replicas can also be seen (and physically experimented with) at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Canada.

[[File:Fern-frond-sori.jpg|thumb|right|The sporophyll of a fern. It is a fertile leaf bearing reproductive structures.]]
A '''sporophyll''' is a [[leaf]] that bears [[sporangia]]. Both microphylls and megaphylls can be sporophylls. In heterosporous plants, sporophylls (whether they are microphylls or megaphylls) bear either megasporangia and thus are called '''megasporophylls''', or microsporangia and are called '''microsporophylls'''. The overlap of the prefixes and roots makes these terms a particularly confusing subset of botanical nomenclature.

Sporophylls vary greatly in appearance and structure, and may or may not look similar to sterile leaves. Plants that produce sporophylls include:

''[[Alaria esculenta]]'' a brown alga shows sporophylls attached near the base of the alga.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Carola I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds''. The Kew Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lycophyte]]s, where sporophylls may be aggregated into [[strobilus|strobili]] (''Selaginella'' and some ''Lycopodium'' and related genera) or distributed singly among sterile leaves (''[[Huperzia]]''). Sporangia are borne in the axil or on the adaxial surface of the sporophyll. In heterosporous members, megasporophylls and microsporophylls may be intermixed or separated in a variety of patterns.

[[Fern]]s, which may produce sporophylls that are similar to sterile fronds or that appear very different from sterile fronds. These may be non-photosynthetic and lack typical pinnae (e.g. ''Onoclea'')

[[Cycad]]s produce strobili, both pollen-producing and seed-producing, that are composed of sporophylls. 

''[[Ginkgo]]'' produces microsporophylls aggregated into a pollen strobilus. Ovules are not born on sporophylls {{Citation needed|reason=the structure that carries the seed and arillus of Ginko can and has been interpreted as a leave (This means that Ovules are in Ginko born on megasphorophylls), why should this be wrong now?|date=October 2017}}.

Conifers, like ''Ginkgo'' and cycads, produce microsporophylls, aggregated into pollen strobili. However, unlike these other groups, ovules are produced on cone scales, which are modified shoots rather than sporophylls.

Some plants do not produce sporophylls. Sporangia are produced directly on stems. ''Psilotum'' has been interpreted as producing sporangia (fused in a synangium) on the terminus of a stem. ''[[Equisetum]]'' always produce strobili, but the structures bearing sporangia (sporangiophores) have been interpreted as [[Aerial stem modification|modified stems]]. The sporangia, despite being recurved are interpreted as terminal. 

[[Gnetophyte]]s produce both compound pollen and seed strobili.

[[File:Eton College (2) - August 5, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Eton College]] in England has educated nineteen [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Ministers]].]]
'''The Establishment''' generally denotes a dominant group or [[elite]] that holds [[Power (social and political)|power]] or authority in a nation or organisation. The Establishment may be a closed social group which selects its own members or specific entrenched elite structures, either in government or in specific institutions.

The [[American Sociological Association]] states that the term is often used by those protesting a small group that dominates a larger organization.  For example, in 1968, a group of academics set up the "Sociology Liberation Movement" to repudiate the leadership of the American Sociological Association, which they referred to as the "Establishment in American sociology".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Barcan, ''Sociological theory and educational reality'' (1993) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, any relatively small class or group of people having control can be referred to as ''The Establishment''; and conversely, in the jargon of [[sociology]], anyone who does not belong to ''The Establishment'' may be labelled an "outsider".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Norbert |last1=Elias |authorlink1=Norbert Elias |first2=John L |last2=Scotson |title=The Established and the Outsiders |year=1965 |oclc=655412048}}{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Norbert |last1=Elias |authorlink1=Norbert Elias |first2=Herminio |last2=Martins |first3=Richard |last3=Whitley |title=Scientific Establishments and Hierarchies |year=1982 |publisher=Reidel |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-90-277-1322-3}}{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[anti-authoritarianism|Anti-authoritarian]] and [[antiestablishmentarianism|anti-establishment]] ideologies tend to view establishments as illegitimate.

==United Kingdom==
The term is most often used in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In different contexts it may include leading politicians, senior [[civil servant]]s, senior barristers and judges, aristocrats, [[Oxbridge]] academics, senior clergy in the established [[Church of England]], the most important financiers and industrialists, governors of the [[BBC]], and the members of and top aides to the [[British Royal Family|royal family]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The term in this sense is sometimes mistakenly believed to have been coined by the British journalist [[Henry Fairlie]], who in September 1955 in the London magazine ''[[The Spectator]]'' defined that network of prominent, well-connected people as "the Establishment", explaining:

{{quote|By ''the Establishment'', I do not only mean the centres of official power—though they are certainly part of it—but rather the whole matrix of official and social relations within which power is exercised. The exercise of power in the United Kingdom (more specifically, in England) cannot be understood unless it is recognized that it is exercised socially.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Fairlie|Fairlie, Henry]], "Political Commentary", ''[[The Spectator]]'', 23 September 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following that, the term ''the Establishment'' was quickly picked up in newspapers and magazines all over London, making Fairlie famous. However, the term had been used by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] in a similar fashion, a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Henry Fairlie |last1=Fairlie |first1=Henry |title=Evolution of a Term |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1968/10/19/1968_10_19_173_TNY_CARDS_000293928 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=19 October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] would cite Fairlie's column as its  ''locus classicus''.

However, author and professor [[Carroll Quigley]] of [[Georgetown University]], in his book ''The Anglo-American Establishment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carrollquigley.net/pdf/The_Anglo-American_Establishment.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Anglo-American Establishment |publisher=Carrollquigley.net |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden''. 1981, New York: Books in Focus, 354 pages, {{ISBN|0-916728-50-1}} (hardcover and paperback). Reprinted by Rancho Palos Verdes: GSG &amp; Associates, date unknown, {{ISBN|0-945001-01-0}} (paperback). Full text.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term much more specifically than did [[Fairlie]]. In that book (copyright date 1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0945001010 |title=Anglo-American Establishment (9780945001010): Quigley Carroll: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to an out-of-print edition):

{{quote|Quigley exposes the secret society's (sic) established in London in 1891, by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Quigley explains how these men worked in union to begin their society to control the world. He explains how all the wars from that time were deliberately created to control the economies of all the nations.}}

That society was established by Cecil Rhodes in 1891 and, following Rhodes' death in 1902, was carried on by [[Alfred Milner]], which society, Quigley refers to as the ''Milner Group'', but sometimes referred to as the [[Round Table movement]]. That group, with significant American input, would, following the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], establish and control the Royal Institute for International Affairs, later to become known as [[Chatham House]].

Much more generally, this use of the word, ''Establishment'', may have been influenced by the British term, ''[[established church]]'', for the official [[Church of England]]. The term was then found useful in discussing the power elites in many other countries. The [[English language|English]] word is now used as a [[loanword]] in many other languages.

== Australia ==
The term, ''establishment'' is often used in Australia to refer both to the main political parties and also to the powers behind those parties. In the book, ''Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis'' by Amir Abedi (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Anti_political_Establishment_Parties.html?id=B8oPfqRUqOYC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis - Amir Abedi - Google Buku |publisher=Books.google.co.id |date= |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Abedi refers to the Labor Party and the Coalition Parties (the Liberal Party and the National/Country Party) as the establishment parties. It is communally thought{{By whom|date=August 2014}} that the Coalition parties are more closely aligned to the American and particularly the British political ''establishment'' than is the Labor Party. This would seem to be borne out by the fact that many more former members of the Coalition parties have been honoured by the monarchy for services to the Commonwealth.

== Canada ==
The original Canadian Establishment began as a mix between the British and U.S. models, combining political appointments and business acumen. The [[Family Compact]] is the first identifiable Canadian Establishment in Anglophone Canada. In francophone Canada, the local leaders of the Catholic Church also played a major role.

The journalist [[Peter C. Newman]] defined the modern "Canadian Establishment" in his 1975 book [[The Canadian Establishment]]. It catalogued the richest individuals and families living in Canada at the time. All of the specific people he identified were prominent business leaders, especially in the media and in public transit. Newman reports that several of these old families have maintained their importance into the 21st century.

According to Anglo-American journalist Peter Brimelow, Newman's establishment was overshadowed by a new class. His book The Patriot Game "makes a swinging attack on the political, bureaucratic, and academic establishment whose entire well-being rests on the promotion of Canadian nationalism. [He] identifies the federal Liberal party as the selfish and thoughtless inventor of this modern activity of creating a Canadian identity, he argues that it is now a pervasive disease throughout Canada's national political and cultural elite."&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/573245/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==

The term "[[Official Ireland]]" is commonly used in the [[Republic of Ireland]] to denote the media, cultural and religious establishment.

== Hong Kong and Macau ==
The term is also used in [[politics of Hong Kong]] and [[Politics of Macau|Macau]], where political parties, community groups, chambers of commerce, trade unions and individuals who are cooperative with and loyal to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the post-[[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover]] [[Hong Kong Government]] are labelled (most often self-labelled) "[[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing]]" or "[[Pro-Beijing camp (Macau)|pro-establishment]]". The term first appeared in 2004.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Pakistan ==
Deemed the [[Deep state|Deep State]].The terminology is used in [[Pakistan]] to describe the cooperative federation of the powerful military and military led Intelligence agencies .&lt;ref name="Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haqqani|first=Husain|title=Pakistan&amp;nbsp;: between mosque and military|year=2005|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0870032141|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of Establishment is no different from "The Establishment" in the United Kingdom. However establishment in Pakistan is much stronger than anyother entity.

The Establishment's sphere mainly consists of the country's high-ranking military officers particularly military Generals belonging to [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] . Others included are senior civil servants, members of the Judiciary, the most important financiers and industrialists and the media moguls. The Establishment in Pakistan considers the key and elite decision makers in country's public policy, ranging from the use of the intelligence services, national security, foreign and domestic policies. They are believed to be behind the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état]] and are behind the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] government and its current ascension to power.

The '''values''' embodied in [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; are identified in order to assess significance, prioritize resources, and inform [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] decision-making. It is recognised that values may compete and change over time, and that heritage may have different meanings for different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].

==Origins==
[[Alois Riegl]] is credited with developing [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s concept of 'voicefulness' into a systematic categorization of the different values of a [[monument]]. In his 1908 essay ''Der moderne Denkmalkultus'' (The modern cult of monuments) he describes historical value, artistic value, age value, commemorative value, use value, and newness value. Riegl demonstrates that some of these values conflict and argues that they may be culturally [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage |author=Stanley Price, Nicholas ''et al.'' (edd.) |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |pages=18–21, 69–83 |ISBN=0-89236-398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charters and Conventions==
The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] addresses cultural sites of outstanding universal value, from a [[History|historical]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Science|scientific]], [[Ethnology|ethnological]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, and highlights the need for [[Authenticity (heritage)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide08-en.pdf |title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention |pages=13, 94) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussed in the 1964 [[Venice Charter]], values and the question 'why conserve?' are the focus of the 1979 [[Burra Charter]] (last revised 1999). Cultural significance is said to be 'embodied' in the fabric, setting, use, associations, and meanings of a place, and includes aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and spiritual values for past, present and future generations. In order to preserve such values a 'cautious approach' of [[minimum intervention]] is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/BURRA_CHARTER.pdf |title=Burra Charter (''vid.'' Preamble, Articles 1, 3, Guidelines) |publisher=[[Australia ICOMOS]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China |page=55) |publisher=China [[ICOMOS]]/[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Managing Built Heritage: The Role of Cultural Significance |author1=Worthing, Derek |author2=Bond, Stephen |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |pages=94ff |year=2008 |ISBN=978-1-4051-1978-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
[[Significance assessment]] typically includes consideration of the rarity, representativeness, and communicative power of assets and their values. These are then managed in order to sustain and valorize that significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |pages=36f |author=Deacon, Harriet (et al.) |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|HSRC Press]] |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-7969-2074-4 |access-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012222850/http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/publications/docs/conservationprinciplespoliciesandguidanceapril08web.pdf |title=Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment |pages=21ff |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engagement with the economic value of heritage may help promote its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/econrpt.pdf |title=Economics and Heritage Conservation |page=54 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The VizieR Catalogue Service''' is an [[astronomical catalog]] service provided by [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]].

The origin of the VizieR Catalogue Service dates back to 1993 as the ESA [[European Space Information System]] Catalogue Browser. Initially intended to serve the Space Science community, the ESIS project pre-dates the World Wide Web as a network database allowing uniform access to a heterogeneous set of catalogues and data.

The [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] had for years collected and disseminated astronomical data, so the original ESIS Catalogue Browser was transferred to and stored at CDS. Since its inception in 1996, VizieR has become a reference point for astronomers worldwide engaged in research, who come to access catalogued data regularly published in astronomical journals. The new VizieR service was refurbished in 1997 by the CDS to better serve the community in terms of searching capabilities and data volume. As of March 2012 it contains more than 9800 catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizier//index.htx#desc VizieR Description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The VizieR catalog is now a major data source as part of the [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].
