      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">An '''action alert''' is a message that an organization sends to mobilize people, often members of the group and supporters of a specific point of view, calling on them to take action to influence public policy.&lt;ref name="one hour"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3RMP-BcnkC ''The one-hour activist: the 15 most powerful actions you can take to fight for the issues and candidates you care about''] Christopher Kush, John Wiley and Sons, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7879-7300-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhRh1LH8tOMC ''Cybercitizen: How to Use Your Computer to Fight for All the Issues You Care about''] Christopher Kush, Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|0-312-26305-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-26305-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, action alerts are in reference to a timely issue, where prompt action is needed in order to affect upcoming decisions.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt;

==Description==
Action alerts are considered a cost-effective and efficient grassroots organizing tool and are employed widely by many advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="one hour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; A well-designed action alert can be a "powerful way to invite people to participate in the processes of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5H1-i6LHu0C ''The Nonprofit Manager's Resource Directory''], Ronald A. Landskroner, John Wiley and Sons, 2001; {{ISBN|0-471-39242-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-471-39242-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Action alerts may, for instance, ask supporters to:
*Contact their legislator to highlight the issue or argue for/against proposed legislation; or
*Write a [[letter to the editor]] about a specific item in the news.
Action alerts commonly begin by explaining the public policy issue to the recipients, and then tell the reader how they can impact the decision. Action alerts go by many other names. [[Amnesty International]], for instance, refers to them as "Urgent actions".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403121614/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |archivedate=2005-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive management''' ('''AM'''), also known as '''adaptive resource management''' ('''ARM''') or '''adaptive environmental assessment and management''' ('''AEAM'''), is a structured, [[iteration|iterative]] process of robust [[decision making]] in the face of [[uncertainty]], with an aim to reducing uncertainty over time via [[system monitoring]]. In this way, decision making simultaneously meets one or more [[resource management]] objectives and, either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future management. Adaptive management is a tool which should be used not only to change a system, but also to learn about the system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management|last=Holling|first=C.S.|publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons|year=1978|isbn=9781932846072|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because adaptive management is based on a learning process, it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge in using the adaptive management approach lies in finding the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EMxPZu99B_MC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false|title=Adaptive Environmental Management: A Practitioner's Guide|last=Allan|first=Catherine|last2=Stankey|first2=George Henry|date=2009-06-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp;amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has more recently been employed in implementing [[international development]] programs.

==Objectives==
There are a number of scientific and social processes which are vital components of adaptive management, including:
* Management is linked to appropriate temporal and spatial scales
* Management retains a focus on [[statistical power]] and controls
* Use of computer models to build synthesis and an embodied ecological consensus
* Use of embodied ecological consensus to evaluate strategic alternatives
* Communication of alternatives to political arena for negotiation of a selection

The achievement of these objectives requires an open management process which seeks to include past, present and future [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. Adaptive management needs to at least maintain [[Glasnost|political openness]], but usually aims to create it. Adaptive management must therefore be a [[scientific]] and social process. It must focus on the development of new [[institutions]] and institutional strategies in balance with [[scientific hypothesis]] and experimental frameworks (resilliance.org).

Adaptive management can proceed as either passive or active adaptive management, depending on how learning takes place. Passive adaptive management values learning only insofar as it improves decision outcomes (i.e. passively), as measured by the specified utility function. In contrast, active adaptive management explicitly incorporates learning as part of the objective function, and hence, decisions which improve learning are valued over those which do not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive management of renewable resources|last=1944-|first=Walters, Carl J.|date=1986-01-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0029479704|oclc=13184654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, as new knowledge is gained, the models are updated and optimal management strategies are derived accordingly. Thus, while learning occurs in both cases, it is treated differently. Often, deriving actively adaptive policies is technically very difficult, which prevents it being more commonly applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Gemma|last2=Crammond|first2=Brad|last3=Malbon|first3=Eleanor|last4=Carey|first4=Nic|date=2015-09-18|title=Adaptive Policies for Reducing Inequalities in the Social Determinants of Health|journal=International Journal of Health Policy and Management|volume=4|issue=11|pages=763–767|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2015.170|issn=2322-5939|pmc=4629702|pmid=26673337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Key features of both passive and active adaptive management are:
*Iterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*[[Feedback]] between monitoring and decisions (learning)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference
*[[Bayesian inference]]
*Embracing [[risk]] and uncertainty as a way of building understanding

However, a number of process failures related to information feedback can prevent effective adaptive management decision making:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Elzinga, Caryl|last2=W|first2=Salzer, Daniel|last3=W|first3=Willoughby, John|date=1998-01-01|title=Measuring &amp; Monitering Plant Populations|journal=U.s. Bureau of Land Management Papers|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usblmpub/17/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[data collection]] is never completely implemented
* data are collected but not analyzed
* [[data analysis|data are analyzed]] but results are inconclusive
* data are analyzed and are interesting, but are not presented to decision makers
* data are analyzed and presented, but are not used for decision-making because of internal or external factors

==History==
The use of adaptive management techniques can be traced back to peoples from ancient civilisations. For example, the [[Yap]] people of Micronesia have been using adaptive management techniques to sustain high [[population density|population densities]] in the face of resource scarcity for thousands of years (Falanruw 1984). In using these techniques, the Yap people have altered their environment creating, for example, coastal [[mangrove]] depressions and [[seagrass]] meadows to support fishing and termite resistant wood (Stankey and Shinder 1997).

The origin of the adaptive management concept can be traced back to ideas of [[scientific management]] pioneered by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] in the early 1900s (Haber 1964). While the term "adaptive management" evolved in natural resource management workshops through decision makers, managers and scientists focussing on building simulation models to uncover key assumptions and uncertainties (Bormann ''et al.'' 1999)&lt;!-- ### This sentence is incomplete. Managagers and sci. did what? --&gt;

Two ecologists at The [[University of British Columbia]], [[C. S. Holling|C.S. Holling]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and C.J Walters&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; further developed the adaptive management approach as they distinguished between passive and active adaptive management practice. [[Kai Lee]], notable Princeton physicist, expanded upon the approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s while pursuing a post-doctorate degree at UC [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. The approach was further developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], while C.S. Holling was director of the Institute. In 1992, Hilbourne described three learning models for federal land managers, around which adaptive management approaches could be developed, these are reactive, passive and active.

Adaptive management has probably been most frequently applied in Yap, [[Australia]] and [[North America]], initially applied in [[fishery]] management, but received more broad application in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most successful applications of adaptive management has been in the area of waterfowl harvest management in North America, most notably for the [[mallard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=James D.|last2=Johnson|first2=Fred A.|last3=Williams|first3=Byron K.|last4=Boomer|first4=G. Scott|date=2015-06-01|title=On formally integrating science and policy: walking the walk|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=539–543|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12406|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptive management in a conservation project and program context can trace its roots back to at least the early 1990s, with the establishment of the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/index.html Biodiversity Support Program]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989.  BSP was a [http://www.usaid.gov/ USAID]-funded consortium of WWF&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/ WWF]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nature Conservancy (TNC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnc.org/ The Nature Conservancy]&lt;/ref&gt; and World Resources Institute (WRI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/ World Resources Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Analysis and Adaptive Management Program sought to understand the conditions under which certain conservation strategies were most effective and to identify lessons learned across conservation projects.  When BSP ended in 2001, TNC and Foundations of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosonline.org/ Foundations of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS, a non-profit which grew out of BSP) continued to actively work in promoting adaptive management for conservation projects and programs.  The approaches used included Conservation by Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/cbdgateway/ Conservation by Design]&lt;/ref&gt; (TNC) and Measures of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/M/bo3559851.html Measures of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS).

In 2004, the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/ Conservation Measures Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; – which includes several former BSP members – developed a common set of standards and guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management/ | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; for applying adaptive management to conservation projects and programs.

==Use in environmental practices==
Applying adaptive management in a conservation project or program involves the integration of project/program design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn. The three components of adaptive management in environmental practice are:

*''Testing assumptions'' is about systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is not, however, a random trial-and-error process.  Rather, it involves using knowledge about the specific site to pick the best known strategy, laying out the assumptions behind how that strategy will work, and then collecting monitoring data to determine if the assumptions hold true.
*''Adaptation'' involves changing assumptions and interventions to respond to new or different information obtained through monitoring and project experience.
*''Learning'' is about explicitly documenting a team's planning and implementation processes and its successes and failures for internal learning as well as learning across the conservation community.  This learning enables conservation practitioners to design and manage projects better and avoid some of the perils others have encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stankey|first=George H.|last2=Clark|first2=Roger N.|last3=Bormann|first3=Bernard T.|last4=Stankey|first4=George H.|last5=Clark|first5=Roger N.|last6=Bormann|first6=Bernard T.|title=Adaptive management of natural resources: theory, concepts, and management institutions.|url=https://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20657/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about a managed system is only useful in cases where management decisions are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rout|first=Tracy M.|last2=Hauser|first2=Cindy E.|last3=Possingham|first3=Hugh P.|date=2009-03-01|title=Optimal adaptive management for the translocation of a threatened species|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=515–526|doi=10.1890/07-1989.1|issn=1939-5582|pmid=19323207|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:181588/UQ181588_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to environmental projects and programs==
[[Image:CMP Cycle - 2008-02-20.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: CMP Adaptive Management Cycle]]

''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management ''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation'']&lt;/ref&gt; lays out five main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1).  The ''Open Standards'' represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community.  Since the release of the initial ''Open Standards'' (updated in 2007 and 2013), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these ''Open Standards'' to their work.  In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards.

Some recent write-ups of adaptive management in conservation include:  wildlife protection (SWAP, 2008), forests ecosystem protection (CMER, 2010), coastal protection and restoration (LACPR, 2009), natural resource management (water, land and soil), species conservation especially, fish conservation from [[overfishing]] (FOS, 2007) and [[climate change]] (DFG, 2010). In addition, some other examples follow:
 
*In 2006–2007, FOS worked with The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to develop an evaluation system help NFWF gauge impact across the various coral reef habitat and species conservation projects;
*In 2007, FOS worked with the Ocean Conservancy (OC) to evaluate the effectiveness of this Scorecard in helping to end overfishing in domestic fisheries.
*Between 1999–2004, FOS worked for WWF's Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) Program to ensure that Asian elephants and rhinos thrive in secure habitats within their historical range and in harmony with people.
*The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is developing and implementing adaptation strategies to help protect, restore and manage fish and wildlife, with the understanding that some level of climate change will occur and that it will have profound effects on ecosystems in the United States.
*The Adaptive Management program was created by CMR to provide science-based recommendations and technical information to assist the Forest Practices Board. In April 2010, the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Annual Science Conference was held in Washington.
*In 2009, The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Technical Report has been developed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) according to adaptive management process.
*Since 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service has been managing its marine protected areas using adaptive management in an ongoing process of learning through the  Science for Active Management (SAM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sam4wio.weebly.com Science for Active Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Program.

==In international development==

The concept of adaptive management is not restricted to natural resources or ecosystem management, as similar concepts have been applied to [[international development]] programming.&lt;ref&gt;"2 Adaptive Management Theories, Frameworks, and Practices." National Research Council. 2004. Adaptive Management for Water Resources Project Planning.  Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rondinell, D. A. (1993) Development Projects as Policy Experiments: an adaptive approach to development administration, 2nd ed, Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt; This has often been a recognition to the "wicked" nature of many development challenges and the limits of traditional planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, M. and Rittel, H. (1973), "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning", Policy Sciences, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramalingam, B., Laric, M. and Primrose, J. (2014) 'From Best Practice to Best Fit: Understanding and Navigating Wicked Problems in International Development'. Working Paper. London: ODI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Head, B. and Alford, J. (2008) "Wicked Problems: The Implications for Public Management", 12th Annual Conference International Research Society for Public Management, Vol. Panel on Public Management in Practice, 26–28 March 2008, Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal changes facing international development organizations is the need to be more flexible, adaptable and focused on learning.&lt;ref&gt;S. Smith and A. Young, "Adapting to change: becoming a learning organization as a relief and development agency," in IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, vol. 52, no. 4, pp. 329-345, Dec. 2009. {{doi|10.1109/TPC.2009.2034240}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in international development approaches such as Doing Development Differently, Politically Informed Programming and Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, M., Pritchett, L. and Woolcock, M. (2015) Doing problem driven work. Working Paper 30. Cambridge, MA: Center for International Development at [[Harvard University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, D. and Unsworth, S. (2014) Politically smart, locally-led development. ODI discussion paper London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, V., Levy, B., and Ort, R. (2014) Problem-driven political economy analysis: The World Bank's experience. Washington DC: [[World Bank]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent example of the use of adaptive management by international development donors is the planned Global Learning for Adaptive Management (GLAM) programme to support adaptive management in [[Department for International Development]] and [[USAID]]. The program is establishing a centre for learning about adaptive management to support the utilization and accessibility of adaptive management.&lt;ref&gt;Funds for NGOs.

Retrieved May 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, donors have been focused on amending their own programmatic guidance to reflect the importance of learning within programs: for instance, USAID's recent focus in their ADS guidance on the importance of collaborating, learning and adapting.&lt;ref name="usaid.gov"&gt;USAID. [https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/201.pdf "ADS Chapter 201 Program Cycle Operational Policy"]. Retrieved April 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USAID Learning Lab. [https://usaidlearninglab.org/faq/collaborating-learning-and-adapting-cla "CLA"]. Retrieved April 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected in Department for International Development's Smart Rules that provide the operating framework for their programs including the use of evidence to inform their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;DFID. [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-smart-rules-better-programme-delivery "DFID Smart Rules: Better Programme Deliver"]. Retrieved April 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of tools used to operationalize adaptive management in programs, such as [[learning agenda]]s.

Collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) is a concept related to the operationalizing of adaptive management in international development that describes a specific way of designing, implementing, adapting and evaluating programs.&lt;ref&gt;Altschuld, J. W., &amp; Watkins, R. (2015). Needs assessment: trends and a view toward the future. New Directions for Evaluation, Number 144. Hoboken, NJ: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}&lt;ref&gt;Janus, Steffen Soulejman. (2016). Becoming a knowledge-sharing organization: a handbook for scaling up solutions through knowledge capturing and sharing. Washington, D.C.: [[World Bank Group]]. http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25320&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} CLA involves three concepts:
#collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
#learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking the time to reflect on implementation, and
#adapting strategically based on applied learning. CLA practices have tangible benefits; for instance, a recent study recently found that companies "which apply more data-driven and adaptive leadership practices perform better" when examined against those which focus less on those practices.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, P., Tse, M., Khan, Z. and Rao-Nicholson, R. (2016) Data-driven and adaptive leadership contributing to the sustainability of global agri-food supply chains connected with emerging markets.

CLA integrates three closely connected concepts within the organizational theory literature: namely collaborating, learning and adapting. There is evidence of the benefits of collaborating internally within an organization and externally with organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://usaidlearninglab.org/library/literature-review-evidence-base-collaborating,-learning,-and-adapting|title=Literature review of the evidence base for collaborating, learning, and adapting|last=Lab|first=Learning|date=2016-08-11|work=USAID Learning Lab|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the production and transmission of knowledge—both [[explicit knowledge]] and [[tacit knowledge]]—occurs through collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Polanyi, Michael (1966), The tacit dimension.

==Use in other practices as a tool for sustainability==
Adaptive management as a systematic process for improving environmental management policies and practices is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking [[sustainability]] solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive management as a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions.  The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies.
Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework to ensure that the organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, &amp; Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (Verine, 2008). This "learning to manage by managing to learn" (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy.

Sustainable community development requires recognition of the relationship between environment, economics and social instruments within the community. An adaptive management approach to creating sustainable community policy and practice also emphasizes the connection and confluence of those elements. Looking into the cultural mechanisms which contribute to a community value system often highlights the  parallel to adaptive management practices, "with [an] emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability" (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000). Often this is the result of indigenous knowledge and historical decisions of societies deeply rooted in ecological practices (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000).  By applying an adaptive management approach to community development the resulting systems can develop built in sustainable practice as  explained by the Environmental Advisory Council (2002), "active adaptive management views policy as a set of experiments designed to reveal processes that build or sustain resilience. It requires, and facilitates, a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options" (p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

In an ever-changing world, adaptive management appeals to many practices seeking sustainable solutions by offering a framework for decision making that proposes to support a sustainable future which, "conserves and nurtures the diversity—of species, of human opportunity, of learning institutions and of economic options"(The Environmental Advisory Council, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

== Effectiveness ==
It is difficult to test the effectiveness of adaptive management in comparison to other management approaches. One challenge is that once a system is managed using one approach it is difficult to determine how another approach would have performed in exactly the same situation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553–1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|pmid=27755756|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study tested the effectiveness of formal passive adaptive management in comparison to human intuition by having natural resource management students make decisions about how to harvest a hypothetical fish population in an online computer game. The students on average performed poorly in comparison to the computer programs implementing passive adaptive management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/sometimes-even-bad-models-make-better-decisions-than-people-4956bade3990#.cnenr5clc|title=Sometimes, Even Bad Models Make Better Decisions Than People|last=Standard|first=Pacific|date=2016-03-11|newspaper=Pacific Standard|access-date=2016-12-22}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allowable Strength Design''' (ASD) is a term used by the [[American Institute of Steel Construction]] (AISC) in the 14th Edition of the Manual of Steel Construction.

Allowable '''Stress''' Design philosophy was left unsupported by AISC after the 9th edition of the manual which remained an acceptable [[reference design]] standard in evolving [[building code]]s (e.g. [[International Building Code]] by the [[International Code Council]]). This presented problems since new research, engineering concepts and design philosophy were ignored in the minimum requirements and references in the aging 9th edition. As a result, structures that were code compliant based on design using the [[Permissible stress design|Allowable Stress Design]] methods may not have been code compliant if reviewed with the [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) requirements - particularly where the LRFD procedures explicitly defined additional analysis which was not explicitly defined in the Allowable Stress Design procedures.

AISC's Allowable '''Strength''' Design applies a quasi-[[safety factor]] approach to evaluating allowable strength. Ultimate strength of an element or member is determined in the same manner regardless of the load combination method considered (e.g. ASD or LRFD). [[Design load]] combination effects are determined in a manner appropriate to the intended form of the analysis results. ASD load combinations are compared to the ultimate strength reduced by a factor (omega) which provides a mathematical form similar to Allowable Stress Design resolved with a safety factor.

This AISC Allowable Strength Design does not attempt to relate capacity to elastic stress levels. Therefore, it is inappropriate to refer to the procedure or philosophy as either Allowable Stress or Permissible Stress Design.

The '''analysis of competing hypotheses''' ('''ACH''') allegedly provides an unbiased [[methodology]] for evaluating multiple competing hypotheses for observed data. It was developed by [[Richards Heuer|Richards (Dick) J. Heuer, Jr.]], a 45-year veteran of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], in the 1970s for use by the Agency.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt; ACH is used by analysts in various fields who make judgments that entail a high risk of error in reasoning. It helps an analyst overcome, or at least minimize, some of the cognitive limitations that make prescient [[intelligence analysis]] so difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;

ACH was a step forward in [[Intelligence analysis#Methods of analysis|intelligence analysis methodology]], but it was first described in relatively informal terms. Producing the best available information from [[uncertain data]] remains the goal of researchers, tool-builders, and analysts in industry, academia and government. Their domains include [[data mining]], [[cognitive psychology]] and [[visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]], etc. [[Abductive reasoning]] is an earlier concept with similarities to ACH.

==Process==
Heuer outlines the ACH process in considerable depth in his book, ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis''.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt; It consists of the following steps:
# Hypothesis – The first step of the process is to identify all potential hypotheses, preferably using a group of analysts with different perspectives to [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] the possibilities. The process discourages the analyst from choosing one "likely" hypothesis and using evidence to prove its accuracy. [[Cognitive bias]] is minimized when all possible hypotheses are considered.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Evidence – The analyst then lists evidence and arguments (including assumptions and logical deductions) for and against each hypothesis.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Diagnostics – Using a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], the analyst applies evidence against each hypothesis in an attempt to disprove as many theories as possible. Some evidence will have greater "diagnosticity" than other evidence — that is, some will be more helpful in judging the relative likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This step is the most important, according to Heuer. Instead of looking at one hypothesis and all the evidence ("working down" the matrix), the analyst is encouraged to consider one piece of evidence at a time, and examine it against all possible hypotheses ("working across" the matrix).&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Refinement – The analyst reviews the findings, identifies any gaps, and collects any additional evidence needed to refute as many of the remaining hypotheses as possible.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Inconsistency – The analyst then seeks to draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Less consistency implies a lower likelihood. The least consistent hypotheses are eliminated. While the matrix generates a definitive mathematical total for each hypothesis, the analyst must use their judgment to make the final conclusion. The result of the ACH analysis itself must not overrule analysts' own judgments.
# Sensitivity – The analyst tests the conclusions using [[sensitivity analysis]], which weighs how the conclusion would be affected if key evidence or arguments were wrong, misleading, or subject to different interpretations. The validity of key evidence and the consistency of important arguments are double-checked to assure the soundness of the conclusion's [[intelligence analysis#Linchpin analysis|linchpins]] and drivers.&lt;ref name=CH8&gt;{{citation |title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis |first=Richards J., Jr |last=Heuer |contribution=Chapter 8: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art11.html |publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence, [[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conclusions and evaluation – Finally, the analyst provides the decisionmaker with his or her conclusions, as well as a summary of alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected. The analyst also identifies milestones in the process that can serve as indicators in future analyses.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;

==Strengths==
There are many benefits of doing an ACH matrix. It is auditable. It is widely believed to help overcome [[cognitive bias]]es, though there is a lack of strong empirical evidence to support this belief.&lt;ref name=Thomason2010&gt;{{citation |title=Field Evaluation in the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Context:  Workshop Summary |first=Neil |last=Thomason |contribution=Alternative Competing Hypotheses |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12854.html |year=2010 |publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ACH requires the analyst to construct a matrix, the evidence and hypotheses can be [[backtracking|backtracked]]. This allows the decisionmaker or other analysts to see the sequence of rules and data that led to the conclusion.

==Weaknesses==
The process to create an ACH is time consuming. The ACH matrix can be problematic when analyzing a complex project. It can be cumbersome for an analyst to manage a large database with multiple pieces of evidence.

Especially in intelligence, both governmental and business, analysts must always be aware that the opponent(s) is intelligent and may be generating information intended to [[deception|deceive]].&lt;ref name=Elsaesser&gt;{{citation |contribution=Detecting Deception |first1=Christopher |last1=Elsaesser |first2=Frank J. |last2=Stech |pages=101–124 |year=2007 |title=Adversarial Reasoning: Computational Approaches to Reading the Opponent’s Mind |editor1=Kott, Alexander |editor2=McEneaney, William |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stech&gt;{{citation |title=Deception Detection by Analysis of Competing Hypotheses |first1=Frank J. |last1=Stech |first2=Christopher |last2=Elsaesser |publisher=[[MITRE Corporation]] |url=https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/94_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807192930/https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/94_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }} MITRE Sponsored Research Project 51MSR111, Counter-Deception Decision Support&lt;/ref&gt; Since deception often is the result of a cognitive trap, Elsaesser and Stech use state-based hierarchical plan recognition (see [[abductive reasoning]]) to generate causal explanations of observations. The resulting hypotheses are converted to a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] and [[value of information]] analysis is employed to isolate assumptions implicit in the evaluation of paths in, or conclusions of, particular hypotheses. As evidence in the form of observations of states or assumptions is observed, they can become the subject of separate validation. Should an assumption or necessary state be negated, hypotheses depending on it are rejected. This is a form of [[root cause analysis]].

Evidence also presents a problem if it is unreliable. The evidence used in the matrix is static and therefore it can be a snapshot in time.

According to social constructivist critics, ACH also fails to stress sufficiently (or to address as a method) the problematic nature of the initial formation of the hypotheses used to create its grid.  There is considerable evidence, for example, that in addition to any bureaucratic, psychological, or political biases that may affect hypothesis generation, there are also factors of culture and identity at work. These socially constructed factors may restrict or pre-screen which hypotheses end up being considered, and then reinforce confirmation bias in those selected.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters one to four, {{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. and  |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe|year=2013  |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947-2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804793360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation theorist]] [[Tim van Gelder]] has made the following criticisms:&lt;ref name=vanGelder2008&gt;{{citation |title=Can we do better than ACH? |url=http://timvangelder.com/2007/12/31/hypothesis-testing-whats-wrong-with-ach/ |journal=AIPIO News |issue=Issue 55 |date=December 2008 |last=van Gelder |first=Tim |publisher=Australian Institute of Professional Intelligence Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ACH demands that the analyst makes too many discrete judgments, a great many of which contribute little if anything to discerning the best hypothesis
* ACH misconceives the nature of the relationship between items of evidence and hypotheses by supposing that items of evidence are, on their own, consistent or inconsistent with hypotheses.
* ACH treats the hypothesis set as "flat", i.e. a mere list, and so is unable to relate evidence to hypotheses at the appropriate levels of abstraction
* ACH cannot represent subordinate argumentation, i.e. the argumentation bearing up on a piece of evidence.
* ACH activities at realistic scales leave analysts disoriented or confused.

Van Gelder proposed ''hypothesis mapping'' as an alternative to ACH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 December 2012 |last=van Gelder |first=Tim |title=Exploring new directions for intelligence analysis |url=https://timvangelder.com/2012/12/11/exploring-new-directions-for-intelligence-analysis/ |website=timvangelder.com |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=2016 |title=Strategic Thinking in Complex Problem Solving |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780190463908 |oclc=940455195 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190463908.001.0001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0DhRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 113]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structured analysis of competing hypotheses===
The structured analysis of competing hypotheses offers analysts an improvement over the limitations of the original ACH.{{discuss|April 2008}}&lt;ref name=Wheaton2006&gt;{{citation |title=Structured Analysis of Competing Hypotheses: Improving a Tested Intelligence Methodology |journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine |volume=9 |issue=6 |date=November–December 2006 |pages=12–15 |url=http://www.mcmanis-monsalve.com/assets/publications/intelligence-methodology-1-07-chido.pdf |author=Wheaton |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Kristan J. |display-authors=2 |author3=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928154654/http://www.mcmanis-monsalve.com/assets/publications/intelligence-methodology-1-07-chido.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACH maximizes the possible hypotheses by allowing the analyst to split one hypothesis into two complex ones.

For example, two tested hypotheses could be that Iraq has WMD or Iraq does not have WMD. If the evidence showed that it is more likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses could be that Iraq has biological WMD, Iraq has chemical WMD and Iraq has nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Chido |title=Structured Analysis Of Competing Hypotheses: Theory and Application |publisher=[[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]] Press |year=2006 |page=54 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Diane E. |display-authors=2 |author3=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches to formalism===
One method, by Valtorta and colleagues uses probabilistic methods, adds [[Bayesian analysis]] to ACH.&lt;ref name=Valtorta&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cse.sc.edu/~mgv/reports/IA-05.pdf |contribution=Extending Heuer's Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Method to Support Complex Decision Analysis |author=Valtorta, Marco |title=International Conference on Intelligence Analysis Methods and Tools |date=May 2005 |display-authors=1 |author2=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generalization of this concept to a distributed community of analysts lead to the development of CACHE (the Collaborative ACH Environment),&lt;ref&gt;Shrager, J., et al. (2009) Soccer science and the Bayes community: Exploring the cognitive implications of modern scientific communication. Topics in Cognitive Science, 2(1), 53–72.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the concept of a Bayes (or Bayesian) community. The work by Akram and Wang applies paradigms from [[graph theory]].&lt;ref name=Akram2006&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.huitfeldt.com/repository/ITW06.pdf |contribution=Investigative Data Mining: Connecting the dots to disconnect them |pages=28–34 |first1=Shaikh Muhammad |last1=Akram |last2=Wang |first2=Jiaxin |title=Proceedings of the 2006 Intelligence Tools Workshop |date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other work focuses less on probabilistic methods and more on cognitive and visualization extensions to ACH, as discussed by Madsen and Hicks.&lt;ref name=Madsen2006&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.huitfeldt.com/repository/ITW06.pdf |contribution=Investigating the Cognitive Effects of Externalization Tools |pages=4–11 |first1=Fredrik H. |last1=Madsen |first2=David L. |last2=Hicks |title=Proceedings of the 2006 Intelligence Tools Workshop |date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; DECIDE, discussed under [[#Automation|automation]] is visualization-oriented.&lt;ref name=Cluxton2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Diane |last1=Cluxton |first2=Stephen G. |last2=Eick |contribution="DECIDE Hypothesis Visualization Tool" |title=2005 Intl conf on Intelligence Analysis |url=https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/119_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807192605/https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/119_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by Pope and Jøsang uses [[subjective logic]], a formal mathematical methodology that explicitly deals with uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Pope2005&gt;{{citation |id=ADA463908 |title= Analysis of Competing Hypotheses using Subjective Logic (ACH-SL) |publisher=Queensland University, Brisbane, Australia |last1=Pope |first1=Simon |last2=Josang |first2=Audun |date= June 2005 |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA463908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This methodology forms the basis of the Sheba technology that is used in Veriluma's intelligence assessment software.

==Automation==
A few online and downloadable tools help automate the ACH process. These programs leave a visual trail of evidence and allow the analyst to weigh evidence.

== Background ==

=== Climate change and species range shifts ===
[[Climate change]] is expected to drive many species out of parts of their current [[species distribution|ranges]] while creating new suitable habitats elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02121 |pmid=14712274 |last1=Thomas |first1=C.

=== Assisted colonization vs. species introduction ===
Assisted colonization is a specific type of [[introduced species|species introduction]]. An introduction is any act of establishing a species in a habitat it does not currently occupy. It often refers to a long-distance relocation, such as the accidental introduction of an [[invasive species]] from one continent to another, or the intentional relocation of a species in decline to a habitat where it can persist. By contrast, assisted colonization acknowledges that the natural [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] rate of many species may be too slow to naturally respond to rapid human-caused environmental change and asks, “if this species could disperse fast enough to keep pace with the changing environment, where would it establish?” Assisted colonization practitioners consider helping the species disperse into such sites, which are often immediately adjacent to the species’ historical range.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = M. L. | title = Climate Change and Moving Species: Furthering the Debate on Assisted Colonization | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00780.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 1356–1358 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17883502| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted colonization thus represents a small artificial boost to an otherwise natural process, acknowledging that the threat—rapid human-caused environmental change—was produced by humans in the first place. Confusion of assisted colonization with species introduction in general—often much larger in scale and with greater risk of adverse impacts—may be the principal reason why some are reluctant to consider assisted colonization (see [[#Controversy|Controversy]], below).&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Hellmann | first2 = J.

=== Terminology ===
When first proposed, the idea was referred to as “assisted migration”.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The terminology was later criticized for being reminiscent of natural, cyclic animal migrations in response to changing seasons.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; It was renamed “assisted colonization,” as colonization more accurately describes the natural phenomenon that management would seek to assist. Others have sought to further distinguish this idea from any natural process by referring to it as “managed relocation.”&lt;ref name=Sax&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D. F. | last2 = Smith | first2 = K. F. | last3 = Thompson | first3 = A.

=== Acclimatization and adaptation as alternatives to colonization ===
Even under rapid climate change, dispersal into new areas may not be necessary for some species to persist. Instead of tracking climate shifts through space, some species may be able to survive in their present locations by developing tolerance to new conditions through [[acclimatization]] and/or [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice|first1=Kevin J.|last2=Emery|first2=Nancy C.|year=2003|title=Managing microevolution: Restoration in the face of global change|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=1|issue=9|pages=469–478|doi=10.2307/3868114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skelly | first1 = D.

One study determined that evolution of higher temperature tolerance in some species of amphibians and reptiles will likely occur fast enough to allow these species to survive a 3&amp;nbsp;°C temperature increase over 100 years, consistent with low- to mid-range projections of global warming.&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; By contrast, many species, such as most [[temperate]] trees, have longer generation times and therefore may adapt more slowly; they may take thousands of years to evolve a similar increase in temperature tolerance.&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; Adaptation this slow would be insufficient for keeping up with expected future global warming if colonization of new habitats is not an option.

== Types ==
Generally speaking, there are three accepted ways that assisted colonization can take place, each one of them with specific benefits and situations in which it applies. They can be defined as reintroduction, introduction and augmentation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Weeks|first = Andrew R|last2 = Sgro|first2 = Carla M|last3 = Young|first3 = Andrew G|last4 = Frankham|first4 = Richard|last5 = Mitchell|first5 = Nicki J|last6 = Miller|first6 = Kim A|last7 = Byrne|first7 = Margaret|last8 = Coates|first8 = David J|last9 = Eldridge|first9 = Mark D B|date = 2011-11-01|title = Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal = Evolutionary Applications|volume = 4|issue = 6|pages = 709–725|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|issn = 1752-4571|pmc = 3265713|pmid = 22287981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augmentation ===
In augmentation, a population is identified with a small number of mating individuals. This can lead to many problems, including inbreeding depression, and often leads to a dwindling number of individuals. Further complicating matters, with such a small population and consistent inbreeding depression, genetic drift is of worry as well, leading to high levels of homozygosity. To combat these problems, individuals are reintroduced to the population. This can be done via ''ex situ'' breeding of individuals or by physically relocating a separate population to join the identified, problematic population.

=== Introduction ===
In introduction, a species is brought to a habitat in which it has never before existed. This can be done for a number of reasons, ranging from climate change associated habitat loss to the introduction of predator species that cannot be controlled. Generally speaking, this is the type of assisted colonization that contains the most potential for harmful effects, like those described elsewhere in this article. Currently, a number of introductions of endangered populations from Australia have been made with varying degrees of success to small islands near the mainland where the only reason that the population had not dispersed before was due to the physical waterway.

=== Reintroduction ===
Reintroductions involve restoring a species to its native range. The species may no longer be found there due to any number of reasons, though most common is often the introduction of predators or habitat loss due to either climate change or other human factors. This is generally done to broaden the range of threatened populations and to reconnect fragmented populations.

==Controversy==
Significant controversy has developed around the idea of assisted colonization since it was first put forth in the scientific literature in 2007.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The two sides can be separated roughly as follows. Supports generally believe that the expected benefits of assisted colonization, including saving and strengthening species, outweighs the potential harm of any project. Detractors generally believe that other conservation techniques which do not include the high risk of invasive species are not only better suited but are also more likely to succeed. This debate continues throughout the literature generally due to a lack of real-world applications and follow-ups. Though these conservation efforts are becoming increasingly common, few long term looks at their success have been conducted.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

===Invasive species risk===
Perhaps the principal concern scientists have expressed over assisted colonization is the potential for relocated species to be invasive in their new habitats, driving out native species.&lt;ref name=Simberloff&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ricciardi | first1 = A. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.12.006 | title = Assisted colonization is not a viable conservation strategy | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 248 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that assisted colonization will facilitate invasions stems mostly from observations of the vast numbers of species that have become invasive outside their native ranges by (often inadvertent) introduction by humans. Although most agree that assisted colonization efforts, unlike accidental introductions, should involve detailed planning and risk assessment, for some, any threat of introducing invasive species, no matter how small, disqualifies assisted colonization as a viable management response to climate change.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Those who wish to keep assisted colonization on the table often note that the vast majority of historical species invasions have resulted from continent-to-continent or continent-to-island transportation of species and that very few invasions have resulted from the comparatively short-distance, within-continent movement of species proposed for assisted colonization.&lt;ref name=Mueller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoegh&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoegh-Guldberg | first1 = O. | last2 = Hughes | first2 = L. | last3 = McIntyre | first3 = S. | last4 = Lindenmayer | first4 = D.

D. | doi = 10.1126/science.1157897 | title = ECOLOGY: Assisted Colonization and Rapid Climate Change | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5887 | pages = 345–346 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18635780| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mueller and Hellman reviewed 468 documented species invasions and found that only 14.7% occurred on the same continent where the species originated.&lt;ref name=Mueller/&gt; Of the 14.7%, the vast majority were fish and crustaceans. Terrestrial species that became invasive on the same continent where they originated were often transported across large biogeographic barriers, such as mountain ranges. These long-distance, within-continent translocations are unlike expected uses of assisted colonization, which generally involve helping species colonize habitats immediately adjacent to their current ranges.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

===Uncertainty in the planning process===
To identify populations at risk and locate new potential habitats, conservationists often use [[Environmental niche modelling|Niche models]]. These models predict the suitability of habitats in the future based on how closely their climates resemble the climate currently inhabited by the species. Though useful for describing broad trends, these models make a number of unrealistic assumptions that restrict the usefulness of their predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = T.

The uncertainties in predictions of future suitable habitat limits confidence in assisted colonization decisions and has led some to reject assisted colonization entirely.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Despite the uncertainty inherent in predictions of future suitable habitat, some studies have demonstrated that predictions can be quite accurate. A study of Hesperia comma butterflies in Britain identified unoccupied habitat sites that were likely to support the species under a warmer climate based on their similarity to occupied sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = C.

The data suggested that the suitable, uncolonized sites could be good targets for assisted colonization. The results suggested that if investigators can demonstrate their model makes reliable predictions with real-world data, models might be trusted for informing assisted colonization decisions.

===Weighing the risks and benefits===

The science is clear that climate change will drive many species extinct, and a traditional, land-preservation ethic will not prevent extinctions.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; Those wary of moving species instead suggest expanding networks of [[habitat corridor]]s, allowing species to naturally migrate into newly suitable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Krosby | first1 = M. | last2 = Tewksbury | first2 = J. | last3 = Haddad | first3 = N.

Evidence suggests that slowly evolving and slowly dispersing species (including species that are dispersal-limited due to [[habitat fragmentation]]) will decline or go extinct in the absence of assisted colonization programs.&lt;ref name=Hoegh/&gt;

In their rejection of assisted colonization, Ricciardi and Simberloff cite the precautionary principle, stating that any unknown risk, no matter how small, of assisted colonization resulting in the creation of new invasive species is enough to require that it not be undertaken.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt; Many scientists reject this position, however, noting that in many cases where extinctions due to climate change are likely, the risks of extinction from not facilitating colonization are probably far worse than the risks of facilitating colonization.&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; They argue that the precautionary principle cuts both ways, and the risks of inaction must be compared against the risks of action. Others note that the ethics of assisting colonization will depend on the values of the stakeholders involved in a specific decision rather than the position of scientists on assisted colonization in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schlaepfer | first1 = M.

Many therefore believe we should strive to maintain biodiversity and functioning ecosystems in the face of climate change, even if it means actively moving species beyond their native ranges.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; In the absence of assisted colonization, climate change is already causing many highly mobile species, such as butterflies, to colonize areas they have not previously inhabited.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Through assisted colonization, managers could help rare or less-mobile species keep pace, possibly preventing future extinctions due to a their inability to colonize new areas fast enough. Though some argue that nature often responds to challenges more effectively in the absence of human intervention, others note that current climate change, itself, is a human intervention.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Many species that would have been effective dispersers under slower, natural climate change may be left behind by more mobile species under current rates of human-caused climate change. Thus, through changing the climate, humans may already be artificially segregating species even without actively relocating them.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt;

Critics may also have major concerns about different genetic issues when considering assisted colonization such as maladaptation to novel environmental conditions and hybridization with similar species. These often depend on the genetic structure and level of genetic variation in the source populations. The environmental conditions in which these populations are being introduced must also be taken into account. In order to enhance genetic variation, and thus adaptive potential, material could be sourced from multiple populations. This is known as composite provenancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broadhurst|first1=Linda|title=Seed supply for broadscale restoration: maximizing evolutionary potential|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=4 September 2008|volume=1|issue=4|pages=587–597|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00045.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the environmental gradient is well known, such as predictable changes in elevation or aridity, source populations should be ‘genetically matched’ to recipient sites as best as possible to ensure that the translocated individuals ae not maladapted. This strategy of moving species beyond their current range has been suggested for those that are severely threatened or endangered. By moving them outside their native range, hopefully the immediate threats of predation, disease, and habitat loss can be avoided. However, these species are usually already suffering from some sort of genetic issue resulting from low effective population size such as inbreeding depression, loss in genetic diversity, or maladaptation. Therefore, caution must be taken with what few individuals remain and rapid population growth must be the primary goal. In the case of some species, this can be accomplished with a captive breeding program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weeks|first1=Andrew|last2=Sgro|first2=Carla|last3=Young|first3=Andrew|last4=Frankham|first4=Richard|last5=Mitchell|first5=Nicki|last6=Byrne|first6=Margaret|last7=Coates|first7=David|last8=Eldridge|first8=Mark|last9=Sunnucks|first9=Paul|last10=Breed|first10=Martin|last11=James|first11=Elizabeth|last12=Hoffmann|first12=Ary|title=Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=18 June 2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=709–725|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|pmid=22287981|pmc=3265713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Approximately 300 million tree seedlings are planted in the western USA, British Columbia (BC) and Yukon each year. Many climatologists are predicting that the climate could be 3–4°C warmer when those trees are harvested 60-80 years after planting. These changes to climate will expose trees to increased stress and health risks, compromising the many goods and services from our forests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/forgen/interior/AMAT.htm British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations--Assisted Migration Adaptation Trial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this threat, the Ministry has initiated a large-scale study to determine the long-term health of seedlings of 16 tree species planted beyond their native ranges, into areas expected to become suitable due to changes in climate this century.&lt;ref name=Marris&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | title = Forestry: Planting the forest of the future | doi = 10.1038/459906a | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7249 | pages = 906–908 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19536238| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the study will be used to develop guidelines for when and how assisted colonization of trees should be conducted.

In 2009, British Columbia also altered guidelines for selecting seeds for replanting forests after a timber harvest. Previously, foresters were required to use seeds from within 200 meters downhill and 300 meters uphill, but the new policy allows foresters to obtain seeds from up to 500 meters downhill, taking advantage of the fact that populations in warmer habitats downhill may be better adapted to the future climate of the restoration site.&lt;ref name=Marris/&gt;

===Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank, USA===
Although not actively engaging in assisted colonization, the Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank seeks to collect seeds from populations of species expected to decline or disappear due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitt | first1 = P. | last2 = Havens | first2 = K. | last3 = Kramer | first3 = A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6245">{{Buddhism}}
[[Buddhism]] has developed a complex psychology of [[personality types]] (Pali: Puggala-paññatti), [[personality traits]] and underlying tendencies (anusaya). This was mostly developed in the Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] literature and its major concern was to identify differing types of persons for [[pedagogical]] and [[soteriological]] ends. The [[Buddha]] was said to have [[upaya|skillfully taught different teachings]] depending on each person's personality and level of mental development. The development of a [[Personality psychology]] was important to the Abhidharmikas who sought to adapt Buddhist teachings and practice to each personality type so as to better lead persons to [[nirvana]] by purifying their minds of their [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|mental defilements]]. 

==Typologies==
The Buddhist view of the person is encapsulated by the [[Anatta|not-self]] teaching, which states that there is no unchanging core to a person, no soul ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]]) or [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]. A person is defined as a stream of phenomenal events (termed ''dhammas'') in a causal series of mind moments (''samaya''), and therefore an 'individual' or 'person' is merely a conventional designation for a collection of constantly changing processes (the [[five skandhas]]). However, in the analytical Abhidharma works, Buddhists outlined how different individuals could still be dominated by certain proclivities and tendencies, patterns of thought which arose consistently enough to allow one to designate different 'personality types'. 

===Theravada===
The [[Theravada]] [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] contains a section entitled 'The Puggala-paññatti', which translates to "designation of person types" which contains an extensive outline of a wide array of personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramakrishna Rao, Anand C. Paranjpe, Psychology in the Indian Tradition, page 159&lt;/ref&gt; The Abhidhamma generally considered twelve major classes of persons, four of the worldly ordinary class (''puthujjana'') and eight of the spiritual elect (''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'', the noble ones).&lt;ref&gt;Bimala Charan Law, M.A., B.L. DESIGNATION OF HUMAN TYPES (PUGGALA-PANNATTI), The Pali Text Society, Lancaster, 2006, page vii.&lt;/ref&gt; The Puggala-paññatti gives a very broad array of personal descriptors organized in 10 groups, so that the first group is 50 ''single'' descriptors, the second group is 26 ''pairs'' of descriptors, the third 17 ''triplets'', and so on.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramakrishna Rao, Anand C. Paranjpe, Psychology in the Indian Tradition, page 159&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptors include "one competent in watchfulness", "one of perturbable nature", "the wrathful and the vengeful", "the jealous and the avaricious", a "member of the elect ([[arhat]])" etc. 

In the [[Visuddhimagga]] (Path of Purification), the scholar [[Buddhaghosa]] outlines several types of personalities, each one dominated by a particular trait. The three major negative traits which condition a personality are grasping, aversion, and delusion (''lobha'', ''dosa'', and ''moha''), also known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]], and prescribes certain meditation practices for each type. He also outlines three main positive personality traits, confidence ([[Faith in Buddhism|saddha]]), wisdom ([[pañña]]), and speculation. 

===Mahayana===
The Buddhist scholar [[Asanga]] outlined seven personality types in his ''Levels of Listeners'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Inner Science of Buddhist Practice:Vasubandhu's Summary of the Five Heaps with Commentary by Sthiramati, translated by Artemus B. Engle|author=Vasubandhu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0VBgAAQBAJ|date=2015|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-1-55939-920-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#One with a strong tendency for desire, the best initial meditation for them is [[Patikulamanasikara|unattractiveness]] 
#One with a strong tendency for hatred, the best meditation for them is  [[metta|good-will]]
#One with a strong tendency for ignorance, the best meditation for them is [[dependent origination]]
#One with a strong tendency for pride, the best meditation for them is  'diversity of the constituents' 
#One with a strong tendency for discursive thoughts, the best meditation for them is  [[anapanasati|breath meditation]]
#One who is equally and moderately disposed for all mental afflictions, they may begin with any meditation
#One with mental afflictions that are not very strong, they may also begin with any meditation

===Vajrayana===
[[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses the model of the [[Five Tathagatas|Five Buddha families]] for describing an individual's personality. Chogyam Trungpa said of this psychological model:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The buddha family or families associated with a person describe his or her fundamental style, that person's intrinsic perspective or stance in perceiving the world and working with it. Each family is associated with both a neurotic and an enlightened style. The neurotic expression of any buddha family can be transmuted into its wisdom or enlightened aspect. As well as describing people's styles, the buddha families are also associated with colors, elements, landscapes, directions, seasons-with any aspect of the phenomenal world.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The five main families are:
*Buddha family, associated with the wisdom of all encompassing space and the defilement of ignorance
*[[Vajra]] family, associated with the mirror like wisdom and the defilement of anger
*Ratna (jewel), associated with the wisdom of equanimity and the defilement of pride
*Padma (lotus), associated with the wisdom of discriminating awareness and the defilement of passion
*[[Karma]], associated with all accomplishing wisdom and the defilement of envy/paranoia

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7458">[[File:2 parallel footprints.png|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==
[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|left|Left and [[right-hand rule]]s in three dimensions]]
{| class=wikitable align=right
|+ The [[tetromino]]s S and Z are enantiomorphs in 2-dimensions
![[File:Tetromino S.svg|100px]]&lt;BR&gt;S
![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]&lt;BR&gt;Z
|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral&lt;!--sic!--&gt; if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto Av+b&lt;/math&gt; with an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is either 1 or &amp;minus;1 then. If it is &amp;minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition of chirality.

==Chirality in three dimensions==
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.1.svg|thumb|Pair of chiral [[dice]] (enantiomorphs)]]
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[mirror plane of symmetry]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', an inversion center of symmetry ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', or a higher [[improper rotation]] (rotoreflection) ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. Symmetry operations and symmetry elements|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)&lt;/math&gt; and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.&lt;br&gt;This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
First proposed by [[James Bieri]] in 1955.&lt;ref name='bell.2004'/&gt;

==In psychology==
{{More footnotes|date=April 2010}}
Cognitive complexity is a [[psychological]] characteristic or psychological variable that indicates how complex or simple is the [[framing (social sciences)|frame]] and [[perception|perceptual]] skill of a person. A person who is measured high on [[cognitive]] complexity tends to perceive nuances and subtle differences which a person with a lower measure, indicating a less complex cognitive [[structure]] for the task or activity, does not.
{{Quote box |quote=an aspect of a person's cognitive functioning which at one end is defined by the use of many constructs with many relationships to one another (complexity) and at the other end by the use of few constructs with limited relationships to one another (simplicity) |source=[[Lawrence Pervin]], ''Personality''&lt;ref name='Rauterberg'/&gt; |width=33% |align=right}}

It is used as part of one of the several variations of the viable non-empirical evaluation model [[GOMS]] (goals, operators, methods, and selection rules); in particular the [[GOMS/CCT]] methodology.

Cognitive complexity can have various meanings:
* the number of mental structures we use, how abstract they are, and how elaborately they interact to shape our perceptions.
* "an individual-difference variable associated with a broad range of communication skills and related abilities ... [which] indexes the degree of differentiation, articulation, and integration within a cognitive system".&lt;ref&gt;Burleson, B.R., &amp; Caplan, S.E. (1998), "Cognitive complexity". In J.C. McCroskey, J.A. Daly, M.M. Martin, &amp; M.J. Beatty (Eds.), ''Communication and personality: Trait perspectives'' (233–286). Creskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer science==
{{further|Complexity}}
In [[human–computer interaction]], cognitive (or psychological) complexity distinguishes human factors (related to [[psychology]] and human cognition) from, for example, [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].&lt;ref name=thomas:2008&gt;{{cite book |first1=John C. |last1=Thomas |first2=John T. |last2=Richards |editor-last=Sears |editor-first=Andrew |editor2-last=Jacko |editor2-first=Julie A. |chapter=Achieving Psychological Simplicity: Methods And Measures To Reduce Cognitive Complexity |year=2008 |pages=498–507 |title=The human–computer interaction handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies and Emerging Applications |edition=2nd |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |url=http://www.isrc.umbc.edu/HCIHandbook/ |isbn=978-0-8058-5870-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In artificial intelligence==

In an attempt to explain how humans perceive relevance, cognitive complexity is defined as an extension of the notion of [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. It amounts to the length of the shortest description ''available to the observer''.
Here is an example :
Individuating a particular Inuit woman among one hundred people is simpler in a village in Congo rather than in an Inuit village.

Cognitive complexity is related to probability (see [[Simplicity theory]]): situations are cognitively improbable if they are simpler to describe than to generate.
Human individuals attach two complexity values to events:
* description complexity (see above definition)
* generation complexity: the size of the minimum set of parameter values that the 'world' (as imagined by the observer) needs to generate the event.

To 'generate' an event such as an encounter with an Inuit woman in Congo, one must add up the complexity of each event in the causal chain that brought her there. The significant gap between both complexities (hard to produce, easy to describe) makes the encounter improbable and thus narratable.

==Related terms==
Related to cognitive complexity is the term '''behavioral complexity''', used by some researchers in [[organizational studies]], [[organizational culture]] and [[management]].&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Hooijberg, ''Behavioral complexity and managerial effectiveness: a new perspective on managerial leadership'', University of Michigan, 1992; [[Daniel R. Denison]], Robert Hooijberg, Robert E.

==History==
The concept of Digital Business Ecosystem was put forward in 2002 by a group of European researchers and practitioners, including Francesco Nachira, Paolo Dini and Andrea Nicolai, who applied the general notion of digital ecosystems to model the process of adoption and development of ICT-based products and services in competitive, highly fragmented markets like the European one&lt;ref&gt;F Nachira, P Dini, A Nicolai.

. Elizabeth Chang, [[Ernesto Damiani]] and Tharam Dillon started in 2007 the IEEE Digital EcoSystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST). [http://spider.sigappfr.org/members/richard-chbeir/ Richard Chbeir], Youakim Badr, Dominique Laurent, and Hiroshi Ishikawa started in 2009 the ACM [http://sigappfr.acm.org/MEDES Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES)]

==Perspectives==
The digital ecosystem metaphor and models have been applied to a number of business areas related to the production and distribution of knowledge-intensive products and services, including higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Damiani E., Uden, L, &amp; Trisnawaty W. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4233689/ The future of E-learning: E-learning ecosystem.] Inaugural IEEE Digital Ecosystems and Technologies Conference (IEEE DEST), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective of this research is providing methods and tools to achieve a set of objectives of the ecosystem (e.g. sustainability, fairness, bounded information asymmetry, risk control and gracious failure). These objectives are seen as desirable properties whose emergence should be fostered by the digital ecosystem self-organization, rather than as explicit design goals like in conventional IT.

The '''East Pole–West Pole divide''' in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] is an intellectual schism between researchers subscribing to the [[psychological nativism|nativist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] schools of thought.  The term arose from the fact that much of the theory and research supporting [[psychological nativism|nativism]], [[modularity of mind]], and [[computational theory of mind]] originated at several universities located on the East Coast, including [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[Tufts University]]. Conversely, much of the research and theory supporting [[empiricism]], [[emergentism]], and [[embodied cognition]] originated at several universities located on the West Coast, including the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Salk Institute]], and, most notably, the [[University of California, San Diego]].  In reality, the divide is not so clear, with many universities and scholars on both coasts (as well as the Midwest and around the world) supporting each position, as well as more moderate positions in between the two extremes.  The phrase was coined by [[Jerry Fodor]] at an [[MIT]] conference on [[cognition]], at which he referred to another researcher as a "West Coast theorist," apparently unaware that the researcher worked at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blank Slate:The Modern Denial of Human Nature |last=Pinker |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few researchers adhere strictly to the extreme positions highlighted by the East Pole–West Pole debate.  That is, there are very few empiricists who believe in the [[John Locke|Lockean]] ideal of the ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (namely, that children are born with no innate knowledge or constraints), and there are very few nativists who agree with [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor's]] assertion that all concepts that are learned over the course of life are present in the mind prior to birth.  Nevertheless, most scholars within the fields of [[cognitive science]] and [[developmental psychology]] affiliate themselves with one of the two positions through the means of their research.

The two books best known for espousing the empiricist and nativist positions within the context of cognitive psychology are ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]'' by [[Jeffrey Elman]] et al. and ''[[The Modularity of Mind]]'' by [[Jerry Fodor]], respectively.  Incidentally, the authors are affiliated with the two institutions on which the East Pole–West Pole metaphor is based, [[UCSD]] and [[MIT]], affirming the relevance and pervasiveness of this moniker for the intellectual divide.

'''Emptiness''' as a [[human condition]] is a sense of generalized [[boredom]], [[social alienation]] and [[apathy]]. Feelings of emptiness often accompany [[dysthymia]],&lt;ref&gt;Downs, A. The Half-Empty Heart: A supportive guide to breaking free from chronic discontent. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[loneliness]], [[anhedonia]],
[[wiktionary:despair|despair]], or other mental/emotional disorders, including [[schizoid personality disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post trauma]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].  A sense of emptiness is also part of a natural process of [[grief]], as resulting of [[wikt:separation|separation]], [[death]] of a loved one, or other significant changes. However, the particular meanings of “emptiness” vary with the particular context and the religious or cultural tradition in which it is used.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186253/emptiness#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=emptiness%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=emptiness (mysticism) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Christianity and Western sociologists and psychologists view a state of emptiness as a negative, unwanted condition, in some Eastern philosophies such as [[Buddhist philosophy]] and [[Taoism]], emptiness ([[Śūnyatā]]) represents seeing through the illusion of independent self-nature.

==In Western culture==

===Sociology, philosophy, and psychology===
In the West, feeling "empty" is often viewed as a negative condition. Psychologist Clive Hazell, for example, attributes feelings of emptiness to problematic family backgrounds with abusive relationships and mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Adams, Ivan Fras, "Beginning Child Psychiatry", page 208. Brunner Routledge (UK), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that some people who are facing a sense of emptiness try to resolve their painful feelings by becoming addicted to a drug or obsessive activity (be it compulsive sex, gambling or work) or engaging in "frenzied action" or violence. In sociology, a sense of emptiness is associated with [[social alienation]] of the individual. This sense of alienation may be suppressed while working, due to the routine nature of work tasks, but during leisure hours or during the weekend, people may feel a sense of "existential vacuum" and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |website=Mind NC |date=2012-02-16 |title=Existentialism A Brief Overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043502/http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In political philosophy, emptiness is associated with [[nihilism]]. Literary critic [[Georg Lukács]] (born in 1885) argued against the "spiritual emptiness and moral inadequacy of capitalism", and argued in favour of communism as an "entirely new type of civilization, one that promised a fresh start and an opportunity to lead a meaningful and purposeful life."&lt;ref&gt;We Didn't Start the Fire: Capitalism and Its Critics, Then and Now. By Sheri Berman, in Foreign Affairs. http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20030701fareviewessay15413/sheri-berman/we-didn-t-start-the-fire-capitalism-and-its-critics-then-and-now.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "emptiness" was important to a "certain type of [[existentialist]] philosophy and some forms of the [[Death of God]] movement".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Existentialism, the "philosophic movement that gives voice to the sense of alienation and despair", comes from "man’s recognition of his fundamental aloneness in an indifferent universe". People whose response to the sense of emptiness and aloneness is to give excuses live in bad faith; "people who face the emptiness and accept responsibility aim to live 'authentic' lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~dougt/exist.htm |title=Existentialism |publisher=Personal.georgiasouthern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216210805/http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~dougt/exist.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialists argue that "man lives in alienation from God, from nature, from other men, from his own true self." Crowded into cities, working in mindless jobs, and entertained by light mass media, we "live on the surface of life", so that even "people who seemingly have 'everything' feel empty, uneasy, discontented."&lt;ref name=mrjeffrey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrjeffrey.com/English%20IV/Existentialism/A_Primer_of_Existentialism.doc |website=iClass Zone |title=A Primer of Existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures where a sense of emptiness is seen as a negative psychological condition, it is often associated with depression. As such, many of the same treatments are proposed: [[psychotherapy]], group therapy, or other types of counselling. As well, people who feel empty may be advised to keep busy and maintain a regular schedule of work and social activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Other solutions which have been proposed to reduce a sense of emptiness are getting a [[pet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petnet.com.au/releases/17121999.html Petnet - Responsible Ownership in Australia - And then there were two!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalo.edu/reporter/vol28/vol28n25/f1.html Mar. 27, 1997-Vol28n25: Research provides further evidence that pets, music effective at reducing stress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or trying [[Animal-Assisted Therapy]]; getting involved in [[spirituality]] such as [[meditation]] or [[religion|religious]] rituals and service; [[Volunteering|volunteer]]ing to fill time and bring social contact; doing [[social interaction]]s, such as community activities, clubs, or outings; or finding a hobby or recreational activity to regain their interest in life.

===Christianity===
In Austrian philosopher/educator [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s (1861–1925) thinking, spiritual emptiness was a major problem in the educated European middle class. In his 1919 lectures he argued that European culture became "empty of spirit" and "ignorant of the needs, the conditions, that are essential for the life of the spirit". People experienced a "spiritual emptiness"  and their thinking became marked by a "lazy passivity" due to the "absence of will from the life of thought". In modern Europe, Steiner claimed that people would "allow their thoughts to take possession of them", and these thoughts were increasingly filled with abstraction and "pure, natural scientific thinking". The educated middle classes began to think in a way that was "devoid of spirit", with their minds becoming "dimmer and darker", and increasing empty of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/SpiEmp_index.html |title=Lecture: Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date=1919-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Dupré, a Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, argues that the "spiritual emptiness of our time is a symptom of its religious poverty". He claims that "many people never experience any emptiness: they are too busy to feel much absence of any kind"; they only realize their spiritual emptiness if "painful personal experiences -- the death of a loved one, the collapse of a marriage, the alienation of a child, the failure of a business" shock them into reassessing their sense of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE SURVIVAL OF CHRISTIANITY:

Spiritual emptiness has been associated with juvenile violence. In John C. Thomas' 1999 book ''How Juvenile Violence Begins: Spiritual Emptiness'', he argues that youth in impoverished indigenous communities who feel empty may turn to fighting and aggressive crime to fill their sense of meaninglessness. In Cornell University professor [[James Garbarino]]'s 1999 book ''Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'', he argues that "neglect, shame, spiritual emptiness, alienation, anger and access to guns are a few of the elements common to violent boys". A professor of human development, Garbarino claims that violent boys have an "alienation from positive role models" and "a spiritual emptiness that spawns despair". These youth are seduced by the violent fantasy of the US gun culture, which provides negative role models of tough, aggressive men who use power to get what they want. He claims that boys can be helped by giving them "a sense of purpose" and "spiritual anchors" that can "anchor boys in empathy and socially engaged moral thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |title=Cornell News: "Lost Boys" about teen violence |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=1999-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617200955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual emptiness is often connected with addiction, especially by Christian-influenced addiction organizations and counsellors. Bill Wilson, the founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], argued that one of the impacts of alcoholism was causing a spiritual emptiness in heavy drinkers. In Abraham J. Twerski's 1997 book ''Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception'', he argues that when people feel spiritually empty, they often turn to addictive behaviors to fill the inner void. In contrast to having an empty stomach, which is a clear feeling, having spiritual emptiness is hard to identify, so it fills humans with a "vague unrest".  While people may try to resolve this emptiness by obsessively having sex, overeating, or taking drugs or alcohol, these addictions only give temporary satisfaction. When a person facing a crisis due to feeling spiritually empty is able to stop one addiction, such as compulsive sex, they often just trade it in for another addictive behaviour, such as gambling or overeating.&lt;ref&gt;Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception By Abraham J. Twerski Published by Hazelden, 1997

===Fiction, film, design and visual arts===
A number of novelists and filmmakers have depicted emptiness. The concept of "emptiness" was important to a "good deal of 19th–20th century Western imaginative literature".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Novelist [[Franz Kafka]] depicted a meaningless bizarre world in ''[[The Trial]]'' and the [[existentialism|existentialist]] French authors sketched a world cut off from purpose or reason in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[La Nausée]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'étranger]]''. Existentialism influenced 20th century poet [[T.S. Eliot]], whose poem “[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]”  describes an "anti-hero or alienated soul, running away from or confronting the emptiness of his or her existence". Professor Gordon Bigelow argues that the existentialist theme of "spiritual barrenness is commonplace in literature of the 20th century", which in addition to Eliot includes [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner, Steinbeck and Anderson.&lt;ref name=mrjeffrey/&gt;

Film adaptations of a number of existentialist novels capture the bleak sense of emptiness espoused by Sartre and Camus. This theme of emptiness has also been used in modern screenplays. [[Mark Romanek]]'s 1985 film ''[[Static (1986 film)|Static]]'' tells the surreal story of a struggling inventor and crucifix factory worker named Ernie who feels spiritually empty because he is saddened by his parents' death in an accident. Screenwriter Michael Tolkin's 1994 film ''[[The New Age (film)|The New Age]]'' examines "cultural hipness and spiritual emptiness", creating a "dark, ambitious, unsettling" film that depicts a fashionable LA couple who "are miserable in the midst of their sterile plenty", and whose souls are stunted by their lives of empty sex, consumption, and distractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lisa Schwarzbaum|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303914,00.html |title=The New Age Review  |publisher=EW.com |date=1994-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' examines the spiritual emptiness of life in the US suburbs. In [[Wes Anderson]]'s 2007 film ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'', three brothers who "... suffer from spiritual emptiness" and then "self-medicate themselves through sex, social withdrawal, and drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dibben |first=Chance |url=http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/nov/01/movie_review/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070422033055/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/nov/01/movie_review/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-04-22 |title=Movie review |publisher=Kansan.com |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2012-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The 2008 film ''[[The Informers (2008 film)|The Informers]]'' is a [[Hollywood]] [[drama]] film written by [[Bret Easton Ellis]] and [[Nicholas Jarecki]] and directed by [[Gregor Jordan]]. The film is based on Ellis' 1994 collection of short stories of the [[The Informers|same name]]. The film, which is set amidst the decadence of the early 1980s, depicts an assortment of socially alienated, mainly well-off characters who numb their sense of emptiness with casual sex, alcohol, and drugs. 

Contemporary architecture critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] argues that "[[horror vacui]]" (which is Latin for "fear of emptiness") is a key principle of design. He claims that it has become an obsessive quality that is the "driving force in contemporary American taste". Muschamp states that "along with the commercial interests that exploit this interest, it is the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban spaces, and even suburban sprawl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |title=ArtLex's Ho-Hz page |publisher=Artlex.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films that depict nothingness, shadows and vagueness, either in a visual sense or a moral sense are appreciated in genres such as [[film noir]]. As well, travellers and artists are often intrigued by and attracted to vast empty spaces, such as open deserts, barren wastelands or salt flats, and the open sea.

In visual arts emptiness and absence were recognized as phenomena that characterize not only particular works of [[art]] (e.g. [[Yves Klein]]) but also as a more general tendency within the history of [[modern art]] and [[aesthetics]]. Following [[Davor Džalto]]'s argument on the modern concept of art, the gradual elimination of particular elements that traditionally characterized [[visual arts]], which results in emptiness, is the most important phenomenon within the history and [[theory of art]] over the past two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instifdt.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Davor-Dzalto.pdf |title=Art: A Brief History of Absence (From the Conception and Birth, Life and Death, to the Living Deadness of Art) |publisher=Davor Džalto |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Eastern cultures==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Śūnyatā}}
The Buddhist term ''emptiness'' (Skt. ''[[śūnyatā]]'') refers specifically to the idea that everything is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], including the causes and conditions themselves, and even the principle of causality itself.  It is not [[nihilism]], nor is it meditating on nothingness.&lt;ref name=lamazopa&gt;Interview on Emptiness by Lama Zopa Rinpoche. Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/lamazopa/interview.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, it refers to the absence (emptiness) of inherent existence.  [[Buddhapalita]] says:
{{cquote |What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|30px|30px|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}} P5242,73.5.6-74.1.2{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002}}}}

In an interview, the [[Dalai Lama]] stated that [[Tantra|tantric meditation]] can be used for "heightening your own realization of emptiness or [[bodhichitta|mind of enlightenment]]".&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism with His Holiness the Dalai Lama''. Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/survey.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], attaining a realization of emptiness of inherent existence is key to the permanent cessation of [[suffering]], i.e. [[nirvana|liberation]].

{{cquote|Even while an ordinary being, if upon hearing of emptiness great joy arises within again and again, the eyes moisten with tears of great joy, and the hairs of the body stand on end, such a person has the seed of the mind of a complete Buddha; He is a vessel for teachings on [[tattva|thatness]], and ultimate truth should be taught to him. After that, good qualities will grow in him.|30px|30px|[[Chandrakirti]]|''Guide to the Middle Way,'' vv. 6:4-5&lt;ref&gt;translation in ''Ocean of Nectar'', pp. 151, 153&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Dalai Lama argues that tantric [[yoga]] trainees need to realize the emptiness of inherent existence before they can go on to the "highest yoga tantra initiation"; realizing the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind is the "fundamental innate mind of clear light, which is the subtlest level of the mind", where all "energy and mental processes are withdrawn or dissolved", so that all that appears to the mind is "pure emptiness". As well, emptiness is "linked to the creative Void, meaning that it is a state of complete receptivity and perfect enlightenment", the merging of the "ego with its own essence", which Buddhists call the "clear light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotinus.com/spiritual%20emptiness_copy.htm |title=About Spiritual Emptiness or the Void |publisher=Plotinus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ven. Thubten Chodron's 2005 interview with Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the lama noted that we "...ordinary beings who haven't realized emptiness don't see things as similar to illusions", and we do not "realize that things are merely labeled by mind and exist by mere name".&lt;ref name=lamazopa/&gt; He argues that "when we meditate on emptiness, we drop an atom bomb on this [sense of a] truly existent I" and we realize that "what appears true... isn't true". By this, the lama is claiming that what we think is real—our thoughts and feelings about people and things—"exists by being merely labeled". He argues that meditators who attain knowledge of a state of emptiness are able to realize that their thoughts are merely illusions from labelling by the mind.&lt;ref name=lamazopa/&gt;

===Taoism===
In [[Taoism]], attaining a state of emptiness is viewed as a state of stillness and placidity which is the "mirror of the universe" and the "pure mind".&lt;ref name=taopage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taopage.org/emptiness.html |title=Taoism - Wu - Emptiness |publisher=Taopage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tao Te Ching]] claims that emptiness is related to the "Tao, the Great Principle, the Creator and Sustainer of everything in the universe". It is argued that it is the "state of mind of the Taoist disciple who follows the Tao", who has successfully emptied the mind "of all wishes and ideas not fitted with the Tao's Movement". For a person who attains a state of emptiness, the "still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all things", a state of "vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action" which is the "perfection of the Tao and its characteristics, the "mirror of the universe" and the "pure mind".&lt;ref name=taopage/&gt; In this significance, emptiness is the central theme of the artworks by the contemporary Australian artist [[David Booker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">'''Endogenosymbiosis''' is an [[evolution]]ary process, proposed by the evolutionary and environmental biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, in which "gene carriers" ([[virus]]es, [[retrovirus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s) and symbiotic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]) could share parts or all of their [[genome]]s in an endogenous symbiotic relationship with their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-endogenosymbiosis-hypothesis.html|title=Two new studies confirm the 'endogenosymbiosis' hypothesis |date=October 2016 |work=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Gatti |first=Roberto Cazzolla |date=2015 |title=A new idea on the evolution of biodiversity |biorxiv=019828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cazzolla Gatti |first=Roberto|date=2016-03-01|title=A conceptual model of new hypothesis on the evolution of biodiversity |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog.2016.71.issue-3/biolog-2016-0032/biolog-2016-0032.xml?format=INT |journal=Biologia |volume=71 |issue=3 |doi=10.1515/biolog-2016-0032 |issn=1336-9563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==

The related process of [[symbiogenesis]] or endosymbiosis was proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. She proposed that this had created the [[eukaryote]]s, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical [[Darwinian]] cycle of [[mutation]], [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic symbiosis from parasites ==
Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at [[Tomsk State University]] (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that "the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the [[parasitism]], also represents the origin of biodiversity". 
In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged "parasitic" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. 
"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process".

This idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the [[punctuated equilibrium theory]] proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].

== Evidence ==
Two independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between [[mammal]]ian hosts and their many viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Henzy, J. E., &amp; Johnson, W. E. 2016. Phylogenetic sleuthing reveals pair of paralogous genes. eLife, 5, e17224&lt;/ref&gt;

David Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive [[amino acid]] changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.&lt;ref&gt;Enard, D., Cai, L., Gwennap, C., &amp; Petrov, D. A. 2016. Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals. eLife, 5, e12469&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous [[retrovirus]]es. This may be an underestimate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in [[bacteriophage]]s. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah R. Bordenstein &amp; Seth R. Bordenstein, Eukaryotic association module in phage WO genomes from Wolbachia, Nature Communications 7, Article number: 13155 (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms13155&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Energy therapy}}
'''Energy medicine''', '''energy therapy''', '''energy healing''', '''psychic healing''', '''spiritual medicine''' or '''spiritual healing''' are branches of [[alternative medicine]] based on a [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] belief that healers can channel healing [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods:  hands-on,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; hands-off,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and distant&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=brockhampton&gt;{{cite book |title= Guide to Spiritual Healing |last= Daulby |first= Martin |first2= Caroline |last2=Mathison |year= 1996 |publisher= Brockhampton Press |isbn= 1-86019-370-6 |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations.

Many schools of energy healing exist using many names, for example, ''biofield energy healing'',&lt;ref name="mdanderson"&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/network/issues/2007-fall/network-fall-2007-energy-medicines-will-east-meet-west-.html | title=Energy Medicines: Will East Meet West? | author1=Network newsletter | author2=MD Anderson Cancer Center | access-date=November 30, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125021822/http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/network/issues/2007-fall/network-fall-2007-energy-medicines-will-east-meet-west-.html | archive-date=November 25, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite web |date=October 2007  | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n772q20j61180nj0/ | title=Biofield Therapies: Helpful or Full of Hype? | work=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine (Volume 17, Number 1, 1–16) | doi=10.1007/s12529-009-9062-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''spiritual healing'',&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A primer of complementary and alternative medicine commonly used by cancer patients |authorlink=Edzard Ernst | journal=Medical Journal of Australia | first=Edzard | last=Ernst | year=2001 | volume=174|issue=2 | pages=88–92|pmid=11245510 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/174_02_150101/ernst/ernst.html#suba10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''contact healing'', ''distant healing'', ''Qi Do'', ''[[therapeutic touch]]'',&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Touch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/ManualHealingandPhysicalTouch/therapeutic-touch |title=Therapeutic Touch |publisher=Cancer.org |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Reiki]]''&lt;ref name="Reiki Practice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/reiki/ |title=Reiki Practice |publisher=Nccih.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Qigong]].''&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;

Not what science considers evidence. And the true believers don’t value evidence or the scientific method: for them, belief is enough.") at sciencebasedmedicine.org] Accessed March 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliance on spiritual and energetic healings is associated with serious harm or death when medical treatment is delayed or foregone.&lt;ref name="whatstheharm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatstheharm.net/energymedicine.html|title=What_is_this_site?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

The term "energy medicine" has been in general use since the founding of the non-profit ''International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine'' in the 1980s. Guides are available for practitioners, and other books aim to provide a theoretical basis and evidence for the practice. Energy medicine often proposes that imbalances in the body's "energy field" result in illness, and that by re-balancing the body's energy-field health can be restored.&lt;ref name="NCCAM"/&gt; Some modalities describe treatments as ridding the body of negative energies or blockages in 'mind'; illness or episodes of ill health after a treatment are referred to as a 'release' or letting go of a 'contraction' in the body-mind. Usually, a practitioner will then recommend further treatments for complete healing.

The US-based ''[[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]'' (NCCIH) distinguishes between health care involving scientifically observable energy, which it calls "Veritable Energy Medicine", and health care methods that invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable [[energy (esotericism)|"energies"]], which it calls "Putative Energy Medicine":&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm | title=Energy Medicine: An Overview | author=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Types of "veritable energy medicine" include [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]], and [[light therapy]]. Medical techniques involving the use electromagnetic radiation (''e.g.'' [[radiation therapy]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]) are not considered "energy medicine" in the terms of alternative medicine.
* Types of "putative energy medicine" include biofield energy healing therapies where the hands are claimed to direct or modulate "energies" which are believed to effect healing in the patient;&lt;ref "name=warber"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Warber, S.

Polarity therapy founded by [[Randolph Stone]] is a kind of energy medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellnessinstitute.net/web/polarity_therapy|title=Polarity Therapy|publisher=Wellness Institute|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the belief that a person's health is subject to positive and negative charges in their electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |pages=235–237 |chapter=Polarity Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been promoted as capable of curing a number of human ailments ranging from muscular tightness to cancer; however, according to the [[American Cancer Society]] "available scientific evidence does not support claims that polarity therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Reiki-Treatment.jpg|thumb|A Reiki practitioner]]
Energy healing relies on a belief in the ability of a practitioner to channel healing energy into the person seeking help by different methods: hands-on,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; hands-off,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and distant&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name="brockhampton"/&gt; (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. The ''Brockhampton Guide to Spiritual Healing'' describes contact healing in terms of "transfer of ... healing energy" and distant healing based on visualising the patient in perfect health.&lt;ref name="brockhampton"/&gt; Practitioners say that this "healing energy" is sometimes perceived by the therapist as a feeling of heat.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article4317985.ece|author=Jules Evans | title=Spiritual healing on the NHS? | publisher=The Times|date=July 14, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various schools of energy healing, including ''biofield energy healing'',&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink"/&gt; ''spiritual healing'',&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; ''contact healing'', ''distant healing'', ''[[therapeutic touch]]'',&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Touch"/&gt; ''[[Reiki]],''&lt;ref name="Reiki Practice"/&gt; ''[[Qigong]],'' and many others.&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;

''Spiritual healing'' is largely non-denominational; traditional religious faith is not seen as a prerequisite for effecting a cure. ''[[Faith healing]],'' by contrast, takes place within a religious context.&lt;ref name="What is healing"/&gt; The Buddha is often quoted by practitioners of energy medicine, but he did not practise "hands on or off" healing.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Energy healing techniques such as [[Therapeutic touch]] have found recognition in the nursing profession. In 2005–2006, the ''[[North American Nursing Diagnosis Association]]'' approved the diagnosis of "[[energy field disturbance]]" in patients, reflective of what has been variously called a "[[postmodernism|postmodern]]" or "anti-scientific" approach to nursing care. This approach has been strongly criticised.&lt;ref name=Glazer&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/postmodern-nursing|year=2000|title=Postmodern nursing | author=Sarah Glazer | work=National Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammer | first = Owen | authorlink = |author2=James Underdown  | title = State-Sponsored Quackery: Feng Shui and Snake Oil for California Nurses  | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]  | volume = 33  | issue = 6  | pages = 53–56 | publisher = Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/state-sponsored_quackery_feng_shui_and_snake_oil_for_california_nurses/ | date = November–December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Junk&gt;[http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2007/07/junkfood-science-special-trusting.html Junkfood Science Special: Trusting nurses with our lives] by Sandy Szwarc, BSN, RN, CCP.

Believers in these techniques have proposed [[Quantum mysticism|quantum mystical]] invocations of [[Quantum nonlocality|non-locality]] to try to explain distant healing.&lt;ref name=AAQM&gt;{{cite web | title=Some Notes on the American Academy of Quantum Medicine (AAQM) | author=Stephen Barrett | url=http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aaqm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also proposed that healers act as a channel passing on a kind of [[bioelectromagnetism]] which shares similarities to [[vitalism|vitalistic]] [[pseudosciences]] such as [[orgone]] or [[qi]].&lt;ref name="stenger"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Victor J.

Writing in the ''Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies'', James Oschman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Oschman | first1=James L. | doi=10.1016/S1360-8592(97)80038-1 | title=What is healing energy?

Oschman believes that "healing energy" derives from [[frequency|electromagnetic frequencies]] generated by a medical device, projected from the hands of the healer, or by [[electron]]s acting as [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oschman|first1=James|title=Can Electrons Act as Antioxidants?

Physicists and sceptics roundly criticise these explanations as [[pseudophysics]]&amp;nbsp;– a branch of [[pseudoscience]] which explains [[magical thinking]] by using irrelevant jargon from modern physics to exploit [[scientific literacy|scientific illiteracy]] and to impress the unsophisticated.&lt;ref name=GistLubin&gt;{{cite book|title=Response to disaster: psychosocial, community, and ecological approaches in clinical and community psychology|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=0-87630-998-8|page=291|author1=Richard Gist |author2=Bernard Lubin }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, even enthusiastic supporters of energy healing point out that "there are only very tenuous theoretical foundations underlying [spiritual] healing."&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=88|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|issue=4 | year=1995 | pages=203–207 | title=Is spiritual healing a valid and effective therapy? |author1=Hodges, RD  |author2=Scofield, AM |pmid=7745566|pmc=1295164}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific investigations==

===Distant healing===

A systematic review of 23 trials of distant healing published in 2000 did not draw definitive conclusions because of the "methodologic limitations of several studies".&lt;ref name=Astin&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Efficacy of "Distant Healing: A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=2000|last=Astin|first=J.|author2=et. al|volume=132|issue=11|pages=903–910 | url=http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract|pmid=10836918|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-11-200006060-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the lead author of that study, [[Edzard Ernst]], published a primer on complementary therapies in cancer care in which he explained that though "about half of these trials suggested that healing is effective" he cautioned that the evidence was "highly conflicting" and that "methodological shortcomings prevented firm conclusions." He concluded that "as long as it is not used as an alternative to effective therapies, spiritual healing should be virtually devoid of risks."&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92" /&gt;  A 2001 randomised clinical trial by the same group found no statistically significant difference on chronic pain between distance healers and "simulated healers".&lt;ref name=Abbot&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00421-8 | last1=Abbot | title=Spiritual healing as a therapy for chronic pain: a randomized, clinical trial | first1=NC | last2=Harkness | first2=EF | last3=Stevinson | first3=C | last4=Marshall | first4=FP | last5=Conn | first5=DA | last6=Ernst | first6=E. |authorlink6=Edzard Ernst | author9=Abbot, NC, Harkness, EF, Stevinson, C, Marshall, FP, Conn, DA and Ernst, E. | journal=Pain | volume=91 | issue=1–2 | year=2001 | pages=79–89|pmid=11240080}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 review by Ernst updating previous work concluded that more recent research had shifted the weight of evidence "against the notion that distant healing is more than a placebo" and that "distant healing can be associated with adverse effects."&lt;ref name=Ernst2003&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF03040322 | author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst | title=Distant healing—an update of a systematic review | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr. | year=2003 | volume=115 | issue=7–8 | pages=241–245 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h852m82147632728/ | pmid=12778776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact healing===
A 2001 randomised clinical trial randomly assigned 120 patients with chronic pain to either healers or "simulated healers", but could not demonstrate efficacy for either distance or face-to-face healing.&lt;ref name="Abbot"/&gt; A systematic review in 2008 concluded that the evidence for a specific effect of spiritual healing on relieving neuropathic or neuralgic pain was not convincing.&lt;ref name=Pittler&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e3181759231 | last1=Pittler | first1=MH | last2=Ernst | first2=E. |authorlink2=Edzard Ernst | author9=Pittler, MH.; Ernst, E. | title=Complementary Therapies for Neuropathic and Neuralgic Pain: Systematic Review | journal=Clinical Journal of Pain. | volume=24 | issue=8 | pages=731–733 | year=2008 | pmid=18806539}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'', [[Simon Singh]] and [[Edzard Ernst]] concluded that "spiritual healing is biologically implausible and its effects rely on a placebo response. At best it may offer comfort; at worst it can result in charlatans taking money from patients with serious conditions who require urgent conventional medicine."&lt;ref name=TrickOrTreatment&gt;{{Cite book| title=[[Trick or Treatment]] | year=2008 | publisher= W.

===Evidence base===

Alternative medicine researcher Edzard Ernst has argued that although an initial review of pre-1999 distant healing trials&lt;ref name=Astin/&gt; had highlighted 57% of trials as showing positive results,&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; later reviews of non-randomised and randomised clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2002&lt;ref name=Ernst2003/&gt; led to the conclusion that "the majority of the rigorous trials do not support the hypothesis that distant healing has specific therapeutic effects". Ernst described the evidence base for healing practices to be "increasingly negative".&lt;ref name=ernst2006&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2006.07.010 |title=Spiritual healing: more than meets the eye |author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage. |date=November 2006 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=393–5 |pmid=17085260 | url=http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(06)00524-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst also warned that many of the reviews were under suspicion for fabricated data, lack of transparency, and scientific misconduct. He concluded that "[s]piritual healing continues to be promoted despite the absence of biological plausibility or convincing clinical evidence ... that these methods work therapeutically and plenty to demonstrate that they do not."&lt;ref name=ernst2006/&gt; A 2014 study of energy healing for colorectal cancer patients showed no improvement in quality of life, depressive symptoms, mood, or sleep quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=CG Pedersen |author2=H Johannessen |author3=JV Hjelmborg |author4=R Zachariae |title=Effectiveness of energy healing on Quality of Life: a pragmatic intervention trial in colorectal cancer patients|journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine|date=June 2014|volume=22|issue=3|pages=463–72|pmid=24906586|doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2014.04.003}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 5, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations for positive reports==
There are several, primarily psychological, explanations for positive reports after energy therapy, including [[placebo effect]]s, [[spontaneous remission]], and [[cognitive dissonance]]. A 2009 review found that the "small successes" reported for two therapies collectively marketed as "energy psychology" ([[Emotional Freedom Techniques]] and [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]]) "are potentially attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation." The report concluded that "[p]sychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims."&lt;ref name=McCaslin&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago) |date=June 2009 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |title=A review of efficacy claims in energy psychology |author=McCaslin DL |pmid=22122622 |doi=10.1037/a0016025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural.&lt;ref name='USDMoores1'&gt;{{Cite news| title=Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Cancer Patients: Faith Healing | publisher=Moores UCSD Cancer Center | url =http://cancer.ucsd.edu/Outreach/PublicEducation/CAMs/faith.asp | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-17 | language = }} "Benefits may result because of the natural progression of the illness, rarely but regularly occurring spontaneous remission or through the placebo effect."&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'', meaning that a genuine improvement or [[spontaneous remission]] may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the [[placebo]] effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the healer{{spaced ndash}} not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Park | first = Robert L. | authorlink = Robert L.

Both cases, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

Positive findings from research studies can also result from such psychological mechanisms, or as a result of [[experimenter bias]], methodological flaws such as lack of [[Blind experiment|blinding]],&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt; or [[publication bias]]; positive reviews of the scientific literature may show [[selection bias]], in that they omit key studies that do not agree with the author's position.&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pignotti&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pignotti, M.  |author2=Thyer, B. | year=2009 | title=Some comments on "Energy psychology: A review of the evidence": Premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence? | journal=Psychotherapy: Research, Practice, Training | volume=46 | pages=257–261 | doi = 10.1037/a0016027 | issue = 2 | pmid=22122623}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors must be considered when evaluating claims.

==Bioresonance therapy==
'''Bioresonance therapy''' (including '''MORA therapy''') is a [[pseudoscientific]] medical practice in which it is proposed that [[electromagnetic wave]]s can be used to diagnose and treat human illness.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2004 171-173"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst |title=Bioresonance, a study of pseudo-scientific language |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed Klass Naturheilkd |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=171–173 |date=June 2004  |pmid=15249751 |doi=10.1159/000079446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and method===
Bioresonance therapy was invented in (Germany) in 1977 by Franz Morell and his son-in-law, engineer Erich Rasche. Initially they marketed it as "MORA-Therapie", for MOrell and RAsche. Some of the machines contain an electronic circuit measuring skin-resistance, akin to the [[E-meter]] used by [[Scientology]], which the bioresonance creators sought to improve; Franz Morell had links with Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.bioenergeticmedicine.org/CoRe-System/Main/FAQ.htm|website=www.bioenergeticmedicine.org|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners claim to be able to detect a variety of diseases and addictions. Some practitioners also claim they can treat diseases using this therapy without drugs, by stimulating a change of "bioresonance" in the cells, and reversing the change caused by the disease. The devices would need to be able to isolate and pinpoint pathogens' responses from the mixture of responses the device receives via the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficacy Study into Bioresonance Therapy|url=https://bioresonance.com/efficacy-study-into-bioresonance-therapy-slides/|publisher=Bioresonance.com|accessdate=November 27, 2016|date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmitting these transformed signals over the same electrodes is claimed by practitioners to generate healing signals that have the curative effect.&lt;ref name=qw /&gt;

===Effectiveness===
One placebo-controlled study of the effects of bioresonance therapy showed that "MORA bioresonance therapy can markedly improve non-organic gastro-intestinal complaints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nienhaus J, Galle M |title=[Placebo-controlled study of the effects of a standardized MORA bioresonance therapy on functional gastrointestinal complaints] |language=German |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |year=2006 |doi=10.1159/000090134 |pmid=16582548}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research study, however, was conducted with a relatively small sample size of 20 people and published by a journal that exclusively publishes "alternative medicine" procedures. The bioresonance diagnosis was complemented by the practitioner's dietary suggestions, making for an uncontrolled experiment with no analytical methods. The only measuring methods present were the subjective analysis of the practitioner pre and post diagnosis.

===Scientific criticism===
Lacking any scientific explanation of how bioresonance therapy might work, researchers have classified bioresonance therapy as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;

Proven cases of online fraud have occurred,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news02/biores.html "BioResonance" Promoter Settles Charges]&lt;/ref&gt; with a practitioner making false claims that he had the ability to cure cancer, and that his clients did not need to follow the chemotherapy or surgery recommended by medical doctors, which can be life-saving.  [[Ben Goldacre]] ridiculed the [[BBC]] when it reported as fact a clinic's claim that the treatment had the ability to stop 70% of clients smoking, a better result than any conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/nov/12/badscience.uknews Who's holding a smoking gun to bioresonance?]

In the United States of America the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) classifies "devices that use resistance measurements to diagnose and treat various diseases" as Class III devices, which require FDA approval prior to marketing.

There are a number of presentations that can be related to domestic violence during pregnancy: delay in seeking care for injuries; late booking, non-attenders at appointments, self-discharge; frequent attendance, vague problems; aggressive or over-solicitous partner; [[Burn (injury)|burns]], pain, tenderness, injuries; vaginal tears, bleeding, [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s; and [[miscarriage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Domestic violence against a pregnant woman can also affect the fetus and can have lingering effects on the child after birth.  Physical abuse is associated with [[neonatal death]] (1.5% versus 0.2%), and verbal abuse is associated with [[low birth weight]] (7.6% versus 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yost, Nicole P. |author2=Bloom, Steven L. |author3=McIntire, Donald D. |author4=Leveno, Kenneth J. |title=A Prospective Observational Study of Domestic Violence During Pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=61–65 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15994618 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000164468.06070.2a |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against men ===
Women's violence towards men is a serious social problem.&lt;ref&gt;In D.R. Loseke, R.J. Gelles &amp; M.M. Cavanaugh (Eds.), Current controversies on family violence (2nd edition, pp. 55–77). Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; While much attention has been focused on domestic violence against women, researchers argue that [[domestic violence against men]] is a substantial social problem worthy of attention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, the issue of victimization of men by women has been contentious, due in part to studies which report drastically different statistics regarding domestic violence.

Some studies—typically crime studies—show that men are substantially more likely than women to use violence.&lt;ref name="Extent"&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/181867.txt Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies—typically family and domestic violence studies—show that men are more likely to inflict injuries, but also that when all acts of physical aggression or violence are considered in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]], women are equally violent as men,&lt;ref&gt;"A review of the research literature indicates that female intimate partner violence (IPV) is a frequent as male IPV. It is just as severe and has much the same consequences for males as for females." Donald G. Dutton."Female intimate partner violence and developmental trajectories of abusive females." ''[[International Journal of Men's Health]]''. Spring 2007. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAU/is_1_6/ai_n27283525/?tag=content;col1]&lt;/ref&gt; or more violent than men.&lt;ref&gt;A 2007 study of over 2,400 Spanish high school students found that girls are substantially more likely than boys to exhibit physical aggression (41.9% vs. 31.7%), including higher rates of hitting/kicking (13.4% vs 5.3%), slapping (12.4% vs 3.1%) and shoving/grabbing (22.5% vs 11.9%). See Munoz-Rivas, M. J., Grana, J. L., O'Leary, K. D., &amp; Gonzalez, M. P. (2007). Aggression in adolescent dating relationships: prevalence, justification, and health consequences. Journal of Adolescent Health, 40, 298–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A 2000 meta analysis found that men inflict 65% of domestic injuries, but women are more likely (d=-.05) to use any act of violence or aggression.

In May 2007, researchers with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported on rates of self-reported violence among intimate partners using data from a 2001 study. In the study, almost one-quarter of participants reported some violence in their relationships. Half of these involved one-sided ("non-reciprocal") attacks and half involved both assaults and counter assaults ("reciprocal violence"). Women reported committing one-sided attacks more than twice as often as men (70% ''versus'' 29%). In all cases of intimate partner violence, women were more likely to be injured than men, but 25% of men in relationships with two-sided violence reported injury compared to 20% of women reporting injury in relationships with one-sided violence. Women were more likely to be injured in non-reciprocal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, D. et al. (2007) Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence. Am J Public Health. 2007 May; 97(5): 941–947. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020, http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray A. Straus|Straus]] argues that these discrepancies between the two data sets are due to several factors. For example, Straus notes that crime studies use different methodologies than family conflict studies.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (1999). "The Controversy Over Domestic Violence by Women". In ''Violence in Intimate Relationships''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Straus notes that most studies show that while men inflict the greater portion of injuries, women are ''at least'' as likely as men to shove, punch, slap or otherwise physically assault their partner, and that such relatively minor assaults often escalate to more serious assaults. Men generally do not report such assaults if asked general questions about violence or abuse; older studies frequently failed to ask about specific actions, thus falling afoul of quite different cultural gender norms for what constitutes abuse. ''Minor'' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The 2000 CDC report, based on phone interviews with 8000 men and 8000 women, reported that 7.5% of men claim to have been raped or assaulted by an intimate at some time in their life (compared to 25% of women), and 0.9 percent of men claim to have been raped or assaulted in the previous 12 months (compared to 1.5% of women).&lt;ref name="Extent"/&gt;

A 2007–2008 online non-random, self-report survey of the experiences and health of men who sustained partner violence in the past year. The study showed that male victims of IPV are very hesitant to report the violence or seek help. Reasons given for non-reporting were they (1) may be ashamed to come forward; (2) may not be believed; and (3) may be accused of being a batterer when they do come forward. The 229 U.S. heterosexual men, between 18 and 59, had been physically assaulted by their female partner within previous year and did seek help. The researchers say their findings emphasize the need for prevention on all levels:

* Primary prevention: Educate public and providers that both sexes can be IPV victims
* Secondary prevention: First responders (police, hotlines, medical professionals) should take concerns seriously from all individuals (including males) seeking help
* Tertiary prevention: Rehabilitative services available to all individuals&lt;ref&gt;Denise A. Hines, Emily M. Douglas.

===Among LGB people===
{{Further|Domestic violence#Same-sex relationships}}
Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples,&lt;ref name="Karmen"/&gt; while other sources state domestic violence among gay and lesbian couples might be higher than among heterosexual couples, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that [[Domestic violence in lesbian relationships|lesbian couples experience domestic violence]] less than heterosexual couples do.&lt;ref name="Hampton"/&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S.

Of this sample of women, 78.2% had been in a prior relationship with a man. Reports of violence by men were all lower than reports of violence in prior relationships with women (sexual victimization, 41.9% (vs. 56.8% with women); physical victimization 32.4% (vs. 45%) and emotional victimization 55.1% (vs. 64.5%)."

When it comes to domestic violence towards children involving physical abuse, research in the UK by the [[NSPCC]] indicated that "most violence occurred at home" (78 per cent). 40—60% of men and women who abuse other adults also abuse their children.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychology Association.

=== Between teenagers ===
{{Main|Teen dating violence}}

{{Globalize/US|date=February 2015}}
Teen dating violence is a pattern of [[controlling behavior]] by one teenager over another teenager who are in a dating relationship. While there are many similarities to "traditional" domestic violence there are also some differences. Teens are much more likely than adults to become isolated from their peers as the result of controlling behavior by their boyfriend/girlfriend. Also, for many teens the abusive relationship may be their first dating experience and have never had a "normal" dating experience with which to compare it. While teenagers are trying to establish their sexual identities, they are also confronting violence in their relationships and exposure to technology. Studies document that teenagers are experiencing significant amounts of dating or domestic violence. Depending on the population studied and the way dating violence is defined, between 9 and 35% of teens have experienced domestic violence in a dating relationship. When a broader definition of abuse that encompasses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is used, one in three teen girls is subjected to dating abuse."&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King-Ries|first=Andrew|title=Teens, Technology, and Cyberstalking: The Domestic Violence Wave of the Future?|journal=Texas Journal of Women and the Law|year=2011|volume=20|pages=131–164|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a significant number of teens are victims of stalking by intimate partners. Although involvement with romantic relationships is a critical aspect of adolescence, these relationships also present serious risks for teenagers. Unfortunately, adolescents in dating relationships are at greater risk of intimate partner violence than any other age group. Approximately one third of adolescent girls are victims of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner. Estimates of sexual victimization range from 14% to 43% of girls and 0.3% to 36% for boys. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2009, nearly 10% of students nationwide had been intentionally hit, slapped, or physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend. Twenty-six percent of girls in a relationship reported being threatened with violence or experiencing verbal abuse; 13% reported being physically hurt or hit.&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"/&gt;

==Measuring==
Measures of the incidence of violence in intimate relationships can differ markedly in their findings depending on the measures used. Care is needed when using domestic violence statistics to ensure that both gender bias and under-reporting issues do not affect the inferences that are drawn from the statistics.

Some researchers, such as Michael P. Johnson, suggest that where and how domestic violence is measured also affects findings, and caution is needed to ensure statistics drawn from one class of situations are not applied to another class of situations in a way that might have fatal consequences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060449/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, such as David Murray Fergusson, counter that domestic violence prevention services, and statistics that they produce, target the extreme end of domestic violence and preventing child abuse rather than domestic violence between couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060442/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender bias===
{{weasel|date=September 2013}}
[[Statistical survey|Survey]] approaches to gathering domestic violence statistics have shown inconsistent results with regard to gender differences. Some surveys have shown comparable levels of violence by both men and women against partners, while other surveys have shown higher levels of violence by men. Approaches using data from reports of domestic violence offenses, for example, agency or hospital samples, tend to show women experiencing violence from male partners as the majority of cases (80–90%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Research based on the [[statistical survey|survey]]-based [[Conflict Tactics Scale]], a measure of intrafamily conflict and violence focusing on the adults in the family developed by Murray Straus (1979){{Clarify|date=May 2008}}, includes national surveys on the prevalence of domestic violence in the United States and other countries. These include the two U.S. National Family Violence Surveys (1975 and 1985)&lt;ref&gt;http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000). The National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) found that women experience more intimate partner violence than do men, women experience more chronic and injurious physical assaults at the hands of intimate partners than do men, and that violence perpetrated against women by intimates is often accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000).

Research based on reported domestic violence or on police records show men to be the perpetrators, and women the victims, of most reported domestic violence. However, the intervention of police may introduce a degree of gender bias into reporting. When faced with an uncertain domestic violence situation, removing one party will often defuse an altercation. Police officers may find it easier to take action against a man. This may be due to gender expectations, reinforced by previous incidents.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} . Additionally, removing the woman may entail involving other social services to care for any existing children for a time, something that may not be in the children's best interests, or may cause a significant delay. The fact that non-domestic offending is often committed by males may also influence an officer's decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Police responding to a complaint may act more favorably to the complainant than other parties (though some researchers report instances where men were attacked, called the police instead of fighting back, yet were arrested themselves). Some researchers have found that women are more likely to report domestic violence to police than men are. In Ireland, 29% of female victims and 5% of male victims of domestic abuse reported the abuse to the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1b&gt;"[http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf 36091 NCC Doc.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202916/http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }}". www.gov.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, male victims are less likely than female victims to report rape, physical assault, or stalking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/181867.pdf Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence (NCJ 181867)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury and hospital admission statistics suggest that males are more frequently the perpetrators of injury causing violence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, both the difference in likelihood of reporting noted above, and the relative strength difference between males and females, could be factors in this reporting bias, as males may be more likely to injure females in otherwise equivalent circumstances.

===Under-reporting===

The problem of [[under-reporting]] to police is believed to be substantial. However, estimates about how much domestic violence is not reported vary widely. It must also be remembered that a significant amount of non-domestic violence crime is also not reported to police. Depending on what statistics are chosen, anywhere between a tenth of incidents and nothing significantly less than what would be expected for any other incident are reported to police.{{Clarify|date=May 2008}}

Many crime victimization surveys, from many countries, do show that there is a correlation between the under-reporting of crime and the degree of intimacy between the victim and the offender. The degree of seriousness of offending also affects reporting, with less serious offending less likely to be reported to police. Also the nature of the offending affects reporting, with sexual offenses far less likely to be reported, even when they are serious.

== International levels ==
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that violence against women is a public health and human rights concern. Work in this area has resulted in the establishment of international standards, but the task of documenting the magnitude of violence against women and producing reliable, comparative data to guide policy and monitor implementation has been exceedingly difficult.

The World Health Organisation Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women 2005 is a response to this difficulty. Published in 2005 it is a groundbreaking study which analysed data from 10 countries and sheds new light on the prevalence of violence against women. It seeks to look at violence against women a public health policy perspective. The findings will be used to inform a more effective response from government, including the health, justice and social service sectors, as a step towards fulfilling the state's obligation to eliminate violence against women under international human rights laws.

===Europe===
[[File:A Russian poster urging open your eyes - against women being abused.jpg|thumb|A Bulgarian poster urging people to open their eyes about domestic violence against women]]

The ''British Crime Survey'' for 2006–2007 reported that 0.5% of people (0.6% of women and 0.3% of men) reported being victims of domestic violence during that year and 44.3% of domestic violence was reported to the police. According to the survey, 312,000 women and 93,000 men were victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf Crime in England and Wales 2006/07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122085133/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf |date=November 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====

In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson N, Nahwegahbow A | year = 2010 | title = Family violence and the need for prevention research in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities.

Results of studies which estimate the prevalence of domestic violence vary significantly, depending on specific wording of survey questions, how the survey is conducted, the definition of abuse or domestic violence used, the willingness or unwillingness of victims to admit that they have been abused and other factors. For instance, Straus (2005) conducted a study which estimated that the rate of minor assaults by women in the United States was 78 per 1,000 couples, compared with a rate for men of 72 per 1,000 and the severe assault rate was 46 per 1,000 couples for assaults by women and 50 per 1,000 for assaults by men. Neither difference is statistically significant. He claimed that since these rates were based exclusively on information provided by women respondents, the near-equality in assault rates could not be attributed to a gender bias in reporting.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"&gt;Straus, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One analysis found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, studies have shown that women are more likely to be injured.

A Canadian study showed that 7% of women and 6% of men were abused by their current or former partners, but female victims of spousal violence were more than twice as likely to be injured as male victims, three times more likely to fear for their life, twice as likely to be stalked, and twice as likely to experience more than ten incidents of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/14/domestic-violence-050714.html |title=CBC News&amp;nbsp;– Canada&amp;nbsp;– Domestic violence rate unchanged, Statistics Canada finds |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Straus notes that Canadian studies on domestic violence have simply excluded questions that ask men about being victimized by their wives.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"/&gt;

According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%, compared with 18% of men to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics show that 34% of women feared for their lives, and 10% of men feared for theirs.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;O'Grady William (2011).

Victims of DV are offered legal remedies, which include the criminal law, as well as obtaining a [[protection order]]. The remedies offered can be both of a civil nature (civil orders of protection and other protective services) and of a criminal nature (charging the perpetrator with a criminal offense). People perpetrating DV are subject to criminal prosecution, most often under assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiacp.org/portals/0/pdfs/ProtectingVictimsOfDV.pdf|title=Protecting Victims of Domestic Violence (U.S.)|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice / International Association of Chiefs of Police |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their
authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7805">In [[mathematics]], an '''exceptional isomorphism''', also called an '''accidental isomorphism''', is an [[isomorphism]] between members ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of two families, usually infinite, of mathematical objects, that is not an example of a pattern of such isomorphisms.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Because these series of objects are presented differently, they are not identical objects (do not have identical descriptions), but turn out to describe the same object, hence one refers to this as an isomorphism, not an equality (identity).&lt;/ref&gt; These coincidences are at times considered a matter of trivia,&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt; but in other respects they can give rise to other phenomena, notably [[exceptional object]]s.&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt; In the following, coincidences are listed wherever they occur.

== Groups ==

=== Finite simple groups ===
The exceptional isomorphisms between the series of [[finite simple group]]s mostly involve [[projective special linear group]]s and [[alternating group]]s, and are:&lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Wilson | first1=Robert A. | authorlink = Robert Arnott Wilson | title=The finite simple groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] 251 | isbn=978-1-84800-987-5 | doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2 | year=2009 |chapter = Chapter 1: Introduction |chapterurl=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs_files/intro.ps | postscript =, [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/fsgs.html 2007 preprint]; Chapter {{doi|10.1007/978-1-84800-988-2_1}}. | zbl=1203.20012 | volume=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(4) \cong \operatorname{PSL}_2(5) \cong \mathfrak{A}_5,&lt;/math&gt; the smallest non-abelian simple group (order 60);
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(7) \cong \operatorname{PSL}_3(2),&lt;/math&gt; the second-smallest non-abelian simple group (order 168) – [[PSL(2,7)]];
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(9) \cong \mathfrak{A}_6,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_4(2) \cong \mathfrak{A}_8,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSU}_4(2) \cong \operatorname{PSp}_4(3),&lt;/math&gt; between a [[projective special orthogonal group]] and a [[projective symplectic group]].

=== Groups of Lie type ===
In addition to the aforementioned, there are some isomorphisms involving SL, PSL, GL, PGL, and the natural maps between these. For example, the groups over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_5&lt;/math&gt; have a number of exceptional isomorphisms:
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,5) \cong \mathfrak{A}_5 \cong \mathbb{I},&lt;/math&gt; the alternating group on five elements, or equivalently the [[icosahedral group]];
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PGL}(2,5) \cong \mathfrak{S}_5,&lt;/math&gt; the [[symmetric group]] on five elements;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SL}(2,5) \cong 2\mathfrak{A}_5 \cong 2\mathbb{I},&lt;/math&gt; the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], or equivalently the [[binary icosahedral group]].

=== Alternating groups and symmetric groups ===
[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|The [[compound of five tetrahedra]] expresses the exceptional isomorphism between the icosahedral group and the alternating group on five letters.]]
There are coincidences between alternating groups and small groups of Lie type:
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(4) \cong \operatorname{PSL}_2(5) \cong \mathfrak{A}_5,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_2(9) \cong \operatorname{Sp}_4(2)' \cong \mathfrak{A}_6,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sp}_4(2) \cong \mathfrak{S}_6,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}_4(2) \cong \operatorname{O}_6^+(2)' \cong \mathfrak{A}_8,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{O}_6^+(2) \cong \mathfrak{S}_8.&lt;/math&gt;
These can all be explained in a systematic way by using linear algebra (and the action of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; on affine &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-space)
to define the isomorphism going from the right side to the left side. (The above isomorphisms for &lt;math&gt;A_8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_8&lt;/math&gt; are linked via the exceptional isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SL}_4/\mu_2 \cong \operatorname{SO}_6&lt;/math&gt;.)
There are also some coincidences with symmetries of [[regular polyhedra]]: the alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; agrees with the [[icosahedral group]] (itself an exceptional object), and the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover]] of the alternating group A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[binary icosahedral group]].

=== Cyclic groups ===
Cyclic groups of small order especially arise in various ways, for instance:
* &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{C}_2 \cong \{\pm1\} \cong \operatorname{O}(1) \cong \operatorname{Spin}(1) \cong \mathbb Z^\times&lt;/math&gt;, the last being the group of units of the integers.

=== Spheres ===
The spheres ''S''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; admit group structures, which can be described in many ways:
* &lt;math&gt; S^0\cong\operatorname{O}(1)\cong\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; ,
* &lt;math&gt; S^1\cong\operatorname{SO}(2)\cong\operatorname{U}(1)\cong\operatorname{Spin}(2)\cong \mathbb R/\mathbb Z \cong &lt;/math&gt; [[circle group]]
* &lt;math&gt; S^3\cong\operatorname{Spin}(3)\cong\operatorname{SU}(2)\cong\operatorname{Sp}(1)\cong&lt;/math&gt; [[versors|unit quaternions]].

=== Coxeter groups ===
[[File:Dynkin Diagram Isomorphisms.svg|thumb|upright|The exceptional isomorphisms of connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s.]]
There are some exceptional isomorphisms of [[Coxeter diagram]]s, yielding isomorphisms of the corresponding Coxeter groups and of polytopes realizing the symmetries. These are:
* A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2) (2-simplex is regular 3-gon/triangle);
* BC2 = I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4) (2-cube (square) = 2-cross-polytope (diamond) = regular 4-gon)
* A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (3-simplex (tetrahedron) is 3-demihypercube (demicube), as per diagram)
* A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (= D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;?)
* D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
* A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

== Lie theory ==

In low dimensions, there are isomorphisms among the classical Lie algebras and among the classical Lie groups called ''accidental isomorphisms''. For instance, there are isomorphisms between low-dimensional [[spin group]]s and certain classical Lie groups, due to low-dimensional isomorphisms between the [[root systems]] of the different families of [[simple Lie algebra]]s, visible as isomorphisms of the corresponding Dynkin diagrams:
* Trivially, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{sl}_2 = \mathfrak{sp}_1 \cong \mathfrak{so}_3&lt;/math&gt;
* ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}_5 \cong \mathfrak{sp}_2 &lt;/math&gt;
* ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}_{4} \cong \mathfrak{sl}_2 \oplus \mathfrak{sl}_2 &lt;/math&gt;; note that these are disconnected, but part of the ''D''-series
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{sl}_4 \cong \mathfrak{so}_6&lt;/math&gt;
* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; the ''E''-series usually starts at 6, but can be started at 4, yielding isomorphisms
* ''D''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

:Spin(1) = [[Orthogonal group|O(1)]]
:Spin(2) = [[Unitary group|U(1)]] = [[Special orthogonal group|SO(2)]]
:Spin(3) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]] = [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]]
:Spin(4) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]] &amp;times; [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]]
:Spin(5) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(2)]]
:Spin(6) = [[Special unitary group|SU(4)]]

Flooding was invented by [[psychologist]] [[Thomas Stampfl]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leitenberg |first=Harold |title=Handbook of Social and Evaluation Anxiety |publisher=Springer |year=1990 |pages=300–2 |isbn=978-0-306-43438-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6GpO2ZrltgC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=Flooding+phobia&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA302,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used in [[behavior therapy]] today.

Flooding is a psychotherapeutic method for overcoming phobias. This is a faster method of ridding fears when compared with [[systematic desensitization]]. In order to demonstrate the irrationality of the fear, a psychologist would put a person in a situation where they would face their phobia at its worst. Under controlled conditions and using psychologically-proven relaxation techniques, the subject attempts to replace their fear with relaxation. The experience can often be traumatic for a person, but may be necessary if the phobia is causing them significant life disturbances. The advantage to flooding is that it is quick and usually effective. There is, however, a possibility that a fear may spontaneously recur. This can be made less likely with systematic desensitization, another form of a classical condition procedure for the elimination of phobias.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, Stephen M. 2007"&gt;Kosslyn, Stephen M.; Rosenberg, Robin S. (2007) ''Fundamentals of Psychology In Context''. Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
"Flooding" is an effective form of treatment for phobias amongst other psychopathologies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} It works on the principles of [[classical conditioning]] or [[respondent conditioning]]—a form of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s [[classical conditioning]]—where patients change their behaviors to avoid negative stimuli. According to Pavlov, people learn through associations, so if one has a phobia, it is because one associates the feared stimulus with a negative outcome.

Flooding uses a technique based on Pavlov's classical conditioning that uses exposure. There are different forms of exposure, such as imaginal exposure, virtual reality exposure, and in vivo exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Eftekhari, A.; Stines, L.R. &amp; Zoellner, L.A. (2005). Do You Need To Talk About It? Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of Chronic PTSD. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(1), 70–7 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; While systematic desensitization may use these other types of exposure, flooding uses in vivo exposure, actual exposure to the feared stimulus. A patient is confronted with a situation in which the stimulus that provoked the original trauma is present. The psychologist there usually offers very little assistance or reassurance other than to help the patient to use relaxation techniques in order to calm themselves. Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation are common in these kinds of classical conditioning procedures. The theory is that the adrenaline and fear response has a time limit, so a person should eventually have to calm down and realize that their phobia is unwarranted.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, Stephen M. 2007"/&gt; Flooding can be done through the use of virtual reality and is fairly effective.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Price, Page Anderson &amp; Barbara O. Rothbaum (2008). Virtual Reality as Treatment for Fear of Flying: A Review of Recent Research. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 4(4), 309–15 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Tortella-Feliu, Xavier Bornas &amp; Jordi Llabrés (2008). Computer-assisted exposure treatment for flight phobia ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 4(2), 158–71 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Joseph Wolpe]] (1973) carried out an experiment which demonstrated flooding. He took a girl who was scared of cars, and drove her around for hours. Initially the girl was hysterical but she eventually calmed down when she realized that her situation was safe. From then on she associated a sense of ease with cars. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Psychologist [[Aletha Solter]] used flooding successfully with a 5-month-old infant who showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress following surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2007). A case study of traumatic stress disorder in a 5-month-old infant following surgery. ''Infant Mental Health Journal,'' 28(1), 76-96.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Flooding therapy is not for every individual, and the therapist will discuss with the patient the levels of anxiety they are prepared to endure during the session.&lt;ref name="sundel"/&gt; It may also be true that exposure is not for every therapist and therapists seem to shy away from use of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, J.A.; Echiverri, A.; Zoellner, L.A.; Post L. &amp; Feeny, N.C.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' is a [[Hermitian manifold]] which at every point has as an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by [[Élie Cartan]], they form a natural generalization of the notion of [[Riemannian symmetric space]] from [[real manifold]]s to [[complex manifold]]s.

Every Hermitian symmetric space is a homogeneous space for its isometry group and has a unique decomposition as a product of irreducible spaces and a Euclidean space. The irreducible spaces arise in pairs as a non-compact space that, as [[Armand Borel|Borel]] showed, can be embedded as an open subspace of its compact dual space. [[Harish Chandra]] showed that each non-compact space can be realized as a '''bounded symmetric domain''' in a complex vector space. The simplest case involves the groups SU(2), SU(1,1) and their common complexification SL(2,'''C'''). In this case the non-compact space is the [[unit disk]], a homogeneous space for SU(1,1). It is a bounded domain in the complex plane '''C'''. The one-point compactification of '''C''', the [[Riemann sphere]], is the dual space, a homogeneous space for SU(2) and SL(2,'''C''').

Irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the homogeneous spaces of simple compact Lie groups by maximal closed connected subgroups which contain a maximal torus and have center isomorphic to '''T'''.  There is a complete classification of irreducible spaces, with four classical series, studied by Cartan, and two exceptional cases; the classification can be deduced from
[[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]], which classifies closed connected subgroups containing a maximal torus. Hermitian symmetric spaces appear in the theory of [[Jordan triple system]]s, [[several complex variables]], [[complex geometry]], [[automorphic form]]s and [[group representation]]s, in particular permitting the construction of the [[holomorphic discrete series representation]]s of semisimple Lie groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knapp|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==

===Definition===
Let ''H'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of ''H'' of order 2 and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; the fixed point subgroup of σ.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''H'' lying between ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; admits a decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{m},}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of σ and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; the –1 eigenspace.
If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; contains no simple summand of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on ''H'' / ''K'', with ''H'' acting by isometries. A canonical example is given by minus the [[Killing form]]. Under such an inner product, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal. ''H'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' if it has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric. This is equivalent to the existence of a linear map ''J'' with ''J''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −''I'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''.

===Symmetry and center of isotropy subgroup===
If (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;,σ) is Hermitian, ''K'' has non-trivial center and the symmetry σ is inner, implemented by an element of the center of ''K''.

In fact ''J'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and exp ''tJ'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then by the invariance of the inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}&lt;/math&gt;

Define a linear map δ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''T'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking ''X'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple. The symmetry σ is implemented by ''z'' = exp π''T'' and the almost complex structure by exp π/2 ''T''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innerness of σ implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''H'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''H''.&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010" /&gt;

===Irreducible decomposition===
The symmetric space or the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently the identity component of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; or  ''K'') is irreducible on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to the maximality of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; as a subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{l}&lt;/math&gt; and ''K''-invariant subspaces 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{l}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus \mathfrak{m}_1,\,\,\,\ \mathfrak{m}_1=\mathfrak{l}\cap \mathfrak{m}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Any orthogonal symmetric algebra  (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) of Hermitian type can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras of Hermitian type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378–379}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\oplus_{i=1}^N \mathfrak{h}_i,}&lt;/math&gt;

each of which is left invariant by the automorphism σ and the complex structure ''J'', since they are both inner. The eigenspace decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_1&lt;/math&gt; coincides with its intersections with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. So the restriction of σ to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible.

This decomposition of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' when ''H'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is automatically connected. For simply connected ''H'', the symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is the direct product of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simply connected and simple. In the irreducible case, ''K'' is a maximal connected subgroup of ''H''. Since ''K'' acts irreducibly on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; (regarded as a complex space for the complex structure defined by ''J''), the center of ''K'' is a one-dimensional torus '''T''', given by the operators exp ''tT''. Since each ''H'' is simply connected and ''K'' connected, the quotient ''H''/''K'' is simply connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex structure===
{{Main article|Complex structures on homogeneous spaces}}
if ''H'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''H'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From [[Borel-de Siebenthal theory]], the involution σ is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of its center, which is isomorphic to '''T'''. In particular ''K'' is connected. It follows that ''H'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''H'' / ''K'' and the action of ''H'' is holomorphic. Since any Hermitian symmetric space is a product of irreducible spaces, the same is true in general.

At the [[Lie algebra]] level, there is a symmetric decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h = \mathfrak k\oplus\mathfrak m,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak m,J)&lt;/math&gt; is a real vector space with a complex structure ''J'', whose complex dimension is given in the table. Correspondingly, there is a [[graded Lie algebra]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g = \mathfrak{m}_{+}\oplus\mathfrak l\oplus\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m\otimes\mathbb C= \mathfrak m_{-}\oplus\mathfrak m_{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the decomposition into +''i'' and &amp;minus;''i'' eigenspaces of ''J'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak l=\mathfrak k\otimes\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;. The Lie algebra of ''P'' is the semidirect product &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m^{+}\oplus\mathfrak l&lt;/math&gt;. The complex Lie algebras  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are Abelian. Indeed, if ''U'' and ''V'' lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt;, [''U'',''V''] = ''J''[''U'',''V''] = [''JU'',''JV''] = [±''iU'',±''iV''] = –[''U'',''V''], so the Lie bracket must vanish.

The complex subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible for the action of ''K'', since ''J'' commutes with ''K'' so that each is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; with complex structure ±''J''.  Equivalently the centre '''T''' of ''K'' acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; by the identity representation and on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; by its conjugate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The realization of ''H''/''K'' as a generalized flag variety ''G''/''P'' is obtained by taking ''G'' as in the table (the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H'') and ''P'' to be the [[parabolic subgroup]] equal to the semidirect product of ''L'', the complexification of ''K'', with the complex Abelian subgroup exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt;. (In the language of [[algebraic groups]],  ''L'' is the [[Levi factor]] of ''P''.)

===Classification===
Any Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simple, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; connected of maximal rank with center '''T'''. The irreducible ones are therefore exactly the non-semisimple cases classified by [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]].&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010" /&gt;
 
Accordingly, the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' are classified as follows.

In terms of the classification of compact Riemannian symmetric spaces, the Hermitian symmetric spaces are the four infinite series AIII, DIII, CI and BDI with ''p'' = 2 or ''q'' = 2, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII.

===Classical examples===
The irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type are all simply connected. The corresponding symmetry σ of the simply connected simple compact Lie group is inner, given by conjugation by the unique element ''S'' in ''Z''(''K'') / ''Z''(''H'') of period 2. For the classical groups, as in the table above, these symmetries are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=444–447,451–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*AIII: &lt;math&gt;S=\begin{pmatrix}-\alpha I_p &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \alpha I_q\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in S(U(''p'')×U(''q'')), where α&lt;sup&gt;''p''+''q''&lt;/sup&gt;=(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.
*DIII: ''S'' = ''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ SO(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;J_n=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp;I_n \\ -I_n &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
*CI: ''S''=''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ Sp(''n'') = Sp(''n'','''C''') ∩ U(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*BDI: &lt;math&gt;S=\begin{pmatrix}I_p &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -I_2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in SO(''p'')×SO(2).

The maximal parabolic subgroup ''P'' can be described explicitly in these classical cases. For AIII

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{P(p,q)= \begin{pmatrix}A_{pp} &amp; B_{pq}\\ 0 &amp; D_{qq}\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

in SL(''p''+''q'','''C'''). ''P''(''p'',''q'') is the stabilizer of a subspace of dimension ''p'' in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''+''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The other groups arise as fixed points of involutions. Let ''J'' be the ''n'' × ''n'' matrix with 1's on the antidiagonal and 0's elsewhere and set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; J\\ -J &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Then Sp(''n'','''C''') is the fixed point subgroup of the involution θ(''g'') = ''A'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of SL(2''n'','''C'''). SO(''n'','''C''') can be realised as the fixed points of ψ(''g'') = ''B'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in SL(''n'','''C''') where ''B'' = ''J''. These involutions leave invariant ''P''(''n'',''n'') in the cases DIII and CI and ''P''(''p'',2) in the case BDI. The corresponding parabolic subgroups ''P'' are obtained by taking the fixed points. The compact group ''H'' acts transitively on ''G'' / ''P'', so that ''G'' / ''P'' = ''H'' / ''K''.

==Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type==

===Definition===
As with symmetric spaces in general, each compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' has a noncompact dual ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K'' obtained by replacing ''H'' with the closed real Lie subgroup ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of the complex Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h^* = \mathfrak k \oplus i\mathfrak m\subset\mathfrak g.&lt;/math&gt;

===Borel embedding===
Whereas the natural map from ''H''/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is an isomorphism, the natural map from ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is only an inclusion onto an open subset. This inclusion is called the '''Borel embedding''' after [[Armand Borel]]. In fact ''P'' ∩ ''H'' = ''K'' = ''P'' ∩ ''H''*. The images of ''H'' and ''H''* have the same dimension so are open. Since the image of ''H'' is compact, so closed, it follows that ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartan decomposition===
The polar decomposition in the complex linear group ''G'' implies the Cartan decomposition ''H''* = ''K'' ⋅ exp &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; in ''H''*.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in t, ''A'' = exp  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a toral subgroup such that σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on ''A''; and any two such &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''. A similar statement holds for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}^*=i\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Morevoer if ''A''* = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}^*&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H^*=KA^*K.}&lt;/math&gt;

These results are special cases of the Cartan decomposition in any Riemannian symmetric space and its dual. The geodesics emanating from the origin in the homogeneous spaces can be identified with one parameter groups with generators in  &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Similar results hold for in the compact case: ''H''= ''K'' ⋅ exp &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and ''H'' = ''KAK''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of the [[totally geodesic]] subspace ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so its Lie algebra lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and hence equals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the centralizer of ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the conjugates of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular some conjugate of ''X'' lies in any other choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decompositions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H=KAK,\,\,\,H = K\cdot \exp \mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

can be proved directly by applying the [[slice theorem (differential geometry)|slice theorem]] for [[transformation group|compact transformation groups]] to the action of ''K'' on ''H'' / ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=35–36}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the space ''H'' / ''K'' can be identified with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M=\{ \sigma(g)g^{-1}:g\in H\},}&lt;/math&gt;

a closed submanifold of ''H'', and the Cartan decomposition follows by showing that ''M'' is the union of the ''kAk''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k'' in ''K''. Since this union is the continuous image of ''K'' × ''A'', it is compact and connected. So it suffices to show that the union is open in ''M'' and for this it is enough to show each ''a'' in ''A'' has an open neighbourhood in this union. Now by computing derivatives at 0, the union contains an open neighbourhood of 1. If ''a'' is central the union is invariant under multiplication by ''a'', so contains an open neighbourhood of ''a''. If ''a'' is not central, write ''a'' = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''b'' in ''A''. Then τ = Ad ''b'' −  Ad ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is a skew-adjoint operator on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; anticommuting with σ, which can be regarded as a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading operator σ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. By an [[Euler–Poincaré characteristic]] argument it follows that the superdimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the superdimension of the kernel of τ. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{k} - \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{k}_a = \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{m} - \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{m}_a,}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_a&lt;/math&gt; are the subspaces fixed by Ad ''a''. Let the orthogonal complement of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a^\perp&lt;/math&gt;. Computing derivstives it follows that Ad ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; (''a'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''X'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a^\perp&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_a&lt;/math&gt;, is an open neighbourhood of ''a'' in the union. Here the terms ''a'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; lie in the union by the argument for central ''a'': indeed ''a'' is in the center of the identity component of the centralizer of ''a'' which is invariant under σ and contains ''A''.

The dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''rank''' of the Hermitian symmetric space.

===Strongly orthogonal roots===
In the case of Hermitian symmetric spaces, Harish-Chandra gave a canonical choice for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. 
This choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by taking a maximal torus ''T'' of ''H'' in ''K'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the symmetry σ is implemented by an element of ''T'' lying in the centre of ''H'', the root spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; are left invariant by σ. It acts as the identity on those contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and minus the identity on those in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The roots with root spaces in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; 
are called '''compact roots''' and those with root spaces in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''noncompact roots'''. (This terminology originates from the symmetric space of noncompact type.)   If ''H'' is simple, the generator ''Z'' of the centre of ''K'' can be used to define a set of positive roots, according to the sign of α(''Z''). With this choice of roots  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; are the direct sum of the root spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; over positive and negative noncompact roots α. Root vectors ''E''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; can be chosen so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X_\alpha=E_\alpha + E_{-\alpha}, \,\,\, Y_\alpha=i(E_\alpha - E_{-\alpha})}&lt;/math&gt;

lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. The simple roots α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the indecomposable positive roots. These can be numbered so that  α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; vanishes on the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; for ''i'', whereas α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not. Thus α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the unique noncompact simple root and the other simple roots are compact. Any positive noncompact root then has the form β = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ⋅⋅⋅ +  ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with non-negative coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These corfficients lead to a [[lexicographic order]] on positive roots. The coefficient of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is always one because &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible for ''K'' so is spanned by vectors obtained by successively applying the lowering operators ''E''&lt;sub&gt;–α&lt;/sub&gt; for simple compact roots α.

Two roots α and β are said to be '''strongly orthogonal''' if  ±α ±β are not roots or zero, written  α ≐ β. The highest positive root ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is noncompact. Take ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (for the lexicographic order). Then continue in this way taking ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; until the process terminates. The corresponding vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X_i= E_{\psi_i} + E_{-\psi_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and commute by strong orthogonality. Their span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is Harish-Chandra's canonical maximal Abelian subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=375–387}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; (As Sugiura later showed, having fixed ''T'', the set of strongly orthogonal roots is uniquely determined up to applying an element in the Weyl group of ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agaoka|Kaneda|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Maximality can be checked by showing that if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[\sum c_\alpha E_\alpha + \overline{c_\alpha}E_{-\alpha}, E_{\psi_i} + E_{-\psi_i}]=0}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'', then ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all positive noncompact roots α  different from the ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;'s. This follows by showing inductively that if ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, then α is strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a contradiction. Indeed, the above relation shows ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + α cannot be a root; and that if ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – α is a root, then it would necessarily have the form β – ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – α were negative, then α would be a higher positive root than  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, strongly orthogonal to the ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''j'' &lt; ''i'', which is not possible; similarly if  β – ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; were positive.

===Polysphere and polydisk theorem===
Harish-Chandra's canonical choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; leads to a polydisk and polysphere theorem in ''H''*/''K'' and ''H''/''K''. This result reduces the geometry to products of the prototypic example  involving SL(2,'''C'''), SU(1,1) and SU(2), namely the unit disk inside the Riemann sphere.

In the case of ''H'' = SU(2) the symmetry σ is given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries ±''i'' so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sigma\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta\\ -\overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; -\beta\\ \overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

The fixed point subgroup is the maximal torus ''T'', the diagonal matrices with entries ''e''&lt;sup&gt; ±''it''&lt;/sup&gt;. SU(2) acts on the Riemann sphere &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{CP}^1&lt;/math&gt; transitively by Möbius transformations and ''T'' is the stabilizer of 0. SL(2,'''C'''), the complexification of SU(2), also acts by Möbius transformations and the stabiliser of 0 is the subgroup ''B'' of lower triangular matrices. The noncompact subgroup SU(1,1) acts with precisely three orbits: the open unit disk |''z''| &lt; 1; the unit circle ''z'' = 1; and its exterior |''z''| &gt; 1. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{SU}(1,1)/\mathbf{T} = \{z: |z|&lt;1\} \,\,\, \subset \,\,\, B_+/\mathbf{T}_{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C}\,\,\, \subset \,\,\,\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/B = \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\},}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the subgroups of upper triangular and diagonal matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The middle term is the orbit of 0 under the upper unitriangular matrices

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; z\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} =\exp \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; z\\ 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Now for each root ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; there is a homomorphism of π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of SU(2) into ''H'' which is compatible with the symmetries. It extends uniquely to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''') into ''G''. The images of the Lie algebras for different ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s since they are strongly orthogonal. Thus there is a homomorphism π of the direct product SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''H'' compatible with the symmetries. It extends to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''')&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''G''. The kernel of π is contained in the center (±1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; of SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; which is fixed pointwise by the symmetry. So the image of the center under π lies in ''K''. Thus there is an embedding of the polysphere (SU(2)/T)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P'' and the polysphere contains the polydisk (SU(1,1)/T)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. The polysphere and polydisk are the direct product of ''r'' copies of the Riemann sphere and the unit disk. By the Cartan decompositions in SU(2) and SU(1,1), 
the polysphere is the orbit of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' in ''H'' / ''K'' and the polydisk is the orbit of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''*, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = π('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊆ ''K''. On the other hand, ''H'' = ''KAK'' and ''H''* = ''K'' ''A''* ''K''.

Hence every element in the compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polysphere; and every element in the image  under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''* / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polydisk.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
&amp;{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harish-Chandra embedding===
''H''* / ''K'', the  Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, lies in the image of &lt;math&gt;\exp \mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt;, a dense open subset of ''H'' / ''K'' biholomorphic to  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding domain in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt; is bounded. This is the '''Harish-Chandra embedding''' named after [[Harish-Chandra]]. 
 
In fact Harish-Chandra showed the following properties of the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=\exp (\mathfrak{m}_+)\cdot K_{\mathbb{C}} \cdot \exp(\mathfrak{m}_-)=\exp (\mathfrak{m}_+)\cdot P&lt;/math&gt;:

# As a space, '''X''' is the direct product of the three factors.
# '''X''' is open in ''G''.
# '''X''' is dense in ''G''.
# '''X''' contains ''H''*.
# The closure of ''H''* / ''K'' in '''X''' / ''P'' = &lt;math&gt;\exp \mathfrak{m}_+ &lt;/math&gt; is compact.

In fact &lt;math&gt;M_\pm=\exp \mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are complex Abelian groups normalised by ''K''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{m}_+,\mathfrak{m}_-] \subset \mathfrak{k}_{\mathfrak{C}}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{m},\mathfrak{m}] \subset \mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

This implies ''P'' ∩ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = {1}. For if ''x'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''X'' in 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; lies in ''P'', it must normalize ''M''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;. But if ''Y'' lies in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Y=\mathrm{Ad}(X)\cdot Y= Y + [X,Y] + {1\over 2} [X,[X,Y]]\in \mathfrak{m}_+ \oplus \mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}} \oplus \mathfrak{m}_-,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''X'' commutes with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;. But if ''X'' commutes with every noncompact root space, it must be 0, so ''x'' = 1. It follows that the multiplication map μ on ''M''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P'' is injective so (1) follows. Similarly the derivative of μ at (''x'',''p'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu^\prime(X,Y)=\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})X + Y =\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})(X\oplus\mathrm{Ad}(p)Y),}&lt;/math&gt;

which is injective, so (2) follows. For the special case ''H'' = SU(2), ''H''* = SU(1,1) and ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') the remaining assertions are consequences of the identification with the Riemann sphere, '''C''' and unit disk. They can be applied to the groups defined for each root ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. By the polysphere and polydisk theorem ''H''*/''K'', '''X'''/''P'' and ''H''/''K'' are the union of the ''K''-translates of the polydisk, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; and the polysphere. So ''H''* lies in '''X''', the closure of ''H''*/''K'' is compact in '''X'''/''P'', which is in turn dense in ''H''/''K''.

Note that (2) and (3) are also consequences of the fact that the image of ''X'' in ''G''/''P'' is that of the big cell ''B''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''B'' in the [[Complexification (Lie group)#Gauss decomposition|Gauss decomposition]] of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=382–396}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|p=281}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using results on the [[restricted root system]] of the symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' and ''H''*/''K'', 
[[Robert Hermann (mathematician)|Hermann]] showed that the image of ''H''*/''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized unit disk. In fact it is the [[convex set]] of ''X'' for which the [[operator norm]] of ad Im ''X'' is less than one.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=284–286}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bounded symmetric domains===
A bounded domain ''&amp;Omega;'' in a complex vector space is said to be a '''bounded symmetric domain''' if for every ''x'' in ''&amp;Omega;'', there is an involutive biholomorphism ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''&amp;Omega;'' for which ''x'' is an isolated fixed point. The Harish-Chandra embedding exhibits every Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type ''H''* / ''K'' as a bounded symmetric domain. The biholomorphism group of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; / ''K'' is equal to its isometry group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

Conversely every bounded symmetric domain arises in this way. Indeed, given a bounded symmetric domain ''&amp;Omega;'', the [[Bergman kernel]] defines a [[Riemannian metric|metric]] on ''&amp;Omega;'', the [[Bergman metric]], for which every biholomorphism is an isometry. This realizes ''&amp;Omega;'' as a Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical domains===
In the classical cases (I–IV), the noncompact group can be realized by 2 × 2 block matrices&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=321–331}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

acting by generalized [[Möbius transformation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(Z)=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The polydisk theorem takes the following concrete form in the classical cases:&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Siegel|1943|pp=14–15}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Type I'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''pq'''''&lt;/sub&gt; (''p'' ≤ ''q''): for every ''p'' × ''q'' matrix ''M'' there are unitary matrices such that ''UMV'' is diagonal. In fact this follows from the [[polar decomposition]] for ''p'' × ''p'' matrices.
* '''Type III'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: for every complex symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix ''U'' such that ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal. This is proved by a classical argument of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]]. Take ''V'' unitary so that ''V''*''M''*''MV'' is diagonal. Then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;''MV'' is symmetric and its real and imaginary parts commute. Since they are real symmetric matrices they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a real orthogonal matrix ''W''. So ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal if ''U'' = ''WV''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* '''Type II'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: for every complex skew symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix such that ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is made up of diagonal blocks &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; a\\ -a &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and one zero if ''n'' is odd. As in Siegel's artgument, this can be reduced to case where the real and imaginary parts of ''M'' commute. Any real skew-symmetric matrix can be reduced to the given [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Spectral theory|canonical form]] by an orthogonal matrix and this can be done simultaneously for commuting matrices.
* '''Type IV'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: by a transformation in SO(''n'') × SO(2) any vector can be transformed so that all but the first two coordinates are non-zero.

===Boundary components===
The noncompact group ''H''* acts on the complex Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P'' with only finitely many orbits. The orbit structure is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Wolf|1972}}. In particular the closure of the bounded domain ''H''*/''K'' has a unique closed orbit, which is the [[Shilov boundary]] of the domain. In general the orbits are unions of Hermitian symmetric spaces of lower dimension. The complex function theory of the domains, in particular the analogue of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]s, are described for the Cartan domains in {{harvtxt|Hua|1979}}. The closure of the bounded domain is the [[Baily–Borel compactification]] of ''H''*/''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borel|Ji|2006|pp=77–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundary structure can be described using [[Cayley transform]]s. For each copy of SU(2) defined by one of the noncompact roots ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a Cayley transform ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which as a Möbius transformation maps the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Given a subset ''I'' of indices of the strongly orthogonal family ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''partial Cayley transform'' ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the product of the ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s with ''i'' in ''I'' in the product of the groups π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''G''(''I'') be the centralizer of this product in ''G'' and ''H''*(''I'') = ''H''* ∩ ''G''(''I''). Since σ leaves ''H''*(''I'') invariant, there is a corresponding Hermitian symmetric space ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''H''*(''I'')/''H''*(''I'')∩''K'' ⊂ ''H''*/''K'' = ''M'' . The boundary component for the subset ''I'' is the union of the ''K''-translates of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''I'' is the set of all indices, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a single point and the boundary component is the Shilov boundary. Moreover, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is in the closure of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''I'' ⊇ ''J''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric properties==
Every Hermitian symmetric space is a [[Kähler manifold]]. They can be defined equivalently as Riemannian symmetric spaces with a parallel complex structure with respect to which the Riemannian metric is [[Hermitian metric|Hermitian]]. The complex structure is automatically preserved by the isometry group ''H'' of the metric, and so any Hermitian symmetric space ''M'' is a homogeneous complex manifold. Some examples are [[complex vector space]]s and [[complex projective space]]s, with their usual Hermitian metrics and [[Fubini–Study metric]]s, and the complex [[unit ball]]s with suitable metrics so that they become [[Complete metric space|complete]] and Riemannian symmetric. The [[compact space|compact]] Hermitian symmetric spaces are [[projective variety|projective varieties]], and admit a strictly larger [[Lie group]] ''G'' of [[biholomorphism]]s with respect to which they are homogeneous: in fact, they are [[generalized flag manifold]]s, i.e., ''G'' is [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] and the stabilizer of a point is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' of ''G''. Among (complex) generalized flag manifolds ''G''/''P'', they are characterized as those for which the [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]] of the Lie algebra of ''P'' is abelian. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded [[domain (mathematics)|domains]] in complex vector spaces.

==Jordan algebras==
{{See also|Mutation (Jordan algebra)|Symmetric cone|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}
Although the classical Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed by ad hoc methods, [[Jordan triple system]]s, or equivalently Jordan pairs, provide a uniform algebraic means of describing all the basic properties connected with a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type and its non-compact dual. This theory is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} and {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} and summarized in {{harvtxt|Satake|1981}}. The development is in the reverse order from that using the structure theory of compact Lie groups. It starting point is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type realized as a bounded symmetric domain. It can be described in terms of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]]. This Jordan algebra structure can be used to reconstruct the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, including in particular all the associated Lie algebras and Lie groups.

The theory is easiest to describe when the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type. In that case the space is determined by a simple real Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;
with negative definite Killing form. It must admit an action of SU(2) which only acts via the trivial and adjoint representation, both types occurring. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is simple, this action is inner, so implemented by an inclusion of the Lie algebra of SU(2) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The complexification of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as a direct sum of three eigenspaces for the diagonal matrices in SU(2). It is a three-graded complex Lie algebra, with the Weyl group element of SU(2) providing the involution. Each of the ±1 eigenspaces has the structure of a unital complex Jordan algebra explicitly arising as the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra. It can be identified with the multiplicity space of the adjoint representation  of SU(2) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

The description of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type starts from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''. It admits [[Jordan frame (Jordan algebra)|Jordan frames]], i.e. sets of orthogonal minimal idempotents ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. Any two are related by an automorphism of ''E'', so that the integer ''m'' is an invariant called the '''rank''' of ''E''. Moreover, if ''A'' is the complexification of ''E'', it has a unitary [[structure group (Jordan algebra)|structure group]]. It is a subgroup of GL(''A'') preserving the natural complex inner product on ''A''. Any element ''a'' in ''A'' has a polar decomposition {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with  {{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0}}. The spectral norm is defined by ||a|| = sup α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The associated [[bounded symmetric domain]] is just the open unit ball ''D'' in ''A''. There is a biholomorphism between ''D'' and the tube domain ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'' where ''C'' is the open self-dual convex cone of elements in ''E'' of the form {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with ''u'' an automorphism of ''E'' and α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0. This gives two descriptions of the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. There is a natural way of using [[mutation (Jordan algebra)|mutations]] of the Jordan algebra ''A'' to compactify the space ''A''. The compactification ''X'' is a complex manifold and the finite-dimensional Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic vector fields on ''X'' can be determined explicitly. One parameter groups of biholomorphisms can be defined such that the corresponding holomorphic vector fields span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. This includes the group of all complex Möbius transformations corresponding to matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The subgroup SU(1,1) leaves invariant the unit ball and its closure. The subgroup SL(2,'''R''') leaves invariant the tube domain and its closure. The usual Cayley transform and its inverse, mapping the unit disk in '''C''' to the upper half plane, establishes analogous maps between ''D'' and ''T''. The polydisk corresponds to the real and complex Jordan subalgebras generated by a fixed Jordan frame. It admits a transitive action of SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and this action extends to ''X''. The group ''G'' generated by the one-parameter groups of biholomorphisms acts faithfully on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The subgroup generated by the identity component ''K'' of the unitary structure group and the operators in SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. It defines a compact Lie group ''H'' which acts transitively on ''X''. Thus ''H'' / ''K'' is the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. The group ''G'' can be identified with the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H''. The subgroup ''H''* leaving ''D'' invariant is a  noncompact real form of ''G''. It acts transitively on ''D'' so that ''H''* / ''K'' is the dual Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. The inclusions ''D'' ⊂ ''A'' ⊂ ''X'' reproduce the Borel and Harish-Chandra embeddings. The classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type reduces to that of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. These were classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} in terms of [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]s, a special type of [[composition algebra]].

In general a Hermitian symmetric space gives rise to a 3-graded Lie algebra with a period 2 conjugate linear automorphism switching the parts of degree ±1 and preserving the degree 0 part. This gives rise to the structure of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]], to which {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} extended the theory of Jordan algebras. All irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed uniformly within this framework. {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} constructed the irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-tube type from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra together with a period 2 automorphism. The −1 eigenspace of the automorphism has the structure of a Jordan pair, which can be deduced from that of the larger Jordan algebra. In the non-tube type case corresponding to a [[Siegel domain]] of type II, there is no distinguished subgroup of real or complex Möbius transformations. For irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces, tube type is characterized by the real dimension of the Shilov boundary {{math|''S''}} being equal to the complex dimension of {{math|''D''}}.

In [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT), some discipline within [[mathematical logic]], '''induction-induction''' is for simultaneously declaring some inductive type and some inductive predicate over this type.

An [[inductive definition]] is given by rules for generating elements of some type. One can then define some predicate on that type by providing constructors for forming the elements of the predicate , such inductively on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-induction generalizes this situation since one can ''simultaneously'' define the type and the predicate, because '''the rules for generating elements of the type''' &lt;math&gt;A : \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt; '''are allowed to refer to the predicate''' &lt;math&gt;B : A \to \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;.

Induction-induction can be used to define larger types including various universe constructions in type theory.&lt;ref name=Dybjer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A general formulation of simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions in type theory|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=65|issue=2|date=June 2000|pages=525–549|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/Inductive_Recursive.pdf|doi=10.2307/2586554|jstor=2586554|citeseerx=10.1.1.6.4575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limit constructions in category/topos theory&lt;ref name=1337777.OOO&gt;1337777.OOO : ''limit objects depend on morphisms , BUT THIS DEPENDENCE NEED-NOT BE GRAMMATICAL !'' , https://github.com/1337777/cartier/blob/master/cartierSolution3.v&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example 1 ==

Present the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as having the following constructors , note the early reference to the predicate &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; :

* &lt;math&gt;aa : A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ell\ell : \prod_{x : A} B(x) \to A ; &lt;/math&gt;

and-simultaneously present the predicate &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as having the following constructors :

* &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Tru} : B(aa)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Fal} : B(aa)&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x : A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y : B(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Zer} : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x : A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y : B(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Suc}(z) : B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;.

As you can see, we gave rules for generating the elements of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which amount to saying that &lt;math&gt;B(aa)&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the booleans, and &lt;math&gt;B(\ell\ell(x,y))&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the natural numbers.

== Example 2 ==

A simple common example is the Universe à la  Tarski type former.  It creates some inductive type &lt;math&gt;U : \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt; and some inductive predicate &lt;math&gt;T : U \to \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;. For every type in the type theory (except &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; itself!), there will be some element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; which may be seen as some code for this corresponding type ; The predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; inductively encodes each possible type to the corresponding element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; ; and constructing new codes in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; will require referring to the decoding-as-type of earlier codes , via the predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; .

'''Information systems''' ('''IS''') are formal, sociotechnical, organizational systems designed to collect, process, store, and distribute [[information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Piccoli |first1=Gabriele |last2=Pigni |first2=Federico |title=Information systems for managers : with cases |publisher=Prospect Press |isbn=978-1-943153-50-3 |pages=28 |edition=Edition 4.0 |url=https://prospectpressvt.com/titles/piccoli-information-systems-for-managers/ |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Information Systems''' is an academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute [[data (computing)|data]].

(2008). Experiencing MIS. Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, [[computer system]]s, and [[business process]]es. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J A. (2003).

(2003) "18 Reasons Why IT-Reliant Work Systems Should Replace 'The IT Artifact' as the Core Subject Matter of the IS Field," ''Communications of the Association for Information Systems'', 12(23), Oct., pp. 365–394, http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol12/iss1/23/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alter | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = Work System Theory: Overview of Core Concepts, Extensions, and Challenges for the Future | url = | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 72–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a special type of [[work system]]. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.&lt;ref&gt;Alter, S. (2006) The Work System Method: Connecting People, Processes, and IT for Business Results. Works System Press, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, information systems inter-relate with [[data systems]] on the one hand and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of [[communication]] system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-[[formal language]] which supports human decision making and action.

Information systems are the primary focus of study for [[organizational informatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2009). Business Information Systems. Palgrave, Basingstoke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Silver et al. (1995) provided two views on IS that includes software, hardware, data, people, and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marc S. Silver, M. Lynne Markus, [[Cynthia Mathis Beath]]|title=The Information Technology Interactive Model: A Foundation for the MBA Core Course|journal=MIS Quarterly|date=Sep 1995|pages=361–390|url=http://misq.org/the-information-technology-interaction-model-a-foundation-for-the-mba-core-course.html?SID=k2fh85s9nd5a2ne85qh5a3art7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng provided another [http://www.slideshare.net/jgzheng/information-system-a-system-view system view of information system] which also adds processes and essential [[system]] elements like environment, boundary, purpose, and interactions.
The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] defines "Information systems specialists [as] focus[ing] on integrating information technology solutions and business processes to meet the information needs of businesses and other enterprises."&lt;ref name="curricula"&gt;The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005. [http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various types of information systems, for example: [[transaction processing system]]s, [[decision support system]]s, [[knowledge management system]]s, [[learning management system]]s, [[database management system]]s, and office information systems. Critical to most information systems are information technologies, which are typically designed to enable humans to perform tasks for which the human brain is not well suited, such as: handling large amounts of information, performing complex calculations, and controlling many simultaneous processes.

Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available to executives.&lt;ref&gt;Rockart et al. (1996) Eight imperatives for the new IT organization Sloan Management review.&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies have created a position of [[chief information officer]] (CIO) that sits on the executive board with the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO), [[chief financial officer]] (CFO), [[chief operating officer]] (COO), and [[chief technical officer]] (CTO). The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice versa. The [[chief information security officer]] (CISO) focuses on information security management.

The six components that must come together in order to produce an information system are: (Information systems are organizational procedures and do not need a computer or software, this data is erroneous) (IE, an accounting system in the 1400s using ledger and ink utilizes an information system)
# Hardware: The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipment. Among the support, equipment are input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.
# Software: The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them. Computer programs are machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the system to function in ways that produce useful information from data. Programs are generally stored on some input/output medium, often a disk or tape.
# Data: Data are facts that are used by programs to produce useful information. Like programs, data are generally stored in machine-readable form on disk or tape until the computer needs them.
# Procedures: Procedures are the policies that govern the operation of a computer system. "Procedures are to people what software is to hardware" is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedures in a system.
# People: Every system needs people if it is to be useful. Often the most overlooked element of the system are the people, probably the component that most influence the success or failure of information systems. This includes "not only the users, but those who operate and service the computers, those who maintain the data, and those who support the network of computers." &lt;Kroenke, D. M. (2015). MIS Essentials. Pearson Education&gt;';
#Feedback: it is another component of the IS, that defines that an IS may be provided with a feedback (Although this component isn't necessary to function).

Data is the bridge between hardware and people. This means that the data we collect is only data until we involve people. At that point, data is now information.

==Types of information system==
[[File:Four-Level-Pyramid-model.png|thumb|A four level hierarchy |250px]]

The "classic" view of Information systems found in the textbooks&lt;ref&gt;Laudon, K.C. and Laudon, J.P. Management Information Systems, (2nd edition), Macmillan, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s was a pyramid of systems that reflected the hierarchy of the organization, usually [[transaction processing systems]] at the bottom of the pyramid, followed by [[management information systems]], [[decision support systems]], and ending with [[executive information systems]] at the top. Although the pyramid model remains useful since it was first formulated, a number of new technologies have been developed and new categories of information systems have emerged, some of which no longer fit easily into the original pyramid model.

Some examples of such systems are:
* [[data warehouses]]
* [[enterprise resource planning]]
* [[enterprise systems]]
* [[expert systems]]
* [[search engines]]
* [[geographic information system]]
* [[global information system]]
* [[office automation]].

A '''computer(-based) information system''' is essentially an IS using computer technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components of computer-based information systems are:
* ''Hardware''- these are the devices like the monitor, processor, printer and keyboard, all of which work together to accept, process, show data and information.
* ''Software''- are the programs that allow the hardware to process the data.
* ''Databases''- are the gathering of associated files or tables containing related data.
* ''Networks''- are a connecting system that allows diverse computers to distribute resources.
* ''Procedures''- are the commands for combining the components above to process information and produce the preferred output.

The first four components (hardware, software, database, and network) make up what is known as the information technology platform.
Information technology workers could then use these components to create information systems that watch over safety measures, risk and the management of data. These actions are known as information technology services.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer, R. Kelly Jr and Casey G. Cegielski. Introduction to Information System: Support and Transforming Business Fourth Edition. New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain information systems support parts of organizations, others support entire organizations, and still others, support groups of organizations. Recall that each department or functional area within an organization has its own collection of application programs or information systems. These functional area information systems (FAIS) are supporting pillars for more general IS namely, [[business intelligence]] systems and [[dashboard]]s {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. As the name suggest, each FAIS support a particular function within the organization, e.g.: accounting IS, finance IS, production-operation management (POM) IS, marketing IS, and human resources IS. In finance and accounting, managers use IT systems to forecast revenues and business activity, to determine the best sources and uses of funds, and to perform audits to ensure that the organization is fundamentally sound and that all financial reports and documents are accurate. Other types of organizational information systems are FAIS, [[Transaction processing system]]s, [[enterprise resource planning]], [[office automation]] system, [[management information system]], [[decision support system]], [[expert system]], executive dashboard, [[supply chain management system]], and [[electronic commerce]] system. Dashboards are a special form of IS that support all managers of the organization. They provide rapid access to timely information and direct access to structured information in the form of reports. Expert systems attempt to duplicate the work of human experts by applying reasoning capabilities, knowledge, and expertise within a specific domain.

==Information system development==
Information technology departments in larger organizations tend to strongly influence the development, use, and application of information technology in the organizations.
A series of methodologies and processes can be used to develop and use an information system. Many developers use a systems engineering approach such as the [[system development life cycle]] (SDLC), to systematically develop an information system in stages.  The stages of the system development lifecycle are planning, system analysis and requirements, system design, development, integration and testing, implementation and operations and maintenance. 
Recent research aims at enabling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=Gustaf|last2=Sobernig|first2=Stefan|last3=Aram|first3=Michael|title=Evolutionary Business Information Systems|journal=Business and Information Systems Engineering|date=February 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=33–36|doi=10.1007/s12599-013-0305-1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12599-013-0305-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aram|first1=Michael|last2=Neumann|first2=Gustaf|title=Multilayered analysis of co-development of business information systems|journal=Journal of Internet Services and Applications|date=2015-07-01|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13174-015-0030-8|url=http://www.jisajournal.com/content/pdf/s13174-015-0030-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ongoing, collective development of such systems within an organization by the entirety of human actors themselves.
An information system can be developed in house (within the organization) or outsourced. This can be accomplished by outsourcing certain components or the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Using MIS|year=2009|publisher=Kroenke|isbn=0-13-713029-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific case is the geographical distribution of the development team ([[offshoring]], [[global information system]]).

A computer-based information system, following a definition of [[Börje Langefors|Langefors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= [[Börje Langefors]]|first=|title=Theoretical Analysis of Information Systems|year=1973|publisher=Auerbach|isbn=0-87769-151-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technologically implemented medium for:
* recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions,
* as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.
&lt;!-- hiding this incomprehensible 5-part compound noun: This can be formulated as a generalized information systems design mathematical program. --&gt;

[[Geographic information systems in geospatial intelligence|Geographic information systems]], land information systems, and disaster information systems are examples of emerging information systems, but they can be broadly considered as spatial information systems.
System development is done in stages which include:
* Problem recognition and specification
* Information gathering
* Requirements specification for the new system
* System design
* System construction
* System implementation
* Review and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Computer Studies|year=2008|publisher=Frederick Nyawaya|isbn=9966-781-24-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an academic discipline==
{{see also|Information science|Information technology|Information management}}

The field of study called ''information systems'' encompasses a variety of topics including systems analysis and design, computer networking, information security, database management and decision support systems. ''[[Information management]]'' deals with the practical and theoretical problems of collecting and analyzing information in a business function area including business productivity tools, applications programming and implementation, electronic commerce, digital media production, data mining, and decision support. ''Communications and networking'' deals with the telecommunication technologies.

Several IS scholars have debated the nature and foundations of Information Systems which have its roots in other reference disciplines such as [[Computer Science]], [[Engineering]], [[Mathematics]], [[Management Science]], [[Cybernetics]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Culnan, M. J. Mapping the Intellectual Structure of MIS, 1980-1985: A Co-Citation Analysis, ''MIS Quarterly'', 1987, pp. 341-353.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keen, P. G. W.

Information Systems: An Emerging Discipline?, McGraw- Hill, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Information systems also can be defined as a collection of hardware, software, data, people and procedures that work together to produce quality information.

===Differentiating IS from related disciplines===
[[File:IS-Relationships-Chart.jpg|thumb|Information Systems relationship to [[Information Technology]], [[Computer Science]], [[Information Science]], and [[Business]].]]

Similar to computer science, other disciplines can be seen as both related and foundation disciplines of IS. The domain of study of IS involves the study of theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena, which determine the development, use, and effects of information systems in organization and society.&lt;ref&gt;John, W., and Joe, P. (2002) "Strategic Planning for Information System." 3rd Ed. West Sussex. John wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; But, while there may be considerable overlap of the disciplines at the boundaries, the disciplines are still differentiated by the focus, purpose, and orientation of their activities.&lt;ref name="dogpile.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksbw.com/books/computers/leslie-j/2006/files/informationsystems2006.pdf#page=30|title=Scoping the Discipline of Information Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broad scope, the term ''Information Systems'' is a scientific field of study that addresses the range of strategic, managerial, and operational activities involved in the gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and use of information and its associated technologies in society and organizations.&lt;ref name="dogpile.com"/&gt; The term information systems is also used to describe an organizational function that applies IS knowledge in industry, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="dogpile.com"/&gt; ''Information Systems'' often refers to the interaction between algorithmic processes and technology. This interaction can occur within or across organizational boundaries. An information system is the technology an organization uses and also the way in which the organizations interact with the technology and the way in which the technology works with the organization’s business processes. Information systems are distinct from [[information technology]] (IT) in that an information system has an information technology component that interacts with the processes' components.

One problem with that approach is that it prevents the IS field from being interested in non-organizational use of ICT, such as in social networking, computer gaming, mobile personal usage, etc. A different way of differentiating the IS field from its neighbours is to ask, "Which aspects of reality are most meaningful in the IS field and other fields?"&lt;ref name="ref-basden-2010"&gt;[http://aisel.aisnet.org/ukais2009/10 Basden, A. (2010)  On Using Spheres of Meaning to Define and Dignify the IS Discipline.  ''International Journal of Information Management'', 30, 13-20.]  It employs the philosophy of the late [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] to differentiate distinct aspects or 'spheres of meaning'. The paper suggests that while computer science finds the [http://www.dooy.info/formative.html formative] aspect, of shaping, structuring, processing, of central interest, and business and organizational fields find the [http://www.dooy.info//economic.html economic] and [http://www.dooy.info/social.html social] aspects of central interest, the Information Systems field can find the [http://www.dooy.info/lingual.html lingual aspect] of central interest, while making links with the aspects of the neighbouring disciplines.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach, based on philosophy, helps to define not just the focus, purpose and orientation, but also the dignity, destiny and, responsibility of the field among other fields.

==Career pathways==

Information Systems workers enter a number of different careers:
* [[Information System Strategy]]
* [[Management Information System]]s
* [[Project Management]]
* [[Enterprise Architecture]]
* [[Software development|IS Development]]
* IS Organization
* [[Information technology consulting|IS Consulting]] 
* IS Security
* IS Auditor

There is a wide variety of career paths in the information systems discipline. "Workers with specialized technical knowledge and strong communications skills will have the best prospects. Workers with management skills and an understanding of business practices and principles will have excellent opportunities, as companies are increasingly looking to technology to drive their revenue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center; Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|year=2008|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/infosys/infosys.htm|title=Information Systems|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information technology is important to the operation of contemporary businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The information systems field includes the people in organizations who design and build information systems, the people who use those systems, and the people responsible for managing those systems.
The demand for traditional IT staff such as programmers, business analysts, systems analysts, and designer is significant. Many well-paid jobs exist in areas of Information technology. At the top of the list is the chief information officer (CIO).

The CIO is the executive who is in charge of the IS function. In most organizations, the CIO works with the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief financial officer (CFO), and other senior executives. Therefore, he or she actively participates in the organization's strategic planning process.

==Research==
Information systems research is generally interdisciplinary concerned with the study of the effects of information systems on the behaviour of individuals, groups, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Galliers, R.D., [[M.

They identified research outputs as follows:

# ''Constructs'' which are concepts that form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to describe problems within the domain and to specify their solutions.
# A ''model'' which is a set of propositions or statements expressing relationships among constructs.
# A ''method'' which is a set of steps (an algorithm or guideline) used to perform a task. Methods are based on a set of underlying constructs and a representation (model) of the solution space.
# An ''instantiation'' is the realization of an artifact in its environment.

Also research activities including:
# ''Build'' an artifact to perform a specific task.
# ''Evaluate'' the artifact to determine if any progress has been achieved.
# Given an artifact whose performance has been evaluated, it is important to determine why and how the artifact worked or did not work within its environment. Therefore, ''theorize'' and ''justify'' theories about IT artifacts.

Although Information Systems as a discipline has been evolving for over 30 years now,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Avgerou | first1 = C | year = 2000 | title = Information systems: what sort of science is it? | url = | journal = Omega | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 567–579 | doi=10.1016/s0305-0483(99)00072-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the core focus or identity of IS research is still subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benbasat | first1 = I. | last2 = Zmud | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = The identity crisis within the IS discipline: defining and communicating the discipline's core properties | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 183–194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agarwal | first1 = R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = The information systems identity crisis: focusing on high- visibility and high-impact research | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 381–398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El Sawy | first1 = O | year = 2003 | title = The IS core –IX: The 3 faces of IS identity: connection, immersion, and fusion | url = | journal = Communications of the AIS | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 588–598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main views around this debate: a narrow view focusing on the IT artifact as the core subject matter of IS research, and a broad view that focuses on the interplay between social and technical aspects of IT that is embedded into a dynamic evolving context.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, O., Ghazawneh, A.

Since the study of information systems is an applied field, industry practitioners expect information systems research to generate findings that are immediately applicable in practice. This is not always the case however, as information systems researchers often explore behavioral issues in much more depth than practitioners would expect them to do. This may render information systems research results difficult to understand, and has led to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kock | first1 = N. | authorlink = Ned Kock | authorlink4 = Heinz Klein | last2 = Gray | first2 = P. | last3 = Hoving | first3 = R. | last4 = Klein | first4 = H. | last5 = Myers | first5 = M. | last6 = Rockart | first6 = J. | year = 2002 | title = Information Systems Research Relevance Revisited: Subtle Accomplishment, Unfulfilled Promise, or Serial Hypocrisy? | url = http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol8/iss1/23/ | journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 8 | issue = 23| pages = 330–346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last ten years, the business trend is represented by the considerable increasing of Information Systems Function (ISF) role, especially with regard the enterprise strategies and operations supporting. It became a key-factor to increase productivity and to support new value creation.&lt;ref&gt;Casalino, N., Mazzone, G. (2008): Externalization of a banking information systems function.

The international body of Information Systems researchers, the [[Association for Information Systems]] (AIS), and its Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals (23 April 2007), proposed a 'basket' of journals that the AIS deems as 'excellent', and nominated: ''[[Management Information Systems Quarterly]]'' (MISQ), ''[[Information Systems Research]]'' (ISR), ''[[Journal of the Association for Information Systems]]'' (JAIS), ''[[Journal of Management Information Systems]]'' (JMIS), ''[[European Journal of Information Systems]]'' (EJIS), and ''[[Information Systems Journal]]'' (ISJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senior Scholars|year=2007|title=AIS Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals: A basket of six (or eight) A* journals in Information Systems |url=http://home.aisnet.org/associations/7499/files/Senior%20Scholars%20Letter.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003184529/http://home.aisnet.org/associations/7499/files/Senior%20Scholars%20Letter.pdf|archivedate=October 3, 2007|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tioman Rainforest.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Jungle on [[Tioman Island]], [[Malaysia]]]]
A '''jungle''' is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees. Application of the term has varied greatly over recent centuries and it has little scientific meaning.  Before the 1970s, various [[tropical forests]] were referred to as jungles but this terminology has fallen out of usage. Jungles in [[Western culture|Western]] literature can represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation, attributed to the jungle's association in [[colonial discourse]] with places colonised by Europeans.

==Etymology==
The word ''jungle'' originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Jangla'' ({{Lang-sa| जङ्गल}}), meaning uncultivated land. Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled thicket"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The jungle and the aroma of meats: an ecological theme in Hindu medicine. Volume 4 |author=Francis Zimmermann| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1999| isbn= 81-208-1618-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that a cognate word in [[Urdu]] did refer to forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dialectical History of 'Jungle' in Pakistan: An Examination of the Relationship between Nature and Culture| author=Dove, Michael R. |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |volume=48| issue= 3 |year=1992 |pages=231–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is prevalent in many languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Iranian Plateau]], where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing [[primeval forest]] or to the unkempt [[tropical vegetation]] that takes over abandoned areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Sir Henry Yule|Yule, Henry, Sir]]|title= Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles can not be straightforwardly defined.

==Varying usage==

===As dense and impenetrable vegetation===
[[File:Dry rainforest.jpg|thumb|left|Vine thicket, a typical impenetrable jungle, Australia]]
One of the most common meanings of ''jungle'' is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the [[tropics]]. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biomes/biomes_tropical_forests_page_1.html Tropical Forests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010223155/http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biomes/biomes_tropical_forests_page_1.html |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/forest/introf.htm Mysterious Journey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702005610/http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/forest/introf.htm |date=2012-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nygren, A. 2006 Representations of Tropical Forests and Tropical Forest-Dwellers in Travel Accounts of ‘National Geographic', Environmental Values 15&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition draws a distinction between [[rainforest]] and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/baumanpr/geosat2/Central%20Africa%20I/Central%20Africa%20Part%20I.htm|title=Tropical Wet Realms Of Central Africa, Part I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/rainforest.htm|title=Rainforest Biomes|website=www.blueplanetbiomes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, rainforests in areas where rainforest has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kricher JC. 1997.

Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

[[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Monsoon forests]] and [[mangrove]]s are commonly referred to as jungles of this type. Having a more open canopy than rainforests, monsoon forests typically have dense understoreys with numerous [[liana]]s and shrubs making movement difficult,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jrjurjev/Geo101_files/Forest_Biome[1][1].ppt{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}

===As moist forest===
[[File:Fluss Dja Somalomo.JPG|thumb|Impenetrable jungle lining a river bank in rainforest, Cameroon]]

Because European explorers initially travelled through tropical rainforests largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that the entire forest was impenetrable jungle.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, T. (1983). ''The Amazon: The World's Wild Places''. Time-Life Books. New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/baumanpr/geosat2/Central%20Africa%20I/Central%20Africa%20Part%20I.htm | title=Tropical Wet Realms of Central Africa, Part 1 | publisher=Oneonta.edu (State University of New York College at Oneonta) |year=2009 | accessdate=November 29, 2012 | author=Baumann, Paul R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This in turn appears to have given rise to the second popular usage of jungle as virtually any humid [[tropical forest]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Purser, B. 2003.

T.  1930 Jungle in Relation to Malaria in Bengal. Indian Journal of Medical Research 18:1&lt;/ref&gt; with no reference to the vegetation structure or the ease of travel.

The generic term "[[tropical forest]]" and "rainforest" have largely replaced "jungle" as the descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has occurred since the 1970s. "Rainforest" itself did not appear in English dictionaries prior to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rogers, C. 2012 ''Jungle Fever: Exploring Madness and Medicine in Twentieth-Century Tropical Narratives''. Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville. {{ISBN|9780826518316}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "jungle" accounted for over 80% of the terms used to refer to tropical forests in print media prior to the 1970s; since then it has been steadily replaced by "rainforest",&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Slater, C (2003). In Search of the Rain Forest. Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although "jungle" still remains in common use when referring to tropical rainforests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== As metaphor ===
[[File:Jungle comics 128.jpg|thumb|upright|Use of the jungle to represent savageness and ferocity in popular culture.]]

As a metaphor, ''jungle'' often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be "survival of the fittest". This reflects the view of "city people" that forests are such places. [[Upton Sinclair]] gave the title ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark Eden: the swamp in nineteenth-century American culture |series=Volume 43 of Cambridge studies in American literature and culture Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences|author=Miller, David Cameron |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1989| isbn=0-521-37553-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[The Law of the Jungle]]" is also used in a similar context, drawn from [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894)—though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos.

The word "jungle" itself carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fearing, F. (1963) "The problem of metaphor" Southern Journal of Communication&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. (1962)  "The Thin Red Line". Dell Publishing New York&lt;/ref&gt;  The change from "jungle" to "rainforest" as the preferred term for describing tropical forests as has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of "jungle".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, C (2004). Marketing the ‘rain forest’: Raw Vanilla fragrance and the ongoing transformation of the jungle. Cultural Geographies 11:4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavson, E. 2007 "Rhetoric: How Politicians Manipulate Language and the Media to Shape Public Thought" Hinckley Journal of Politics 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural studies|Cultural scholars]], especially [[post-colonial]] critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For example: [[Edward Said]] notes that the [[Tarzan]] depicted by [[Johnny Weissmuller]] was a resident of the jungle representing the savage, untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it;&lt;ref name = Said&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Jungle Calling| title = Reflections on Exile: And Other Essays| series = Convergences Series| first = Edward W. | last = Said| publisher =  Harvard University Press| year = 2000| isbn = 9780674003026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his essay "[[An Image of Africa]]" about ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' Nigerian novelist and theorist [[Chinua Achebe]] notes how the jungle and [[Africa]] become the source of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz.&lt;ref name =Achebe&gt;{{cite journal| first = Achebe| last = Chinua| title = An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' | journal = Massachusetts Review| edition = 18| year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] compared Israel to "a villa in the jungle" - a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli political debates. Barak's critics on the left side of Israeli politics strongly criticised the comparison. For example, [[Uri Avnery]] charged that comparing "civilised" Israel with "a villa" and Israel's Arab neighbors with the "wild beasts" of the "jungle" tends to throw the blame for the absence of peace on the "wild" Arab and Palestinian side, and absolve Israel of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Uri Avnery, "Barak: A Villa in the Jungle", Gush Shalom website, July 7, 2007 [http://zope.gush-shalom.org/home/en/channels/avnery/archives_barak/],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akiva Eldar, "The price of a villa in the jungle", [[Ha'aretz]], Jan. 30, 2006 [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-price-of-a-villa-in-the-jungle-1.178800 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Derfner, "Ehud Barak to step down: On his de-evolution, and Israel's", +972 Magazine, November 26, 2012 [http://972mag.com/ehud-baraks-de-evolution-and-israels/60889/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''K G Kannabiran''' was a [[human rights]] activist and a lawyer of the [[Andhra Pradesh High Court]] in the Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] (AP). He was cofounder and National President of [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] (PUCL).

== Early life ==

He was born on 9 November 1929, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, to Kandala Gopalaswamy Iyengar, a doctor, and Pankajammal. His early education was in Hyderabad and Nellore. He obtained a BA Hons degree in economics (equivalent to Masters) and a degree in law from Madras University.  He enrolled in the Madras Bar Council and started his practice in 1953 with the help of his advocate cousin Srinivasa Raghavan (Rajappa). He married Vasanth Kannabiran in 1959. His daughter, Chitra Kannabiran, a molecular biologist was born in 1960; second daughter [[Kalpana Kannabiran]], a sociologist was born in 1961; and his son Arvind Kannabiran, a cinematographer, was born in 1966.  He moved to Hyderabad and set up practice there soon after his marriage.

== Career ==

=== Lawyer ===

He practiced law in Madras (now [[Chennai]]) with moderate success and shifted to Hyderabad in 1960 soon after his marriage in 1959.

=== Human rights activist ===

Kannabiran started his career as an advocate in AP High court in the early 1960s. He defended human rights and political dissents cases, including [[Shankar Guha Niyogi]], conspiracy cases and political prisoner cases. He was a founding member of PUCL and APCLC and other human rights organizations. Kannabiran took up cases of human rights violations, political dissidents and encounter cases, including four major conspiracy cases, [[Parvathipuram, Andhra Pradesh|Parvathipuram]] ([[Srikakulam district]]), Tarimela Nagi Reddy, [[Secunderabad]] and [[Ramnagar, Hyderabad|Ramnagar]] in 1975. Pleading his case in the lower court, he ultimately succeeded in getting the murderers convicted and punished by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defending dissent and democracy|url= http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/defending-dissent-and-democracy/article1090248.ec|accessdate=15 January 2011 |newspaper= [[The Hindu]]|date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of PUCL and APCLC ==
The [[PUCL]] was an attempt to establish an organisation free from political ideologies, through which people connected with different political parties could be brought onto a common platform for the defence of civil liberties and human rights. Kannabiran was one of the National Executive members of the PUCL. Kannabiran remained President of PUCL from 1995 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUCL Formed|url=http://www.pucl.org/from-archives/may81/puclformed.htm|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Laysan millerbird''' (''Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris'') was a subspecies of the [[millerbird]], similar in appearance to the remaining subspecies, the [[Nihoa millerbird]]. Its [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side was brown, and its belly was grayish. Its name derives from its favorite food, several species of moths of the genus ''[[Agrotis]]'' (such as the endemic and likewise extinct ''[[Laysan Noctuid Moth|Agrotis laysanensis]]'') commonly referred to as "millers" (Butler &amp; Usinger, 1963).

==Extinction==
[[File:Acrocepahlus familiaris, Rothsch..jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]]]] 
[[File:Laysan Millerbird and Black Mamo.jpg|thumb|left|Laysan millerbird and [[black mamo]] specimens in 1901]] 
Very tame, it was abundant on [[Laysan]], where it was [[Endemism|endemic]], in the 1890s (Udvardy, 1996). After the fateful introduction of [[domestic rabbit]]s in 1903, which nearly denuded the island of vegetation in the next few years, the birds probably declined rapidly. Supposedly, there were 1500 still alive in April 1915 as reported by the [[USCGC Thetis|USCGC ''Thetis'']] expedition (Clapp ''et al.'', 1996), but a thorough 1911 census by the [[State University of Iowa]] expedition had found only "a few" (Dill &amp; Bryan, 1912), as did a brief visit in February 1916. As land bird populations on Laysan fluctuate heavily and because there was considerable poaching for the Japanese [[Hatmaking|millinery]] trade in the 1910s, the supposed 1915 figure cannot be discounted, but it seems highly improbable. At any rate, the 1923 [[Tanager Expedition|expedition]] by the {{USS|Tanager|AM-5}} reported only one unconfirmed sighting which seems to have been erroneous (Olson, 1996). Thus, it can be concluded that the bird disappeared at some time in the late 1910s.

As the vegetation disappeared, the bird suffered increased egg predation by [[Laysan finch]]es (''Telespiza cantans''), [[ruddy turnstone]]s (''Arenaria interpres'') and [[bristle-thighed curlew]]s (''Numenius tahitiensis''), as well as increased competition for food and nesting habitat; a small patch of tree tobacco (''[[Nicotiana glauca]]'') was the only locality left where the millerbird, the [[Laysan rail]] (''Porzana palmeri'') and the [[Laysan honeycreeper]] (''Himatione fraithii'') could nest with a reasonable chance of success. Additionally, the moths which formed its main food source became likewise extinct or exceedingly rare as their food plants were eaten by the rabbits, and thus the only significant food left were brine flies, which, though abundant, would also be utilized by the other land birds and the [[Laysan duck]] (''Anas laysanensis''), all of which were more aggressive than the millerbird. It is most likely that the Laysan millerbird was the first of the three avian taxa to have gone extinct on Laysan, the last individuals of the {{okina}}apapane disappearing in a sandstorm around April 24, 1923 and the rail also disappearing around that time.

The '''''Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game''''' is a [[role-playing game]] originally written by [[John Wick (role-playing game designer)|John Wick]] and published by [[Alderac Entertainment Group]], under license from [[Five Rings Publishing Group]], in 1997. The game uses the [[Legend of the Five Rings]] setting, and primarily the nation of [[Rokugan]], which is based on [[feudal]] [[Japan]] with influences from other East Asian cultures.

Like most role-playing games, Legend of the Five Rings is played by one or more players and a [[game master]], who controls the events that happen during the game as well as the [[non-player characters]] (NPCs). ''Legend of the Five Rings'' features many [[courtiers]] and other [[non-combatant]] character types as valid player characters.

In 1998, Legend of the Five Rings won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Roleplaying Game of 1997''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1997/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (1997) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331064621/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1997/list-of-winners |archivedate=2008-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the L5R RPG 3rd Edition sourcebook Emerald Empire won the Scrye Players Choice Award.

In September 2015, AEG and [[Fantasy Flight Games]] jointly announced that the intellectual property had been sold to FFG.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/9/11/a-new-emperor-rises/&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth edition of the role-playing game released in October, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/9/26/legend-of-the-five-rings-rpg-beta/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
{{main|Rokugan}}

The [[Setting (fiction)|fictional setting]] of ''Legend of the Five Rings'' is similar to [[feudal]] [[Japan]], though it also includes aspects of other [[Asia]]n cultures, as well as [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] and [[mythology|myth]]ical beasts.  There is no given name for the entire world which the setting describes, so "Rokugan" is used alternately to refer to the specific nation within the setting or to refer to the entire world.

Rokugani society is based on a [[clan]] structure, with seven (and later eight) so-called "Great Clans", as well as a number of minor clans.  Great Clans are made up of several family lines, each with their own general purpose within the clan.  Minor clans generally only have one family.  Each clan also has areas of land bequeathed by the emperor under their control.  The emperor retains ownership of all lands, however, and the clans essentially rent the lands by paying annual taxes.

==System==
The [[role-playing game system|game system]] of ''Legend of the Five Rings'' uses [[10-sided dice]] exclusively. Usually, when a die is rolled and the result is 10 (normally marked '0' on the die), the die is said to "explode".  In this situation, the player rolls again and the new result is added to the original result. If this second result is a 10, the player rolls a third time, totaling all three results.  This process is repeated until the player rolls something other than 10. The second edition and most books made for it were written to work both with this system and with [[D20 rules]] as presented in the [[Oriental Adventures|Oriental Adventures D&amp;D setting]]; this was discontinued after 3rd edition was published.

===Roll &amp; Keep===
The mechanic for which the game is most widely known is the "Roll &amp; Keep" system, designed by Dave Williams and [[John Wick (role-playing game designer)|John Wick]].  When dice are rolled, there are two quantities given: a number of dice to be rolled and a number of dice to be "kept".  The totals of the kept dice are added together, giving the player the total sum for his or her roll.  For example, if a roll called for five dice to be rolled and three kept (said simply "five keep three" or written "5k3"), five dice would be rolled.  Out of those five, the player would choose three (generally, but not necessarily, the player would choose the three with the highest values) whose values would be added together for the total value of the roll.

===Rings===
''Legend of the Five Rings'' uses eight [[Statistic (role-playing games)|traits]]: [[Endurance|Stamina]], [[Volition (psychology)|Willpower]], [[physical strength|Strength]], [[Perception]], [[Agility]], [[Intelligence (trait)|Intelligence]], [[Reflexes]], and [[Awareness]].  The Traits are grouped into pairs associated with four elemental "Rings" (respectively to above): [[Earth]], [[Water]], [[Fire]] and [[Air]].  The four Rings represent a limitation in character development, because in order for a character to advance, the level of his Rings must increase, and to increase a character’s Rings, both of the Ring’s associated Traits must increase.

There is a fifth Ring, called [[The Book of Five Rings#The Book of Void|Void]].  This ring, like the other four, is taken from [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', although "Nothingness" is a better translation of the text.  In the game, Void represents a character’s inner strength, and its use allows a character to perform extraordinary actions, or to perform normal actions more efficiently.

===Character creation===
There are primarily two methods of creating characters in role-playing games: to roll dice to randomly generate attributes or to begin with a set number of points and a formula by which attributes can be purchased with these points.  ''Legend of the Five Rings'' uses the latter method.  Each new character begins with 40 "Character Points" to spend to create the character (except for [[ronin]] characters, which begin with 55). These points are spent to raise the level of the character’s [[#Rings|Traits and Void Ring]], to raise the level of the character’s skills, and to purchase new skills. In previous versions of the game, characters started with 30 points, or 45 for ronin.

These points may also be used to purchase ''Advantages'', which give the character some extra bonus or ability that is designed to help in certain situations (such as "Large", which increases the damage a character can inflict, or "Social Position", which increases that character’s standing in the courts of the land).  Conversely, if a player so chooses, he can select a number of Disadvantages for his character, which give extra Character Points to spend in other areas, but imposes some penalty on the character during play (such as "Small", which decreases the damage the character can inflict with certain weapons, or "Bad Reputation", which causes a great number of NPCs to dislike the character).

===Lethality===
The Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game is renowned for its lethality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alderac.com/l5r/files/2012/03/L5R-Free-RPG-Day.pdf|title=Legacy of Disaster pg.5 sidebar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020739/http://www.alderac.com/l5r/files/2012/03/L5R-Free-RPG-Day.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players who charge into combat unaware will often find their characters killed in the first session. Proper role-playing is encouraged to avoid combat when unnecessary, but the characters do have requisite abilities to survive if combat is forced in the early stages.

==''Oriental Adventures''==
''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' was published originally in 1985 by [[TSR, Inc.]] as an expansion for ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and was set in a land called [[Kara-Tur]]. In 2001, [[Wizards of the Coast]] released a new edition of ''Oriental Adventures'' as an expansion for the third edition of [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]. It was decided to make this new version of ''Oriental Adventures'' a showcase for their recently acquired ''Legend of the Five Rings''. An official (but not 100% comprehensive) update of Oriental Adventures to the v.3.5 rules can be found in Dragon Magazine #318 (April 2004), pp. 32-48. 

For the entirety of its Second Edition, with the exception of the ''Player's Guide'', ''Game Master's Guide'', ''Way of the Shadowlands'', ''Winter Court: Kyuden Asako'', and ''Time of the Void'', books published for the Legend of the Five Rings RPG had two different sets of game mechanics: the mechanics from the ''Legend of the Five Rings Second Edition Player's Guide'' and corresponding mechanics for [[d20 System]], such as those presented in ''Oriental Adventures''. Beginning with the Third Edition of the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, and because of the lack of availability of the now out of print ''Oriental Adventures'', the d20 System rules have been dropped from current Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game books.

In [[mathematics]], in particular in [[category theory]], the '''lifting property''' is a property of a pair of morphisms in a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. It is used in [[homotopy theory]] within [[algebraic topology]] to define properties of morphisms starting from an explicitly given class of morphisms. It appears in a prominent way in the theory of [[model categories]], an axiomatic framework for [[homotopy theory]] introduced by [[Daniel Quillen]]. It is also used in the definition of a [[factorization system]], and of a [[weak factorization system]], notions related to but less restrictive then the notion of a model category. Several elementary notions may also be expressed using the lifting property starting from a list of (counter)examples.

==Formal definition==
A morphism ''i'' in a category has the ''left lifting property'' with respect to a morphism ''p'', and ''p'' also has the ''right lifting property'' with respect to ''i'', sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;i\perp p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;i\downarrow p&lt;/math&gt;, iff the following implication holds for each morphism ''f'' and ''g'' in the category:
* if the outer square of the following diagram commutes, then there exists ''h'' completing the diagram, i.e. for each &lt;math&gt;f:A\to X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p\circ f = g \circ i&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;h:B\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h\circ i = f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\circ h = g&lt;/math&gt;.

::[[File:Model category lifting.png]]

This is sometimes also known as the morphism ''i'' being ''orthogonal to'' the morphism ''p''; however, this can also refer to
the stronger property that whenever ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, the diagonal morphism ''h'' exists and is also required to be unique.

For a class ''C'' of morphisms in a category, its ''left orthogonal'' &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp \ell}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C^\perp&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the lifting property, respectively its ''right orthogonal'' &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp r}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{}^\perp C&lt;/math&gt;, is the class of all morphisms which have the left, respectively right, lifting property with respect to each morphism in the class C. In notation,

: &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}:=\{ i \mid \forall p\in C, i\perp p\} \text{ and } C^{\perp r} := \{ p \mid \forall i\in C, i\perp p\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the orthogonal of a class ''C'' is a simple way to define a class of morphisms excluding non-isomorphisms from ''C'', in a way which is useful in a [[diagram chasing]] computation.

Thus, in the category Sets of sets the right orthogonal &lt;math&gt;\{ \emptyset \longrightarrow \{*\} \}^{\perp r}&lt;/math&gt; of the simplest non-surjection &lt;math&gt;\emptyset\longrightarrow \{*\}&lt;/math&gt;, is the class of surjections. The left and right orthogonals of &lt;math&gt;\{x_1,x_2\}\longrightarrow \{*\}&lt;/math&gt;, the simplest non-injection, are both precisely the class of injections, &lt;math&gt;\{\{x_1,x_2\}\longrightarrow \{*\}\}^{\perp\ell} = \{\{x_1,x_2\}\longrightarrow \{*\}\}^{\perp r} = \{ f \mid f \text{ is an injection } \}&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell r} \supset C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp r\ell} \supset C&lt;/math&gt;. The class &lt;math&gt; C^{\perp\ell}&lt;/math&gt; is always closed under retracts, pullbacks, (small) products (whenever they exist in the category) and composition of morphisms, and contains all isomorphisms of C. Meanwhile, &lt;math&gt; C^{\perp r}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under retracts, pushouts, (small) coproducts and 
transfinite composition (filtered colimits) of morphisms (whenever they exist in the category), and also contains all isomorphisms.

==Examples==
A number of notions can be defined by passing to the left or right orthogonal several times starting from a list of explicit examples, i.e. as &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}, C^{\perp r}, C^{\perp\ell r}, C^{\perp\ell\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a class consisting of several explicitly given morphisms. A useful intuition is to think that the property of left-lifting against a class ''C'' is a kind of negation
of the property of being in ''C'', and that right-lifting is also a kind of negation. Hence the classes obtained from ''C'' by taking orthogonals an odd number of times, such as &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}, C^{\perp r}, C^{\perp\ell r\ell}, C^{\perp\ell\ell\ell}&lt;/math&gt; etc., represent various kinds of negation of ''C'', so &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp\ell}, C^{\perp r}, C^{\perp\ell r\ell}, C^{\perp\ell\ell\ell}&lt;/math&gt; each consists of morphisms which are far from having property &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples of lifting properties in algebraic topology===
A map &lt;math&gt;f:U\to B&lt;/math&gt; has the ''path lifting property'' iff &lt;math&gt;\{0\}\longrightarrow [0,1] \perp f&lt;/math&gt; where 
&lt;math&gt;\{0\}\longrightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of one end point of the closed interval into the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

A map &lt;math&gt;f:U\longrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; has the [[homotopy lifting property]] iff &lt;math&gt; X \longrightarrow X\times [0,1] \perp f&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X\longrightarrow X\times [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is the map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples of lifting properties coming from model categories===
Fibrations and cofibrations.
* Let ''Top'' be the category of [[topological space]]s, and let &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of maps &lt;math&gt;S^n\longrightarrow D^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, embeddings of the boundary &lt;math&gt;S^n=\partial D^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; of a ball into the ball &lt;math&gt;D^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;WC_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of maps embedding the upper semi-sphere into the disk. &lt;math&gt;WC_0^{\perp\ell}, WC_0^{\perp\ell r}, C_0^{\perp\ell}, C_0^{\perp\ell r}&lt;/math&gt; are the classes of fibrations, acyclic cofibrations, acyclic fibrations, and cofibrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hovey | first = Mark |title = Model Categories }} Def. 2.4.3, Th.2.4.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let ''sSets'' be the category of [[simplicial set]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of boundary inclusions &lt;math&gt;\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;WC_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of horn inclusions &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]&lt;/math&gt;. Then the classes of fibrations, acyclic cofibrations, acyclic fibrations, and cofibrations are, resp., &lt;math&gt;WC_0^{\perp\ell}, WC_0^{\perp\ell r}, C_0^{\perp\ell}, C_0^{\perp\ell r}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hovey | first = Mark |title = Model Categories }} Def. 3.2.1, Th.3.6.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ch}(R)&lt;/math&gt; be the category of [[chain complex]]es over a commutative ring ''R''. Let &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; be the class of maps of form

:: &lt;math&gt;\cdots\to 0\to R \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots \longrightarrow \cdots \to R \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id}} R \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots, &lt;/math&gt;

: and &lt;math&gt;WC_0&lt;/math&gt; be

:: &lt;math&gt; \cdots \to 0\to 0 \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots \longrightarrow \cdots \to R \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id}} R \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

:Then &lt;math&gt;WC_0^{\perp\ell}, WC_0^{\perp\ell r}, C_0^{\perp\ell}, C_0^{\perp\ell r}&lt;/math&gt; are the classes of fibrations, acyclic cofibrations, acyclic fibrations, and cofibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hovey | first = Mark |title = Model Categories }} Def. 2.3.3, Th.2.3.11&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''line coordinates''' are used to specify the position of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] just as point coordinates (or simply [[Coordinate system|coordinates]]) are used to specify the position of a point.

==Lines in the plane==
There are several possible ways to specify the position of a line in the plane. A simple way is by the pair {{nowrap|(''m'', ''b'')}} where the equation of the line is ''y''&amp;nbsp;= ''mx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''. Here ''m'' is the [[slope]] and ''b'' is the [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]]. This system specifies coordinates for all lines that are not vertical. However, it is more common and simpler algebraically to use coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'')}} where the equation of the line is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. This system specifies coordinates for all lines except those that pass through the origin. The geometrical interpretations of ''l'' and ''m'' are the negative reciprocals of the ''x'' and [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]] respectively.

The exclusion of lines passing through the origin can be resolved by using a system of three coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} to specify the line in which the equation, ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Here ''l'' and ''m'' may not both be 0. In this equation, only the ratios between ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' are significant, in other words if the coordinates are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then line represented remains the same. So {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} is a system of [[homogeneous coordinates]] for the line.

If points in the [[real projective plane]] are represented by homogeneous coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, the equation of the line is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''nz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, provided {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'') ≠ (0,0,0) .}} In particular, line coordinate {{nowrap|(0, 0, 1)}} represents the line ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, which is the [[line at infinity]] in the [[projective plane]]. Line coordinates {{nowrap|(0, 1, 0)}} and {{nowrap|(1, 0, 0)}} represent the ''x'' and ''y''-axes respectively.

==Tangential equations==
Just as ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 can represent a [[curve]] as a subset of the points in the plane, the equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a subset of the lines on the plane. The set of lines on the plane may, in an abstract sense, be thought of as the set of points in a projective plane, the [[Duality (projective geometry)|dual]] of the original plane. The equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 then represents a curve in the dual plane. 

For a curve ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 in the plane, the [[tangent]]s to the curve form a curve in the dual space called the [[dual curve]]. If φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the equation of the dual curve, then it is called the '''tangential equation''', for the original curve. A given equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a curve in the original plane determined as the [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the lines that satisfy this equation. Similarly, if φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') is a [[homogeneous function]] then φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a curve in the dual space given in homogeneous coordinates, and may be called the homogeneous tangential equation of the enveloped curve.

Tangential equations are useful in the study of curves defined as envelopes, just as Cartesian equations are useful in the study of curves defined as loci.

==Tangential equation of a point==
A linear equation in line coordinates has the form ''al''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bm''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants. Suppose (''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is a line that satisfies this equation. If ''c'' is not 0 then ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''/''c'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''/''c'', so every line satisfying the original equation passes though the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). Conversely, any line through (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') satisfies the original equation, so ''al''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bm''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the equation of set of lines through (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). For a given point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), the equation of the set of lines though it is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so this may be defined as the tangential equation of the point. Similarly, for a point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') given in homogeneous coordinates, the equation of the point in homogeneous tangential coordinates is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''nz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Formulas==
The intersection of the lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the solution to the linear equations 

:&lt;math&gt;l_1x+m_1y+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;l_2x+m_2y+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Cramer's rule]], the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{m_1-m_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1},\,y=-\frac{l_1-l_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  l_1 &amp; m_1 &amp; 1 \\
  l_2 &amp; m_2 &amp; 1 \\
  l_3 &amp; m_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

For homogeneous coordinates, the intersection of the lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;(m_1n_2-m_2n_1,\,l_2n_1-l_1n_2,\,l_1m_2-l_2m_1).&lt;/math&gt;

The lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  l_1 &amp; m_1 &amp; n_1 \\
  l_2 &amp; m_2 &amp; n_2 \\
  l_3 &amp; m_3 &amp; n_3
\end{vmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Dually, the coordinates of the line containing (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are
:&lt;math&gt;(y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

==Lines in three-dimensional space==
{{main|Plücker coordinates}}
For two given points in the [[real projective plane]], (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the three determinants

:&lt;math&gt;y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1&lt;/math&gt;

determine the [[projective line]] containing them.

Similarly, for two points in '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,  (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the line containing them is determined by the six determinants 

:&lt;math&gt;x_1y_2-x_2y_1,\,x_1z_2-x_1z_2,\,y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_1w_2-x_2w_1,\,y_1w_2-y_2w_1,\,z_1w_2-z_2w_1.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the basis for a system of homogeneous line coordinates in three-dimensional space called ''Plücker coordinates''. Six numbers in a set of coordinates only represent a line when they satisfy an additional equation. This system maps the space of lines in three-dimensional space to [[projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, but with the additional requirement the space of lines corresponds to the [[Klein quadric]], which is a [[manifold]] of dimension four.

More generally, the lines in ''n''-dimensional projective space are determined by a system of ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 homogeneous coordinates that satisfy a set of (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3)/2 conditions, resulting in a manifold of dimension&amp;nbsp;2(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

==With complex numbers==
[[Isaak Yaglom]] has shown&lt;ref name=Yaglom68&gt;[[Isaak Yaglom]] (1968) ''Complex Numbers in Geometry'', [[Academic Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; how [[dual number]]s provide coordinates for oriented lines in the Euclidean plane, and [[split-complex number]]s form line coordinates for the [[hyperbolic plane]]. The coordinates depend on the presence of an origin and reference line on it. Then, given an arbitrary line its coordinates are found from the intersection with the reference line. The distance ''s'' from the origin to the intersection and the angle &amp;theta; of inclination between the two lines are used:
:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tan \frac {\theta}{2}) (1 + s \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the dual number&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|81}} for a Euclidean line, and

:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tan \frac {\theta}{2}) (\cosh s + j \sinh s)&lt;/math&gt; is the split-complex number&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|118}} for a line in the Lobachevski plane.

Since there are lines ultraparallel to the reference line in the Lobachevski plane, they need coordinates too: There is a unique [[ultraparallel theorem|common perpendicular]], say ''s'' is the distance from the origin to this perpendicular, and ''d'' is the length of the segment between reference and the given line.
:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tanh \frac {d}{2}) (\sinh s + j \cosh s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ultraparallel line.&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|118}}

The motions of the line geometry are described with [[linear fractional transformation]]s on the appropriate complex planes.&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|87,123}}

[[Magical thinking]] in various forms is a [[cultural universal]] and an important aspect of [[religion]].
Magic is prevalent in all societies, regardless of whether they have organized religion or more general systems of [[animism]] or [[shamanism]].
Religion and magic became conceptually separated with the development of western [[monotheism]], where the distinction arose between supernatural events sanctioned by mainstream religious doctrine ([[miracle]]s) and magic rooted in folk belief or occult speculation.
In pre-monotheistic religious traditions, there is no fundamental distinction between religious practice and magic; tutelary deities concerned with magic are sometimes called hermetic deities or spirit guides.

== Magical practices in prehistory ==

=== Anthropological and psychological perspectives ===
{{Main|Magical thinking|Evolutionary origin of religion}}

It is a postulate of modern [[anthropology]], at least since early 1930s, that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.122-3. Quotation: {{quotation|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1932) [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True ''Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119025854/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;TOC=True |date=2011-11-19 }}, in [[Gifford Lectures]]. Lecture II [https://archive.is/20120731050138/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPFHCR&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;ArticleID=3  ''Hope'']. Quotation: {{quotation|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of The Golden Bough, would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional differences between religion and magic==
Early sociological interpretations of magic by [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Henri Hubert]] emphasized the social conditions in which the phenomenon of magic develops.&lt;ref name='Pasi'&gt;Pasi, M. 2006. "Magic". in von Stuckrad, K. (ed.) ''The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Religion. Volume III. M-R.'' Leiden and Boston, Brill. 1134-1140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private).&lt;ref name='Pasi' /&gt;

[[Ralph Merrifield]], the [[British people|British]] archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a [[Material culture|material]] approach to magic,&lt;ref name='Materiality'&gt;Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. 'Introduction: The materiality of the materiality of magic', in Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. (eds.) ''The Materiality of Magic: An artefactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs''.Oxford and Philadelphia, Oxbow Books. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; defined the differences between religion and magic: 
"'Religion' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; 'magic', the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; 'ritual', prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse".&lt;ref name='Merrifield'&gt;Merrifield, R. 1987. ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London, Guild Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, “instrumental coercive manipulation”, opposed to the religious attitude of “personal and supplicative negotiation”; Action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.&lt;ref name='Versnel'&gt;Versnel, H. S. 1991. “Some Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion.” Numen 38 (2). 177-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

This separation of the terms 'religion' and 'magic' in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing "belief in spiritual beings" will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, B-C. 2013. "Towards Historicizing 'Magic' in Antiquity", ''Numen'' 60. 308-347.&lt;/ref&gt; However using the word 'magic' alongside 'religion' is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place.&lt;ref name='Versnel' /&gt;

==Religious practices and magic==
Both magic and religion contain [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref name='Merrifield' /&gt; 
Most cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a [[shamanistic]] interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ Magic and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235043/http://whitemagicwitch.com/magic-and-religion/ |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names of the gods ===
There is a long-standing belief in the power of [[true name]]s, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being's true name grants  power over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all.  This belief is reflected in traditional [[Wicca]], where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God - the two supreme deities in Wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the [[Tetragrammaton]] (YHWH, usually translated as "&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;" in small caps) to refer to God in the [[Tanakh]]. The same belief is seen in [[Hinduism]], but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a ''good'' thing.  Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="CHU"&gt;{{cite book

{{main|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible|Christian views on magic}}
Magic and [[Abrahamic religions]] have had a somewhat checkered past.  The [[King James Version]] of the Bible included the famous translation "''Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live''" (Exodus 22:18),&lt;ref name="KJV"&gt;{{cite book
 | title = [[King James Version of the Bible]]
 | year = 1611 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul]] is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh's  sorcerers as well as [[The Staff of Moses|the staff of Moses]] and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh's magicians and the non-magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh's magicians, they employed "their secret arts" whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2019%20-%20JANES%201996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The words 'witch' and 'witchcraft' appear in some English versions of the Bible. One verse that is probably responsible for more deaths of suspected witches than any other passage from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) is Exodus 22:18.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the King James Version, this reads: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." The precise meaning of the Hebrew word ''kashaph'', here translated as 'witch' and in some other modern versions, 'sorceress', is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]] it was translated as ''pharmakeia'', meaning 'pharmacy', and on this basis, [[Reginald Scot]] claimed in the 16th century that 'witch' was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Scot|Scot, Reginald]] (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''message sequence chart''' (or '''MSC''') is an [[interaction diagram]] from the [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]] family standardized by the [[International Telecommunication Union]].

The purpose of recommending MSC (Message Sequence Chart) is to provide a trace language for the specification and description of the communication behaviour of system components and their environment by means of message interchange. Since in MSCs the communication behaviour is presented in a very intuitive and transparent manner, particularly in the graphical representation, the MSC language is easy to
learn, use and interpret. In connection with other languages it can be used to support methodologies for system specification, design, simulation, testing, and documentation.

==History==
The first version of the MSC standard was released in March 12, 1993.

The 1996 version added references, ordering and [[Inline expansion|inlining]] expressions concepts, and introduced HMSC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.sdl-forum.org/MSC2000present/sld005.htm
| title=HMSC
| publisher=sdl-forum.org
| accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''H'''igh-level '''M'''essage '''S'''equence '''C'''harts), which are the way of expressing a sequence of MSCs.

The MSC 2000 version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; added object orientation, refined the use of data and time in diagrams, and added the concept of remote method calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Latest version has been published in February 2011.

==Symbols in MSC==
The existing symbols are:
* MSC head, lifeline, and end: a vertical line with a box at the top, and a box or a cross at the bottom.
* Instance creation: horizontal dashed arrow to the newly created instance.[[File:Dynamic Process Creation in a Message Sequence Chart.png|thumb|Dynamic process creation in an MSC]]
* Message exchange: horizontal arrow.
* Control flow: horizontal arrow with the 'call' prefix, dashed arrow for reply symbol, method and suspension symbols in between. [[File:MSC CallOperation.png|thumb|Call operation in an MSC]]
* Timers: start, cancel, time out.
* Time interval: relative and absolute with a dashed vertical arrow. [[File:MSC TimeConstraint.png|thumb|Time constraint in an MSC]]
* Conditions: usually used to represent a state of the underlying state machine.
* Action: a box.
* In-line expressions: alternative composition, sequential composition, exception, optional region, parallel composition, iteration (loop).
* Reference: reference to another MSC. [[File:MSC Reference.png|thumb|MSC Reference in an MSC]]
* Data concept: The user can use any data concept, if binding is undefined the default data concept is the one from [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]] as defined in Z.121 recommendation.
* Coregion: a double dashed instance line to describe unordered events.

==Symbol extensions==
* [[SDL-RT]] has introduced:
** a semaphore instance representation. [[File:SDL-RT MSC Semaphore.png|thumb|SDL-RT Semaphore extension to MSC]]
** a save symbol to save messages.

==Comparison to UML==
UML 2.0 Sequence Diagram is strongly inspired by the ITU-T MSC. Still, for historical reasons, the default basic principles are quite different:
* Lifelines
:* In an MSC, the vertical lines are autonomous execution entities. They usually represent state machines executing in parallel. The state machines need not be on the same computer.
:* In a Sequence Diagram, a vertical line is usually an object. The object can be active (in its own thread of execution) or passive (in the execution context of an active object).
* Arrows
:* In an MSC an arrow is usually an asynchronous message sent from one entity to another one. Once the message is sent the sending entity resumes its execution.
:* In a Sequence Diagram an arrow is usually understood as an operation call on a class. It is therefore synchronous and the calling entity hangs until the operation returns.
 
It has been said that MSC has been considered as a candidate for the [[Unified Modeling Language#Interaction diagrams|interaction diagrams]] in UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, proponents of MSC such as [[Ericsson]] think that MSC is better than [[Unified Modeling Language|UML 2.0]] for modelling large or complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Live Sequence Charts==
[[David Harel]] suggested that MSC had shortcomings such as:
* MSC propose a weak [[Partially ordered set|partial ordering]] semantics that makes it impossible to capture some behavioral requirements,
* The relationship between the MSC requirements and the executable specification is not clear,
and proposed Live Sequence Charts (LSC) as an extension on the MSC standard .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Mūla Bandha''' is a Sanskrit (मूल बंध) compound term:  ''Mūla'' denotes "[[:wikt:root|root]]", "[[:wikt:base|base]]",&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.515&lt;/ref&gt; "[[:wikt:beginning|beginning]]", "[[:wikt:foundation|foundation]]",&lt;ref name="Iyengar, 1976: p.459"&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.459&lt;/ref&gt; "origin or cause", "[[:wikt:basis|basis]]", "[[:wikt:source|source]]";&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.437&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bandha'' denotes "[[:wikt:bondage|bondage]]", "[[:wikt:fetter|fetter]]",&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.525&lt;/ref&gt; "posture",&lt;ref name="Iyengar, 1976: p.459"/&gt; "joining together", "catching hold of".&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.436&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. K. S. Iyengar|Iyengar]] (1976: p.&amp;nbsp;525) defines Mūla Bandha as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A posture where the body from the [[anus]] to the [[navel]] is contracted and lifted up and towards the spine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is qualified in that the actual muscle contracted is not the [[sphincter]] muscle nor the muscle which cessates urination, but [[Transverse perineal muscles|the muscle equidistant between the two]]. 

Maehle (2007: p.&amp;nbsp;11) defines it as "root lock" and further specifies that:

{{quote|The root referred to here is the root of the spine, the [[pelvic floor]] or, more precisely, the centre of the pelvic floor, the [[perineum]].  The perineum is the muscular body between the anus and the genitals. By slightly  contracting the [[pubococcygeus muscle|pubo-coccygeal (PC) muscle]], which goes from the pubic bone to the tail bone (coccyx), we create an energetic seal that locks ''prana'' into the body and so prevents it from leaking out at the base of the spine.  ''Mula Bandha'' is said to move ''prana'' into the central channel, called ''sushumna'', which is the subtle equivalent of the spine.|&lt;ref&gt;Maehle, Gregor (2007). ''Ashtanga Yoga: Practice and Philosophy'' (Paperback).  New World Library. {{ISBN|1-57731-606-1}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-1-57731-606-0}}, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mūla Bandha is the principal, key and primary Bandha of the [[Yoga|Yogic traditions]]. Mūla Bandha is essential to all safe, grounded workings of [[bodymind]] disciplines. This Bandha in and of itself conditions the [[Muladhara]] [[Chakra]], simultaneously keening, rooting and engaging the systemic [[:wikt:plethora|plethora]] of processes that constitute [[bodymind]] and with diligence resolving them in discipline and accord. Mūla Bandha should be held as a restraint only after [[kumbhaka]], which in this instance is where the breath is expressed in its entirety and held outside the body.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1976: p.435&lt;/ref&gt; Iyengar (1976: p.&amp;nbsp;435) likens the functionality of the [[Bandha (Yoga)|Bandha]] and especially Mūla Bandha to "safety-valves which should be kept shut during the practice of kumbhakas".

Iyengar (1976:  p.&amp;nbsp;437) specifies the energetic prāṇas of [[vayu|Vāyu]] engaged through Mūla Bandha as: "...[[Apāna Vāyu]] (the prāṇa in the lower abdomen), whose course is downwards, is made to flow up to unite with [[Prāna Vāyu]], which has its seat within the region of the chest."

Iyengar (1976:  p.&amp;nbsp;437) cautions that:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
Mūla Bandha should be attempted first in antara kumbhaka (retention after inhalation). The region of the lower abdomen between the navel and the anus is contracted towards the spine and pulled up to the diaphragm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Iyengar (1976:  p.&amp;nbsp;437) states that:  "While practicing Mūla Bandha, the yogi attempts to reach the true source or mūla of creation."

The '''murder of Sylvia Likens''' took place in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], United States in October 1965. The 16-year-old was held captive, [[Child abuse|abused]] and [[Torture murder|tortured to death]] over a period of three months by Gertrude Baniszewski, Baniszewski's children, and other neighborhood children. Likens' parents, who were [[Traveling carnival|carnival]] workers, had initially left her and her sister Jenny in the care of the Baniszewski family, paying Gertrude $20 a week to care for the sisters.

Baniszewski, her daughter Paula, her son John, and two neighborhood youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were tried and convicted of torturing and [[Child murder|murdering]] Likens. The case was described by the prosecutor in Baniszewski's trial as "the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of Indiana".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835635,00.html Avenging Sylvia]; ''Time Magazine'', 27 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backgrounds==

===Gertrude Baniszewski===
'''Gertrude Nadine Baniszewski''' ({{nee|'''Van Fossan'''}}; September 19, 1929 – June 16, 1990) was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to Mollie Myrtle (''née'' Oakley) and Hugh Marcus Van Fossan Sr., both of whom were originally from [[Illinois]] and were of [[Americans|American]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent. Baniszewski was the third of six children. On October 5, 1939, Baniszewski witnessed her 50-year-old father's death from a sudden heart attack. Six years later, she dropped out of school to marry 18-year-old John Stephan Baniszewski (1926–2007), who was originally from [[Youngsville, Pennsylvania]], with whom she had six children. Although John Baniszewski had a volatile temper, the two stayed together for ten more years before divorcing.

Baniszewski, then 34, moved in with 22-year-old Dennis Lee Wright, who abused her. She had one child with Dennis, Dennis Lee Wright Jr. (later given the name Denny Lee Wright by his adoptive mother), but after his birth, Wright abandoned Gertrude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/2.html|title=truTV - Funny Because it&amp;#039;s tru|website=truTV|access-date=2016-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016070750/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/2.html|archive-date=2013-10-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sylvia Likens===
'''Sylvia Marie Likens''' (January 3, 1949 – October 26, 1965) was the third child of [[Carny|carnival workers]] Lester Cecil Likens (1926–2013) and his wife Elizabeth Frances "Betty" (née Grimes, 1927–1998). She was born between two sets of fraternal [[twin]]s: Diana and Danny (two years older), and Jenny and Benny (one year younger, the former disabled by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]).&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901828,00.html Addenda to De Sade]; ''Time Magazine'', 6 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Likens' parents' marriage was unstable. The family moved frequently, and the parents had financial difficulties. Likens and her sister Jenny were often boarded out or forced to live with relatives, such as their grandmother, so that their schoolwork would not suffer while their parents were on the road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/3.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Foster Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825083251/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/3.html |date=2008-08-25 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; To earn money, Likens babysat and ironed, the same kind of work that was done by Gertrude Baniszewski. At the time of Likens' death, her favorite rock band was [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLG4NQn0yfQC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=Memorial+Baptist+Church+sylvia+likens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7s7j_Pkzw&amp;sig=2KWFo_DLm67dUl2gi640-scvsbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_x47YxJzWAhWFy7wKHaCNCDQQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Memorial%20Baptist%20Church%20sylvia%20likens&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1965, Sylvia and Jenny Likens were living with their mother, Betty, in Indianapolis. During that time, Betty was arrested and jailed for [[shoplifting]]. Lester Likens, who had recently separated from his wife, arranged for his daughters to board with Gertrude Baniszewski, the mother of the girls' new friend Paula Baniszewski (aged 17) and Paula's six siblings, Stephanie (15), John (12), Marie (11), Shirley (10), James (8), and few-months-old Dennis Lee Wright Jr. During her early time with the Baniszewski family, she would sing with Baniszewski's daughter, Stephanie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/4.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Foster Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601215939/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/4.html |date=2009-06-01 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Baniszewskis were poor, Lester "didn't pry" into the condition of the house (as he reported at the trial), and he encouraged Baniszewski to "straighten his daughters out."&lt;ref name=IndyStar&gt;[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/sylvia.html The murder of Sylvia Likens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010807200635/http://www.indystar.com/library/factfiles/crime/history/likens_sylvia/sylvia.html |date=2001-08-07 }}; ''Indianapolis Star'', Library Factfiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse and death==
Lester Likens agreed to pay Baniszewski $20 a week in exchange for her care of the Likens girls. Baniszewski, described by ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' as a "haggard, underweight [[asthma]]tic",&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; was suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and the stress of several failed marriages. When the weekly payment arrived late, Baniszewski beat the Likens girls on their bare buttocks with paddles.

Baniszewski soon focused her [[child abuse|abuse]] exclusively on Sylvia. She accused her of stealing candy that she had bought, and humiliated her when she admitted that she once had a boyfriend. Baniszewski's daughter, Paula, who was pregnant at the time, kicked Likens in the genitals and accused her of being pregnant. Later medical examination proved that Likens was not pregnant and could not have been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/5.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: A Dubious Start] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912111536/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/5.html |date=2008-09-12 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; Baniszewski began allowing her older children to beat Likens and repeatedly push her down stairs for entertainment. During a church function, Baniszewski [[Force-feeding|force-fed]] Likens a [[hot dog]] overloaded with condiments. Likens vomited afterwards, which she was later forced to consume. Baniszewski also accused Likens of [[prostitution]] and delivered [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] sermons about the filthiness of prostitutes and women in general.

Likens was later accused of spreading rumors within [[Arsenal Technical High School]] that Paula and Stephanie Baniszewski were prostitutes. This supposedly provoked Stephanie's boyfriend, Coy Hubbard, to physically attack Likens. Hubbard and his classmates soon made frequent visits to the Baniszewski residence to torment Likens, often collaborating with Bansizewski's own children and Baniszewski herself. With Baniszewski's encouragement, they routinely beat her&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;, forced her to eat feces and drink urine, used her as a practice dummy in violent [[judo]] sessions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/looking-back-indianas-infamous-crime-50-years-later/|title=Looking Back On Indiana's Most Infamous Crime, 50 Years Later|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, lacerated her, burnt her body with lit cigarettes over 100 times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/teen-girl-fatally-bullied-indiana-house-horrors-article-1.1309751|title=Teen girl fatally bullied in Indiana house of horrors|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and severely injured her genitals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+mauling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGSvm_dYp&amp;sig=3-BNwkDBPlm0lQBoSFJ6blvfd_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijhc61muPXAhVGErwKHY6mCAUQ6AEIcTAP#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20mauling&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Paula Baniszewski once beat Likens in the face with such force that she broke her own wrist. She later had to wear a cast, which she used to further beat Likens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177&amp;sid=0be6b27a888f78f72360647d85b4b093|title=Jenny Fay Likens - Sister of Deceased - Sylvia Likens|website=sylvialikens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=eONxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+beaten+with+cast&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7-werp-P_L&amp;sig=PMyFIdvOAIDl2BNcGJXM7j-bkc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVtd-khprWAhXFwrwKHVZQCQMQ6AEIWDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20beaten%20with%20cast&amp;f=false|title=World Encyclopedia of 20th Century Murder|last=R.

Gertrude Baniszewski later forced Jenny to hit her sister, beating her if she did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/7.html "The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917053831/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/7.html |date=2008-09-17 }} Crime Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Raymond and Phyllis Vermillion, a middle-aged couple who moved next door, saw Gertrude to be an ideal caretaker for their two children. They visited the Baniszewski residence on two occasions, where they witnessed Paula, with Gertrude's approval, abusing Likens and boasting about it in front of them. The Vermillions refused to report the abuse to the authorities out of fear on both occasions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=173|title=Phyllis Vermillion - Next Door Neighbor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baniszewski eventually forbade Likens from attending school after Likens confessed to having stolen a gym suit from the school when Baniszewski would not buy a gym suit for her. She brutally beat and whipped Sylvia and did the same for Jenny after remembering that she supposedly stole a tennis shoe. Baniszewski then switched the topic to the "evils" of premarital sex and brutally kicked Sylvia repeatedly in the genitals. She also burned all of her fingers with matches and further whipped her.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+gym+suit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGVvnS7Um&amp;sig=WTIum4elXzljW-EsdKm3G49sWvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPqKqsx7rYAhUKe7wKHRdDBq4Q6AEIZDAP#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20gym%20suit&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Likens eventually became [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] due to the severity of the torture.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLG4NQn0yfQC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+incontinent+house+of+evil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b7t7l5RjEw&amp;sig=0tzn0Z2Pfp3iwl56pA-2U5PUlpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS_MnXvsfYAhVMmJQKHefRBcYQ6AEIZDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20incontinent%20house%20of%20evil&amp;f=false|title=House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was denied access to the bathroom and so was forced to wet herself. As punishment for her incontinence, Baniszewski threw her in the basement and locked her in. Throughout her captivity, Baniszewski frequently, with the assistance of her children and their friends, restrained Likens in a bathtub filled with scalding water and rubbed salt onto her burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177|title=Jenny Fay Likens - Sister of Deceased|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was often kept naked and rarely fed. At times, Baniszewski and her twelve-year-old son John Jr. would make Likens eat her own feces, as well as urine and feces from the diaper of Gertrude Baniszewski's one-year-old son. She also made abusing Likens a pastime, charging the neighborhood children five cents to see the "display" of Likens' naked body and tie, beat, burn and mutilate her. Likens attempted to alert the neighbors for help by screaming and hitting the walls of the basement with a spade, ultimately to no avail.

The Likens sisters had no way to contact other family members to inform them of the abuse. Jenny, especially, struggled to do this since she was constantly threatened by Baniszewski that she would be abused and tortured next like her sister. She was also [[Bullying|bullied]] by the neighborhood girls and beaten whenever she alluded to Sylvia's situation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Nonetheless, they encountered Diana, their older and married sister, at the local park. Since Diana was forbidden by her parents to make contact with the sisters due to her estrangement, she initially assumed that the punishments Sylvia and Jenny were receiving were related to this. Neither party was aware that they lived less than a mile and a half apart. Diana eventually learned that Sylvia and Jenny were staying at a strangers' home and she attempted to visit them. Upon her visit, Bansizewski told Diana, unaware of who Baniszewski was, that the Likens sisters were not allowed to see her and ordered her off her property. At one point, Diana secretly gave a starving Sylvia a sandwich. Sylvia remained silent about the matter but after Marie Baniszewski revealed it, Paula and Gertrude choked and paddled Sylvia before subjecting her to another scalding bath.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, a neighbor made an anonymous report, which prompted an in-home visit by a public health nurse. The nurse entered the home and made inquiries, but had no choice but to leave without further investigation. She told Baniszewski the report was about Likens; Baniszewski replied she had kicked Likens out of her house, and that her whereabouts were unknown. The nurse had no way of knowing that the subject of her inquiry was right below her in the basement. 

Likens was often deprived of water. Jenny later speculated, during her court testimony, that Likens was unable to produce tears due to [[dehydration]].&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"/&gt;

On October 22, Likens was forced by John to eat a bowl of soup with her fingers. John quickly took away the bowl when Likens attempted to eat it. Baniszewski eventually allowed her to sleep upstairs, under the condition that she learned not to wet herself. That night, Likens whispered to Jenny to give her a glass of water before falling asleep. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;On October 23, Baniszewski discovered that Likens had urinated herself. As punishment, Likens was forced to masturbate with an empty glass Coca-Cola bottle in front of Baniszewski's children. After that, she stripped Likens naked and [[Human branding|carved]] the words "I'M A PROSTITUTE AND PROUD OF IT" onto Likens' abdomen with a heated needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19651028&amp;id=ZgYrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NZgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6404,6841839&amp;hl=en|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+whipping&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmGToqZfVh&amp;sig=drMzugkCi-YaYiR60-NR5kUjptI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY8sXyie3XAhWLp5QKHb8LC7gQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=october%2022&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Baniszewski was unable to finish the branding, she had Richard Hobbs finish. Hobbs continued to brand Likens as Baniszewski calmly took Jenny to the groceries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hobbs and 10-year-old Shirley Baniszewski then used an [[Fire iron|iron poker]] in an attempt to burn the letter "S" into Likens' chest; the burn scar ended up looking like the number "3."&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"&gt;[http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=177&amp;sid=2d539eaab9268eeaf90fd1f33a10776d] Jenny Fay Likens&lt;/ref&gt; Baniszewski later taunted Likens about how she would never be able to marry a man due to the words carved onto her stomach. Likens was taken back to the basement, where Coy Hubbard arrived to tie her up and slam her body against the walls six to seven times. That night, Likens confided to her sister, "I'm going to die. I can tell". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;The next day, Baniszewski woke Likens, then dictated a letter to her, intending to mislead her parents into believing that she had run away. The letter also tried to frame a group of anonymous boys for abusing and mutilating Likens after she supposedly agreed to have sexual relations with them. After Likens finished the letter, Baniszewski formulated a plan to have John Jr. and Jenny take Sylvia to a nearby forested area and leave her there to die.

On October 25, Likens tried to escape after overhearing Baniszewski's plan to blindfold her&lt;ref name="sylvialikens.com"/&gt; and dump her body in Jimmy's Forest, a wooded area nearby. Likens fled to the front door but due to her extensive injuries, Baniszewski caught her in time. Likens was provided with toast but was unable to eat it due to her severe dehydration. Baniszewski shoved the toast into her mouth and struck her face several times with a curtain rod. She violently threw Likens into the basement and with the assistance of Hubbard, she tied and bludgeoned her until she was unconscious. Likens managed to recover but was unable to speak intelligibly and move her limbs properly. Likens tried to exit the basement but collapsed before she could make it to the stairs. Baniszewski crushed her head with her feet and stood there for several moments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|publisher=Borf Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 26, after multiple beatings, burnings, and scalding baths, Likens died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; She was 16 years old.

When Stephanie Baniszewski and Richard Hobbs realized that Likens was not breathing, Stephanie tried to give her [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. Banzisewski, however, shouted at them that Likens was "faking it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvialikens.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=135|title=Richard Hobbs - Defendant|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Baniszewski finally realized that Likens was dead, she sent Hobbs to call the police from a nearby [[payphone]]. When police arrived, Gertrude Baniszewski handed them the letter she had forced Likens to write a few days previously. Before the police officers left the house, however, Jenny Likens approached them and said, "Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything."&lt;ref name="LETTER"&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/13.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: The Letter Before End] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824165415/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/13.html |date=2008-08-24 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; Her statement, combined with the discovery of Likens' body, prompted the officers to arrest Gertrude, Paula, Stephanie and John Baniszewski, Richard Hobbs, and Coy Hubbard for murder. Other neighborhood children present at the time—Mike Monroe, Randy Lepper, Darlene McGuire, Judy Duke, and Anna Siscoe—were arrested for "injury to person".

==Trial==
[[File:Jenny Fay Likens.jpg|thumb|Jenny Likens watching the proceedings of the Baniszewski trial. She instigated the investigation and the subsequent arrest of her sister's torturers and murderers.]]

Baniszewski, her children, Hobbs, and Hubbard were held without bail pending their trials.

An examination and autopsy of Likens' body revealed numerous burns, bruising, muscle and nerve damage. All of her fingernails were also broken backwards and most of the skin's outer layer peeled off. Her severely mutilated body led authorities to initially believe that it was the work of an "anonymous madman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=PAw1JRwc2zsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=sylvia+likens+autopsy+madman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GmFWmlW7Uh&amp;sig=6hLu6CWNFGw57Ko9l_aoXYzGUKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZsMys-5nWAhXHzbwKHXp1DPIQ6AEIUjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=sylvia%20likens%20autopsy%20madman&amp;f=false|title=The Indiana Torture Slaying: Sylvia Likens' Ordeal and Death|last=Dean|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her death throes, Likens bit through her lips, partially severing each of them. Her vaginal cavity was nearly swollen shut, although an examination of the canal determined that her [[hymen]] was still intact, which meant it was possible she was still a virgin, discrediting Baniszewski's assertions that Likens was a prostitute and her insistence that she was pregnant. The official cause of death was brain swelling, internal hemorrhaging of the brain, and shock from severe and prolonged damage to her skin.

During the highly publicized trial, Gertrude Baniszewski denied being responsible for Likens' death. She pleaded [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. She claimed that she was too distracted by her ill health and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] to control her children.

Four minors who took part in the abuse of Likens were also put on trial. They were:

*Paula Baniszewski, aged 17
*John Baniszewski, aged 13
*Richard Hobbs, aged 15
*Coy Hubbard, aged 15

The attorneys for the minors claimed that they had been pressured by Baniszewski.

When Gertrude's 11-year-old daughter, Marie Baniszewski, was called to the stand as a witness for the defense, she broke down and admitted that she had been forced to heat the needle with which Hobbs had carved Likens' skin. She also testified that she had seen her mother beating Likens and forcing her into the basement.

In his closing statement, Baniszewski's lawyer said: "I condemn her for being a murderess ... but I say she's not responsible because she's not all here!" He tapped his head to make his point about her state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/16.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: Drama in the Court Room] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824121151/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/16.html |date=2008-08-24 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1966, Gertrude Baniszewski was convicted of first-degree [[murder]]. She was spared the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

Paula Baniszewski, who had given birth to a daughter during the trial, was convicted of second-degree murder. She was also sentenced to life imprisonment.

Richard Hobbs, Coy Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr. were all convicted of [[manslaughter]] and given two 2-to-21-year prison sentences.

==Aftermath==
Hobbs, Hubbard, and John Baniszewski Jr. each served two years in a reformatory before being paroled in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "150 Hear Likens Case Sentences," ''The Indianapolis News,'' May 25, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indystar"&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS06/80814026 ''Library Factfiles: The murder of Sylvia Likens.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65aUb7lAe?url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS06%2F80814026# |date=2012-02-20 }} The Indianapolis Star.

In 1971, Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski were granted another trial by the [[Supreme Court of Indiana|Indiana Supreme Court]], largely for reasons of a prejudicial atmosphere due to heavy news media publicity before and during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "Court Orders New Trial in Likens Slaying", ''The Indianapolis Star'', September 2, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Baniszewski pleaded guilty to [[voluntary manslaughter]] and was released from prison one year later.&lt;ref name=IndyStar/&gt; Gertrude Baniszewski, however, was again convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Unnamed author: "Mrs. Baniszewski Meted Life in Likens Slaying", ''The Indianapolis Star'', August 20, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next 14 years, Baniszewski became a model prisoner at the [[Indiana Women's Prison]], working in the sewing shop and becoming a "den mother" to younger female inmates. By the time she came up for parole in 1985, she was known by the prison nickname "Mom".

The news of Baniszewski's parole hearing sent shockwaves through the Indiana community. Jenny Likens and her family appeared on television to speak out against Baniszewski; the members of two anti-crime groups, Protect the Innocent and Society's League Against Molestation, travelled to Indiana to oppose her parole and support the Likens family, beginning a sidewalk picket campaign. Over the course of two months, the groups collected over 40,000 signatures from the citizens of Indiana, including those who were too young to remember the case, demanding that Baniszewski be kept behind bars.&lt;ref&gt;Caleca, Linda Graham: "Baniszewski Ruling Won't Affect Past Parole Cases, Judge Says", ''The Indianapolis Star'', October 30, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mermel, Marcy: "Mrs. Baniszewski Portrayed as a New Woman", ''The Indianapolis News'', December 3, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efforts, Baniszewski was granted parole. During the hearing, she stated: "I'm not sure what role I had in it ... because I was on drugs. I never really knew her ... I take full responsibility for whatever happened to Sylvia." The [[parole board]], taking her [[Good conduct time|good behavior]] in prison into account, voted in favor of granting Baniszewski's freedom 3–2, and she was released.

[[File:Gertrude-baniszewski002.jpg|thumb|Gertrude Baniszewski after leaving jail, aged 56.]]

Baniszewski was released from prison on December 4, 1985, and traveled to [[Iowa]], where she called herself Nadine Van Fossan, using her middle name and maiden name. She lived in obscurity until her death in [[Laurel, Iowa]], from [[lung cancer]], on June 16, 1990, aged 60.&lt;ref name="indystar"/&gt;

When Jenny Likens, who was then married and living in [[Beech Grove, Indiana]], saw Gertrude Baniszewski's obituary in a newspaper, she clipped it and mailed it to her mother with the note: "Some good news.

After the [[Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden|Westside Middle School massacre]], John Baniszewski Jr., by then calling himself John Blake, made a statement claiming that young criminals are not beyond help and describing how he had turned his life around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens: In Memoriam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930100521/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |date=2012-09-30 }}; Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] at General Hospital in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], on May 19, 2005, at the age of 52.

The murder charge against Gertrude Baniszewski's second-eldest daughter, Stephanie (aged 15), was dropped after she [[Turn state's evidence|turned state's evidence]] against the other defendants. She assumed a new name and became a school teacher. She married and has several children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Noe |first=Denise |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |title=The Torturing Death of Sylvia Marie Likens — In Memoriam — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930100521/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/likens/18.html |archive-date=2012-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The injury-to-person charges against the younger juveniles, Anna Ruth Siscoe, Judy Darlene Duke, Michael John (Mike) Monroe, Darlene McGuire, and Randy Gordon Lepper, were dropped. Siscoe married and had children and grandchildren; she died on October 23, 1996 at the age of 44. Lepper died on November 14, 2010 in [[Indianapolis]] at the age of 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/indystar/obituary.aspx?n=randy-g-lepper&amp;pid=151636716#fbLoggedOut |title=THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR OBITUARIES: Complete listing of The Indianapolis Star Obituaries powered by Legacy.com |publisher=indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2015, Likens' sister Diana (who was using the name Dianna Bedwell) and her husband, Cecil Knutson, were reported missing by their son, Robert Acosta. Dianna and Cecil had been gambling at the [[San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians|Valley View Casino]] in [[Valley Center, California]]. Surveillance video recorded the couple leaving the casino at about 2 p.m. by car, but they did not show up at their son's house in [[La Quinta, California|La Quinta]]. Acosta contacted the police and appeared on television, asking the public's help in finding his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/05/13/sylvia-likens-older-sister-vanishes-california/27232635/|title=Archives: Sylvia Likens' older sister vanishes in California|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2015, the couple was found in a mountainous area of an Indian reservation by members of a volunteer Jeep patrol. Cecil was dead and Dianna was severely dehydrated after surviving on just rainwater and some food. Dianna was airlifted to a hospital in serious condition. She told investigators they were looking for a shortcut when they got lost and became stuck on a rugged road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2015445/elderly-missing-couple-found-in-california-husband-dead/ |title=Elderly missing couple found in California, husband dead |publisher=globalnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house at 3850 East New York Street in which Likens was tortured and murdered stood vacant and rundown for many years after the murder. Although there was some discussion of purchasing it for renovation and using it as a [[women's shelter]], the necessary funds were never raised. The house was demolished on April 23, 2009. The property is now a church parking lot.

[[Image:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|17th century cloth painting depicting seven levels of Jain hell and various tortures suffered in them. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over the each hell.]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Naraka''' ([[Sanskrit]]: नरक) is the realm of existence in [[Jain cosmology]] characterized by great suffering. [[Naraka]] is usually translated into English as "[[hell]]" or "[[purgatory]]". However, Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years.  A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.

==Types of hells==
These realms are situated in the seven lower levels (''adho lok'') of the universe while the human abode of [[Jambudvip]] is in the middle (''madhya lok'') and the heavenly realms exist above (''urdhva loka''). These layers together, form the shape of a man with arms akimbo (the familiar 'keyhole' shaped emblem of Jainism), with the human realm of Jambudvip at the waist, ''adho lok'' below, ''urdhva lok'' above, and ''siddha lok'' or ''[[siddhashila]]'' (the realm of the [[siddhas]]) at or above the head. Many Jain temples are built to display this cosmology such Jambudvip in Hastinapur and the fifteen story [[Trilok Teerth Dham]] temple in Uttar Pradesh. The seven lower grounds are:

# Ratna prabha.
# Sharkara prabha.
# Valuka prabha.
# Panka prabha.
# Dhuma prabha.
# Tamaha prabha.
# Mahatamaha prabha.

The first ground, owing to a predominance of ''ratnas'' or jewels, is called ''Ratnaprabha''. Similarly, the second, owing to a predominance of ''sarkara'' or gravel, is called ''Sarkraprabha''. The third owing to a predominance of ''valuka'' or sands, is called ''Valukaprabha''. The fourth, owing to an excess of ''panka'' or mud, is called ''Pankaprabha''. The fifth, owing to an excess of ''dhuma'' or smoke, is called ''Dhumaprabha''. The sixth, owing to a marked possession of ''tamas'' or darkness, is called ''Tamahprabha'', while the seventh, owing to a high concentration of ''mahatamas'' or dense darkness, is called ''Mahatamahprabha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit|pages=133-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellish beings==
The hellish beings ({{lang-sa|नारकीय}}, ''{{transl|sa|Nārakī}}'') are a type of soul which reside in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit}} pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The hellish beings each possess a ''vaikriya''  body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span in the respective hells where they reside. The minimum life span of hellish beings in the first to seventh hellish grounds is 10000 years, 1 ''sagaropama'' year (Ocean-measured years which are countless years as per [[Jain cosmology]]),&lt;ref group=note&gt;As per the [[Jain cosmology]] ''Sirsapahelika'' is the highest measurable number in Jainism which is 10^194 years. Higher than that is palyopama (pit measured years) which is explained by an analogy of a pit. Accordingly, a hollow pit of 8 x 8 x 8 miles tightly filled with hair particles of seven day old newly born. [A single hair from the above cut into eight pieces seven times = 20,97,152 Particles]. 1 Particle emptied after every 100 years, the time taken to empty the whole pit = 1 Palyopama. (1 Palyopama = countless years.) Hence palyopama is at least greater than 10^194 years. Sagrapoma is 10 Quadrillion Palyopama, that means a Sagrapoma is more than 10^210 Years&lt;/ref&gt; 3 ''sagaropama'' years, 7 ''sagaropama'' years, 10 ''sagaropama'' years, 17 ''sagaropama'' years and 22 ''sagaropama'' years respectively. The maximum life span of hellish beings in the first to sixth hellish grounds is 1 ''sagaropama'' year, 3 ''sagaropama'' years, 7 ''sagaropama'' years, 10 ''sagaropama'' years, 17 ''sagaropama'' years and 22 ''sagaropama'' years respectively. They experience five types of sufferings: bodily pain, inauspicious ''[[Lesya|leśyā]] '' or soul colouring and pariṇāma or physical transformation, from the nature and location of hells, pain inflicted on one other and torture inflicted by mansion-dwelling demi-gods.

==Causes of birth in Hell==
{{Main|Causes of karma in Jainism#Causes of the Narakayus karma or birth in hells}}

In a dialogue between [[Sudharma Swami]] and [[Mahavira]] in the [[Jain text]] [[Sutrakritanga]], [[Mahavira]] speaks of various reasons a soul may take birth in hells:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] | title =The Sūtrakritanga | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1895 | location =Oxford | language =English| url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe45/index.htm | series =[[Sacred Books of the East|Sacred Books of the East vol.45, Part 2]] | isbn =0-7007-1538-X }} verse SK:5.1.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Sudharma Swami''': What is the punishment in the hells? Knowing it, O sage, tell it me who do not know it! How do sinners go to hell?
: '''Mahavira''': I shall describe the truly insupportable pains where there is distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings for the sake of his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run. Going to a place like a burning heap of coals on fire, and being burnt they cry horribly; they remain there long, shrieking aloud.

According to Jain scripture, [[Tattvarthasutra]], following are the causes for birth in hell:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52&lt;/ref&gt;

#Killing or causing pain with intense passion.
#Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.
#Vowless and unrestrained life.&lt;ref&gt;refer [[Mahavrata]] for the vows and restraints in Jainism&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punishment in Hells.jpg|thumb|300px|Tortures in the hells]]

In a dialogue between Sudharma and Mahavira the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira describes various tortures and sufferings in hells:{{sfn|Jacobi|1895|p=verse SK:5.1.8-27}}
:They cross the horrible [[Vaitarani]], being urged on by arrows, and wounded with spears. The punishers pierce them with darts; they go in the boat, losing their memory; others pierce them with long pikes and tridents, and throw them on the ground. Some, round whose neck big stones are tied, are drowned in deep water. Others again roll about in the Kadambavâlukâ (river) or in burning chaff, and are roasted in it.  And they come to the great impassable hell, full of agony, called Asûrya (i.e. where the sun does not shine), where there is great darkness, where fires, placed above, below, and all around, are blazing. There, as in a cave, being roasted on the fire, he is burned, having lost the reminiscence (of his sins) and consciousness of everything else; always suffering (he comes) to that miserable hot place that is ever ready (for the punishment of evildoers) There the cruel punishers have lighted four fires, and roast the sinners; they are roasted there like fishes put on the fire alive.
:The prisoners in hell come to the dreadful place called Santakshana (i.e. cutting), where the cruel punishers tie their hands and feet, and with axes in their hands cut them like wooden planks. And they turn the writhing victims round, and stew them, like living fishes, in an iron caldron filled with their own blood, their limbs covered with ordure, their heads smashed.

In Hell beings have a life span of innumerable years and are not easily killed even though they endure great torture. Even if they are killed they immediately take birth and are then repeatedly killed. This is described as thus:
:They are not reduced to ashes there, and they do not die of their enormous pains; undergoing this punishment, the miserable men suffer for their misdeeds. And there in the place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the tormentors torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished).
:They deprive the sinner of his life; I shall truly tell you how this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) punishment (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) for the sake of small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.

The '''Open Christmas Letter''' was a public message for [[peace]] addressed "To the Women of Germany and Austria",&lt;ref name=Oldfield46&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; signed by a group of 101 British [[Women's suffrage|suffragists]]&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, 2008, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of the [[First World War]] approached. The Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to American feminist [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], the president of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in ''Jus Suffragii'', the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were [[Pacifism|pacifists]]. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared, [[Women's suffrage|suffrage for women]].

The decision by some suffragists to speak out against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favour of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would think more highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organisations or with refugee aid societies. Nearly all suffragists agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war partial suffrage was granted, for property-holding women aged 30 and over.

==Background==
[[File:Hobhouse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emily Hobhouse]] authored the Open Christmas Letter and circulated it for signatures.]]
From 1906 until mid-1914, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the United Kingdom was the party seen as most supportive of [[women's suffrage]]—the right of women to vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;Archive Awareness Campaign. ''From Kitchen Table to Cabinet Table.'' [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4.html "Women, the Vote and Labour 1906–1918." page 1.] [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4_2.html Page 2.] [http://www.politicalwomen.org.uk/cs4_3.html Page 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting them the right to vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF).&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

Like the NUWSS, the more militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] travelled to [[Glasgow]] and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that "peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats".&lt;ref name=Winslow&gt;Winslow, Barbara. ''Sylvia Pankhurst: sexual politics and political activism'', p. 81. Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|1-85728-345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker's Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

==German suffragists==
[[File:Anita Augspurg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[:de:Anita Augspurg|Anita Augspurg]], German lawyer and activist, sent a letter to the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] in late 1914.]]
In ''Jus Suffragii'' in December 1914, Carrie Chapman Catt published a letter that she had received earlier from [[:de:Anita Augspurg|Anita Augspurg]], [[:de:Lida Gustava Heymann|Lida Gustava Heymann]], and several other German women activists including presidents of woman suffrage societies in Germany. The letter was entitled "To the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, through its president, Mrs. Chapman Catt."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It began, "To the women of all nations warm and hearty greetings in these wretched and bloody times."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt; The German women expressed that the "criminally rekindled war" should not separate women from all countries who had previously been united "by the common striving for the highest object—personal and political freedom".&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt; They stated that "True humanity knows no national hatred, no national contempt. Women are nearer to true humanity than men."&lt;ref name=Oldfield25/&gt;

Catt published another letter from German women's rights activist [[Clara Zetkin]], one that expressed the desire for all women not to let "the thunder of guns and the shouts of the [[Jingoism|jingoes]]" make them forget that the rise of civilisation amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that the women of the world should guard their children against the "hollow din" of "cheap racial pride" which filled the streets, and that "the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite".&lt;ref name=Oldfield24&gt;Oldfield, 2003, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British suffragists==
[[File:Margaret Bondfield 1919.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Margaret Bondfield]] signed the Open Christmas Letter but was unable to travel to [[The Hague]] in April 1915.]]
In response to the letters from Germany, [[Emily Hobhouse]] organised the writing and signing of a peace-promoting letter from British women: the Open Christmas Letter.&lt;ref name=Oldfield60&gt;Oldfield, 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, [[Emily Hobhouse|Hobhouse]] campaigned against and worked to change the appalling conditions inside the British [[concentration camp]]s in South Africa built for [[Boer]] women and children during the [[Second Boer War]]. She saw in the German letters the opportunity for maintaining vital international relations among women who could help mitigate the damage that war would bring. She wrote what she called a "Letter of Christmas Greeting" in November 1914 and circulated it for signatures of women who wished for peace.&lt;ref name=Foreword&gt;Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (First Congress: 1915: The Hague) ''Bericht—Rapport—Report'', Foreword by Emily Hobhouse, pp. ix–xii. Amsterdam: International Women's Committee of Permanent Peace, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; Pankhurst and [[Helen Bright Clark]] were among the first to sign Hobhouse's plea for continued sisterhood among the women of the world.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;

Others among the 101 signers were [[Margaret Ashton]], [[Margaret Bondfield]],&lt;ref name=Rappaport98&gt;Rappaport, 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eva Gore-Booth]], [[Esther Roper]], [[Maude Royden]], [[Helena Swanwick]], and a wide range of women united by the wish for "undiminished sisterly relations"&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt; and a swift end to hostilities.&lt;ref name=Liddington&gt;Liddington, Jill. ''The road to Greenham Common: feminism and anti-militarism in Britain since 1820'', p. 96. Syracuse University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8156-2539-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included among the women were some who were members of the Women's Labour League, and some of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. One of the listed women was "Mrs. M. K. Gandhi" but it is unknown whether [[Kasturba Gandhi]], the wife of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], asked that her name be included. At least one of the signers was an American: Florence Edgar Hobson was the New York-born wife of English Liberal social theorist and economist [[John A. Hobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Peter.

===Message===
Under the heading "On Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men",&lt;ref name=Oldfield46/&gt; the letter's salutation addressed "Sisters" and began, "Some of us wish to send you a word at this sad [[Christmastide]], though we can but speak through the Press..."&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The women of the UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which was at that time a neutral nation. The letter continued, "The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do."&lt;ref name=Oldfield46/&gt; The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913, "the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight".&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not our mission to preserve life? Do not humanity and common sense alike prompt us to join hands with the women of neutral countries, and urge our rulers to stay further bloodshed? ...&lt;br /&gt;Even through the clash of arms, we treasure [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|our poet's]] vision, and already seem to hear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"A hundred nations swear that there shall be&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pity and Peace and Love among the good and free."&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley, Percy Bysshe]]. [http://www.bartleby.com/139/shel11325.html The Revolt in Islam. A Poem in Twelve Cantos. Canto Fifth.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Christmas hasten that day...&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Response==
[[File:Rosa Mayreder, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rosa Mayreder]] from [[Austria]] signed the reply.]]
In the spring of 1915, the letter was answered in kind by 155 Germanic feminists including Augspurg and Heymann who had sent the earlier letter from Germany. [[Margarethe Lenore Selenka]], [[Minna Cauer]], and [[Helene Stöcker]] were among the German signers; [[Rosa Mayreder]], Marianne Fickert, Ernestine Federn, and [[:de:Ernestine von Fürth|Ernestine von Fürth]] were in the group of Austrian signers.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The response was entitled "Open Letter in Reply to the Open Christmas Letter from Englishwomen to German
and Austrian Women"&lt;ref name=Oldfield67&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in ''Jus Suffragii'' on 1 March 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmers, 2008, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To our English sisters, sisters of the same race, we express in the name of many German women our warm and heartfelt thanks for their Christmas greetings, which we only heard of lately.&lt;br /&gt;This message was a confirmation of what we foresaw—that women of the belligerent countries, with all faithfulness, devotion, and love to their country, can go beyond it and maintain true solidarity with the women of other belligerent nations, and that really civilised women never lose their humanity...&lt;ref name=Oldfield67/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Peace initiatives==
[[File:Carrie Chapman Catt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carrie Chapman Catt]] aided the interchange of peace wishes between women of warring nations.]]
Directly after war broke out in August 1914, [[Rosika Schwimmer]], a native of [[Austria–Hungary]] working in England but prevented by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations.&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt; In September 1914, [[:de:Marie Stritt|Marie Stritt]], president of the German Union for Woman Suffrage, wrote to [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] in America with "deep personal regret" for the "terrible war" to say that the women of Germany must withdraw their invitation to the annual IWSA International Alliance meeting in June 1915 which was to convene in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Oldfield18&gt;Oldfield, 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1914 [[Julia Grace Wales]], a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]], expanded eloquently on the concept, and published her views in a pamphlet entitled "Continuous Mediation Without Armistice", popularly known as the [[Wisconsin Plan]].&lt;ref name=WisconsinPlan&gt;Wisconsin Historical Society. Teachers' Lessons. [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/teachers/lessons/wwi/pdfs/prewarpulsepackage.pdf "Teacher Background—Julia Grace Wales and the Peace Movement"]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, instead of holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in [[The Hague]] for four days beginning 28 April 1915.&lt;ref name=Foreword/&gt;

When this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Fawcett and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded—they were primarily concerned with helping the UK men win the war.&lt;ref name=Liddington/&gt; The NUWSS membership rejected a resolution favoured by [[Helen Bright Clark]] and [[Margaret Bondfield]]&lt;ref name=Rappaport98/&gt; which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Margaret Ashton resigned from the NUWSS and was subsequently censured by her local [[Manchester]] branch of suffragists.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague.&lt;ref name=Crawford668&gt;Crawford, 2001, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

At The Hague, between 28 April and 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals.&lt;ref name=WASM&gt;Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000. Editorials. [http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/hague/intro.htm "How Did Women Activists Promote Peace in Their 1915 Tour of Warring European Capitals?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The event was called the [[International Congress of Women]], or the Women's Peace Congress. A planned contingent of 180 British women was greatly reduced to just three persons by the government cancellation of British ferry service across the [[English Channel]], stranding Royden and Swanwick, among others.&lt;ref name=Crawford668/&gt; Having already travelled to [[Flushing, Netherlands]] on a mission of mercy in late October 1914 to provide food for refugees from the [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|fall of Antwerp]], [[Chrystal Macmillan]] was able to attend the women's conference and speak for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, January 2008. MacTutor Biographies. [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Printonly/MacMillan_Chrystal.html Jessie Chrystal MacMillan]. University of St. Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan, a signer of the Open Christmas Letter, had previously resigned from the NUWSS when its refusal to stand against the war had become clear. Macmillan was selected as one of the international committee who would travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world,&lt;ref name=WisconsinPlan/&gt; and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President [[Woodrow Wilson]] with the plan. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his [[Fourteen Points]], and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=WASM/&gt;

==Women's suffrage==
During the war, with British suffragists abstaining from taking militant action, British statesmen such as Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] began to have a change of heart regarding their right to vote. In early 1917 a clause which provided suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 years and older was debated, and in June it was attached to the bill which would later become the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. Suffragists who were pacifists and suffragists who were nationalistic could both congratulate themselves for winning this incremental victory. Ten years later full voting equality with men was achieved in the UK with the [[Representation of the People Act 1928]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''participation''' is the [[:wikt:inverse|inverse]] of [[inherence]].

==Overview==
[[Accident (philosophy)|Accidents]] are said to ''inhere'' in [[Substance theory|substance]].  Substances, in turn, ''participate'' in their accidents.  For example, the color red is said to inhere in the red apple.  Conversely, the red apple participates in the color red.

Participation also is predicated by [[analogy]] to a dependence relations between accidents.  Thus an act may be said to participate in time in the sense that every act must occur at some time.  In a similar way, color may be said to inhere in space, meaning that a color occurs only on the surface of a body—and thus only in space.

Inherence, on the other hand, would not normally be predicated analogously of accidents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">{{Redirect|Product of categories|the operation on objects of a category|Product (category theory)}}

In the mathematical field of [[category theory]], the '''product''' of two categories ''C'' and ''D'', denoted {{nowrap| ''C'' × ''D''}} and called a '''product category''', is an extension of the concept of the [[Cartesian product]] of two sets. Product categories are used to define [[Functor#Bifunctors and multifunctors|bifunctors and multifunctors]].{{sfn|Mac Lane|1978}}

==Definition==
The product category {{nowrap| ''C'' × ''D''}} has:
*as objects:
*:pairs of objects {{nowrap| (''A'', ''B'')}}, where ''A'' is an object of ''C'' and ''B'' of ''D'';
*as arrows from {{nowrap| (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} to  {{nowrap| (''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}:
*:pairs of arrows {{nowrap| (''f'', ''g'')}}, where {{nowrap| ''f'' : ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an arrow of ''C'' and {{nowrap| ''g'' : ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an arrow of ''D'';
*as composition, component-wise composition from the contributing categories:
*:{{nowrap|1= (''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}};
*as identities, pairs of identities from the contributing categories:
*:1&lt;sub&gt;(''A'', ''B'')&lt;/sub&gt; = (1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Relation to other categorical concepts==
For [[small category|small categories]], this is the same as the action on objects of the [[categorical product]] in the category '''[[Category of small categories|Cat]]'''. A [[functor]] whose domain is a product category is known as a [[bifunctor]]. An important example is the [[Hom functor]], which has the product of the [[Dual (category theory)|opposite]] of some category with the original category as domain:

:Hom : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; × ''C'' → '''Set'''.

==Generalization to several arguments==
Just as the binary Cartesian product is readily generalized to an [[Cartesian product#n-ary product|''n''-ary Cartesian product]], binary product of two categories can be generalized, completely analogously, to a product of ''n'' categories. The product operation on categories is commutative and associative, [[up to isomorphism]], and so this generalization brings nothing new from a theoretical point of view.

A '''recursive transition network''' ("RTN") is a [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] [[schematic]] used to represent the rules of a [[context-free grammar]]. RTNs have application to [[programming language]]s, [[natural language]] and [[lexical analysis]]. Any [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that is constructed according to the rules of an RTN&lt;ref&gt;A sentence is generated by a RTN by applying the generative rules specified in the RTN itself. These represent any set of rules or a function consisting of a finite number of steps.&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be "well-formed". The structural elements of a well-formed sentence may also be well-formed sentences by themselves, or they may be simpler structures. This is why RTNs are described as [[Recursion|recursive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10928">[[Truth]] is most often used to mean being in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]], or fidelity to an original or standard.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; '''Religious views on truth''' vary between [[religion]]s.

==Buddhism==
===The Four Noble Truths===
{{main|Four Noble Truths}}
The Four Noble Truths are the most fundamental [[Buddhist]] teachings and appear countless times throughout the most ancient Buddhist texts, the [[Pali Canon]]. They arose from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s [[bodhi|enlightenment]] and are regarded in Buddhism as deep spiritual insight, ''not as philosophical theory'', with Buddha noting in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]: "These Four Noble Truths, monks, are actual, unerring, not otherwise. Therefore, they are called noble truths."&lt;ref name = "noble1"&gt;''The Collected Discourses of the Buddha: A new translation of the Samyutta Nikaya'', Bhikkhu Bodhi, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four Noble Truths (''Catvāry Āryasatyāni'') are as follows: 
# The truth that suffering exists ([[Dukkha]]).
# The truth that suffering exists with a root cause ([[Tanha|craving]]).
# The truth that suffering can be eliminated ([[Nirvana]]).
# The truth that there is a way to eliminate suffering known as the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

===Two Truths Doctrine===
{{main|Two truths doctrine}}
The two truths doctrine in [[Buddhism]] differentiates between two levels of [[truth]] in Buddhist [[discourse]], a "relative", or commonsense truth (Tibetan: ''kun-rdzob bden-pa''; Sanskrit: ''samvrtisatya''), and an  "ultimate" or absolute spiritual truth  (Tibetan: ''don-dam bden-pa''; Sanskrit: ''paramarthasatya''). Stated differently, the Two Truths Doctrine holds that truth exists in conventional and ultimate forms, and that both forms are co-existent. Other schools, such as [[Dzogchen]], hold that the Two Truths Doctrine are ultimately resolved into nonduality as a lived experience and are non-different.  The doctrine is an especially important element of [[Buddhism]] and was first expressed in complete modern form by [[Nagarjuna]], who based it on the ''[[Kaccāyanagotta Sutta]]''.

==Christianity==
{{see also|John 18:38}}
[[Image:What_is_truth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nikolai Ge]]'s ''What is Truth?'', depicting the [[New Testament]] account of the question as posed by Pilate to Jesus.]]
[[Image:IQueEsLaVerita.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pontius Pilate]]'s "[[John 18:38|What is Truth?]]" - stylized inscription at entrance to [[Antoni Gaudi]]'s [[Sagrada Família]] ([[Barcelona]]).]]
Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] notes that the Bible typically uses the words true or truth in non-philosophical senses to indicate such qualities as fidelity, moral rectitude, and reality. However, it does sometimes use the word in the [[philosophical]] sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Are There Objective Truths about God?|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/are-there-objective-truths-about-god|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe that other authorities are sources of doctrinal truth. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that the [[Papal infallibility|Pope is infallible]] when pronouncing on certain, rather specific, matters of [[Christian Church|church]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Richard F. Costigan, ''The Consensus Of The Church And Papal Infallibility: A Study In The Background Of Vatican I'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian Science]], (not recognised as a Christian organization by the bulk of mainstream churches) Truth is God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth Truth - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The Magisterium of the Church===
{{Main|Sacred tradition}}
The [[magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]] is the church's authority or office to establish teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/magisterium Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ignatius&gt;[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2007/tstorck_magisterium_may07.asp Thomas Stork, "What Is the Magisterium?"]&lt;/ref&gt; That authority is vested uniquely in the [[Pope]] and the bishops, under the premise that they are in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the correct and true teachings of the faith which is shown in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope and to the college of bishops in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with Him" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PN.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 100])&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred scripture and sacred tradition "make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which is entrusted to the Church",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation ''Dei verbum'', 10]&lt;/ref&gt; and the magisterium is not independent of this, since "all that it proposes for belief as being [[Revelation|divinely revealed]] is derived from this single deposit of faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PM.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical inerrancy===
{{Main|Biblical inerrancy|Biblical infallibility|Biblical literalism}}
Biblical inerrancy, as formulated in the "[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]]", is the [[doctrine]] that the [[Protestant Bible]] "is without error or fault in all its teaching";&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, NL. and Roach, B., ''Defending Inerrancy: Affirming the Accuracy of Scripture for a New Generation, Baker Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or, at least, that "Scripture in the original [[Manuscript|manuscripts]] does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact".&lt;ref name="Grudem90"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A.|last=Grudem|authorlink=Wayne Grudem|title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine|publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]]|location=[[Leicester]]|year=1994|page=90|isbn=978-0-85110-652-6|oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various interpretations have been applied, depending on the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.''  Norman L. Geisler, ''Inerrancy'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Davis, ''The debate about the Bible: Inerrancy versus infallibility'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations of the doctrine, ''all'' of the Bible is without error, i.e., is to be taken as true, no matter what the issue. Other interpretations hold that the Bible is always true on important matters of [[faith]], while other interpretations hold that the Bible is true but must be specifically interpreted in the context of the [[language]], [[culture]] and time that relevant passages were written.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'' Marcus J. Borg, ''Reading the Bible Again For the First Time: Taking the Bible Seriously But Not Literally'' (2002) 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
Generally, truthfulness relates to speech: to speak only what one has seen, heard or understood, however the essence of truthfulness is far deeper in [[Hinduism]]: it is defined as upholding the central concept of righteousness.&lt;ref name="hindu1"&gt;Truth Alone Will Triumph, [http://www.akhand-jyoti.org/ArticlesMarApr03/Truth.html Akhand-Jyoti.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Upanishads]] of ancient India, truth is ''Sat'' (pronounced Sah't), the One Reality and Existence, which is directly experienced when the vision is cleared of [[dross]]. The Rishi discovers what exists, ''Sat'', as the truth of one's own Being, the Self or ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]]'', and as the truth of the Being of God, [[Ishvara]]. In this usage, the term truth is used to refer to not merely a derived quality "true rather than false", but the true state of being, truth as what really is there. This is described by Ramana Maharshi: "There is no greater mystery than that we keep seeking reality, though, in fact, we are reality."

==Jainism==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Although, historically, [[Jainism|Jain]] authors have adopted different views on truth, the most prevalent is the system of ''[[anekantavada]]'' or "not-one-sidedness". This idea of truth is rooted in the notion that there is one truth, but only enlightened beings can perceive it in its entirety; unenlightened beings perceive only one side of the truth (''ekanta''). ''Anekantavada'' works around the limitations of a one-sided view of truth by proposing multiple vantage points (''nayas'') from which truth can be viewed (cf. ''[[Anekantavada#Nayavāda|Nayavāda]]''). Recognizing that there are multiple possible truths about any particular thing, even mutually exclusive truths, Jain philosophers developed a system for synthesizing these various claims, known as ''[[syadvada]]''. Within the system of ''syadvada'', each truth is qualified to its particular view-point; that is "in a certain way", one claim or another or both may be true.

==Judaism==
There is no unilateral agreement among the different denominations of Judaism concerning truth. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], truth is the revealed word of God, as found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and to a lesser extent, in the words of the sages of the [[Talmud]]. For [[Hasidic]] Jews truth is also found in the pronouncements of their [[rebbe]], or spiritual leader, who is believed to possess [[divine inspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebbe#Relationship of chasidim to their rebbe|Relationship of chasidim to their rebbe]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kotzk, a Polish Hasidic sect, was known for their obsession with truth.

In [[Conservative Judaism]], truth is not defined as literally as it is among the Orthodox. While Conservative Judaism acknowledges the truth of the [[Tanakh]], generally, it does not accord that status to every single statement or word contained therein, as do the Orthodox. Moreover, unlike Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism believes that the nature of truth can vary from generation to generation, depending on circumstances. For instance, with respect to ''[[halakha]]'', or Jewish law, Conservative Judaism believes that it can be modified or adapted depending on the needs of the people. In Orthodox Judaism, by contrast, the ''halakha'' is fixed (by the sages of the Talmud and later authorities); the present-day task, therefore, is to interpret the ''halakha'', but not to change it.

[[Reform Judaism]] takes a much more liberal approach to truth. It does not hold that truth is found only in the Tanakh; rather, there are kernels of truth to be found in practically every religious tradition. Moreover, its attitude towards the Tanakh is, at best, a document parts of which may have been inspired, but with no particular monopoly on truth, or in any way legally binding.

== History ==
RepRap was founded in 2005 by Dr [[Adrian Bowyer]], a Senior Lecturer in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Bath]] in England. Funding was obtained from the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]].

On 13 September 2006, the RepRap 0.2 prototype successfully printed the first part of itself, which were subsequently used to replace an identical part originally created by a commercial 3D printer. On 9 February 2008, RepRap 1.0 "Darwin" successfully made at least one instance of over half its total rapid-prototyped parts. On 14 April 2008, possibly the first end-user item is made by a RepRap: a clamp to hold an [[iPod]] securely to the dashboard of a [[Ford Fiesta]]. By September of that year it was reported that at least 100 copies have been produced in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Power |url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/09/mechanical_generation.php |title=Mechanical Generation § |publisher=Seedmagazine |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In April 2009 electronic circuit boards were produced automatically with a RepRap, using an automated control system and a swappable head system capable of printing both plastic and conductive solder. On 2 October 2009, the second generation design, called "Mendel", printed its first part. The Mendel's shape resembles a [[triangular prism]] rather than a cube. RepRap 2.0 "Mendel" was completed in October 2009. On 27 January 2010, the [[Foresight Institute]] announced the "Kartik M. Gada Humanitarian Innovation Prize" for the design and construction of an improved RepRap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gada Prizes|url=http://humanityplus.org/projects/gadaprize/|publisher=humanity+|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation design, "Huxley", was officially named on 31 August 2010. Development is based on a miniaturized version of the Mendel hardware with 30% of the original print volume.
Within two years, RepRap and [[#Construction|RepStrap]] building and usage were widespread within the tech, gadget, and engineering communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ingeniøren | url=http://ing.dk/tema/3d-print| publisher= Ingeniøren media | date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-09-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the first successful Delta design, Rostock, had a radically different design.  The latest iterations used [[OpenBeam]]s, wires (typically Dyneema or Spectra fishing lines) instead of belts, and so forth, which also represented some of the latest trends in RepRaps.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In early January 2016 RepRapPro (short for "RepRap Professional", and one commercial arm of the RepRap project in the UK) announced that they are to cease trading on 15 January 2016. The reason given was congestion of the market for low-cost 3D printers and the inability to expand in that market. RepRapPro China continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reprappro.com |title=RepRap Professional Ltd. is now closed. |date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the project was designed by Dr Bowyer to encourage evolution, many variations have been created.&lt;ref name="RepRap Family Tree"&gt;[http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Family_Tree RepRap Family Tree]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chulilla | first1 = J.

== Software ==
[[File:Adrian Bowyer - PopTech 2007.webm|thumb|Adrian Bowyer talking about the RepRap Project at [[Poptech]] 2007]]RepRap has been conceived as a complete replication system rather than simply a piece of hardware. To this end the system includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) in the form of a [[3D modeling]] system and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software and drivers that convert RepRap users' designs into a set of instructions to the RepRap hardware that turns them into physical objects.

Initially two different CAM toolchains had been developed for the RepRap. The first, simply titled "RepRap Host", was written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] by lead RepRap developer Adrian Bowyer. The second, "Skeinforge",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120711231626/http://fabmetheus.crsndoo.com/wiki/index.php/Skeinforge Skeinforge]&lt;/ref&gt; was written independently by Enrique Perez. Both are complete systems for translating 3D computer models into [[G-code]], the machine language that commands the printer.

Later, other programs like [[slic3r]], [[pronterface]],&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/kliment/Printrun&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cura (software)|Cura]],&lt;ref&gt;https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software&lt;/ref&gt;  were created. Recently, Franklin firmware&lt;ref&gt;Github download https://github.com/mtu-most/franklin&lt;/ref&gt; was created to allow RepRap 3-D printers to be used as general purposes 3-D robots in addition to 3-D printing (e.g. milling, fluid handling, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Wijnen, B., Anzalone, G. C., Haselhuhn, A.S., Sanders, P.G., Pearce, J. M. Free and Open-source Control Software for 3-D Motion and Processing. ''Journal of Open Research Software'', 4: e2, DOI:10.5334/jors.78 [https://www.academia.edu/20974474/Free_and_Open-source_Control_Software_for_3-D_Motion_and_Processing free access]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The closed source [[KISSlicer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kisslicer.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[repetier host]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-host/&lt;/ref&gt; are also used.

Free and open-source 3-D modeling programs like [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[OpenSCAD]], and [[FreeCAD]] are preferred 3-D modeling programs in general for the RepRap community but, virtually any CAD or 3D modeling program can be used with the RepRap, as long as it is capable of producing [[STL (file format)|STL]] files.(slic3r also supports [[Wavefront .obj file|.obj]] and [[Additive Manufacturing File Format|.amf]] files). Thus, content creators make use of any tools they are familiar with, whether they are commercial CAD programs, such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[Autodesk AutoCAD]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], [[Autodesk 123D Design]], [[Tinkercad]], or [[SketchUp]] along with the libre software.

== Replication materials ==
[[File:Robot 3D print timelapse on RepRapPro Fisher.webm|thumb|A timelapse video of a robot model (logo of [[Make (magazine)|Make magazine]]) being printed using FDM on a [[RepRap Fisher]], a delta-style printer.]]RepRaps print objects from [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA), [[Nylon]] (possibly not all extruders capable), [[HDPE]], [[thermoplastic elastomer|TPE]] and similar [[thermoplastic]]s.

Polylactic acid (PLA) has the engineering advantages of high stiffness, minimal warping, and an attractive translucent colour. It is also biodegradable and plant-derived.

The mechanical properties of RepRap printed PLA and ABS have been tested and have been shown to be equivalent to the [[tensile strengths]] of proprietary printers.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Tymrak, M. Kreiger, [[J. M. Pearce]] "Mechanical properties of components fabricated with open-source 3-D printers under realistic environmental conditions" ''Materials &amp; Design'', 58, pp. 242-246 (2014).  doi 10.1016/j.matdes.2014.02.038. [https://www.academia.edu/6209168/Mechanical_properties_of_components_fabricated_with_open-source_3-D_printers_under_realistic_environmental_conditions open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in most commercial machines, RepRap users are encouraged to experiment with printing new materials and methods, and to publish their results. Methods for printing novel materials (such as ceramics) have been developed this way. In addition, several [[RecycleBots]] have been designed and fabricated to convert waste plastic, such as shampoo containers and milk jugs, into inexpensive RepRap filament.&lt;ref name="RPJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baechler | first1 = Christian | last2 = DeVuono | first2 = Matthew | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock | url = https://www.academia.edu/2643418/Distributed_Recycling_of_Waste_Polymer_into_RepRap_Feedstock | journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 118–125 | doi=10.1108/13552541311302978}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that using this approach of distributed recycling is better for the environment &lt;ref&gt;Kreiger, M., Anzalone, G.

The RepRap project has identified [[polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVA) as a potentially suitable support material to complement its printing process, although massive overhangs can be made with using thin layers of the primary printing media as support, which are mechanically removed afterwards.

Printing electronics is a major goal of the RepRap project so that it can print its own circuit boards. Several methods have been proposed:

* [[Wood's metal]] or [[Field's metal]]: low-melting point metal alloys to incorporate electrical circuits into the part as it is being formed.
* Silver/carbon-filled polymers: commonly used for repairs to circuit boards and are being contemplated for use for electrically conductive traces.&lt;ref name="plosone_Leight_Bradley"&gt;Simon J. Leigh, Robert J. Bradley, Christopher P. Purssell, Duncan R. Billson, David A.

* Direct extrusion of solder&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.reprap.org/2009/04/first-reprapped-circuit.html RepRap blog 2009] visited 2/26/2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conductive wires: can be laid into a part from a spool during the printing process

Using a [[Gas metal arc welding|MIG]] welder as a print head a RepRap [[deltabot]] stage can be used to print metals like [[steel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/an-inexpensive-way-to-print-out-metal-parts.html?_r=0 An Inexpensive Way to Print Out Metal Parts] - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald C.

== Construction &lt;!-- Linked from History section --&gt; ==
Although the aim of the project is for RepRap to be able to autonomously construct many of its own mechanical components in the near future using fairly low-level resources, several components such as sensors, stepper motors, or [[microcontroller]]s are currently non-replicable using the RepRap's 3D printing technology and therefore have to be produced independently of the RepRap self-replicating process. The goal is to [[asymptotically]] approach 100% replication over a series of evolutionary generations. As one example, from the onset of the project, the RepRap team has explored a variety of approaches to integrating electrically-conductive media into the product. The future success of this initiative should open the door to the inclusion of [[electrical wiring|connective wiring]], [[printed circuit board]]s, and possibly even [[Electric motor|motors]] in RepRapped products. Variations in the nature of the extruded, electrically-conductive media could produce electrical components with different functions from pure conductive traces, not unlike what was done in the sprayed-circuit process of the 1940s named Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME), described in the article on its designer, [[John Sargrove]]. [[Printed electronics]] is a related approach. Another non-replicable component is the threaded rods for the linear motions. A current research area is in using replicated [[Sarrus linkage]]s to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work = New Scientist | date = 29 May 2010 | title = I, replicator }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project members ==

The "Core team" of the project&lt;ref&gt;[http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapWiki:The_Core_Team "The Core Team - who we are"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406090137/http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapWiki%3AThe_Core_Team |date=2013-04-06 }}, reprap.org/wiki&lt;/ref&gt; has included:

* Dr Adrian Bowyer, Former Senior Lecturer, Mechanical Engineering Department, [[University of Bath]]
* [[Michael S. Hart]] (deceased 2011), creator of [[Project Gutenberg]], Illinois

== Goals ==
[[File:RepRap-printing-object.ogv|thumb|alt=Video of RepRap printing an object |Video of RepRap printing an object]]The stated goal of the RepRap project is to produce a pure self-replicating device not for its own sake, but rather to put in the hands of individuals anywhere on the planet, for a minimal outlay of capital, a [[desktop manufacturing]] system that would enable the individual to manufacture many of the artifacts used in everyday life.&lt;ref name="Jones, R. 2011"/&gt; From a theoretical viewpoint, the project is attempting to prove the hypothesis that "[[Rapid prototyping]] and direct writing technologies are sufficiently versatile to allow them to be used to make a [[von Neumann universal constructor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/idmrc/themes/projects/amps/AMPS-Project-RepRap.pdf | title=RepRap—the Replication Rapid Prototyper Project, IdMRC | accessdate=2007-02-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406095923/http://www.bath.ac.uk/idmrc/themes/projects/amps/AMPS-Project-RepRap.pdf | archivedate=2012-04-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2121">In [[Riemannian geometry]], the '''Schouten tensor''' is a second-order [[tensor]] introduced by [[Jan Arnoldus Schouten]]. It is defined for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}} by:

:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{1}{n - 2} \left(\mathrm{Ric} -\frac{ R}{2 (n-1)} g\right)\, \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{Ric}=(n-2) P + J g \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where Ric is the [[Ricci tensor]], ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], ''g'' is the [[Riemannian metric]], &lt;math&gt;J=\frac{1}{2(n-1)}R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] of ''P'' and ''n'' is the dimension of the manifold.

The [[Weyl tensor]] equals the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] minus the [[Kulkarni&amp;ndash;Nomizu product]] of the Schouten tensor with the metric. In an index notation

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ijkl}=W_{ijkl}+g_{ik} P_{jl}-g_{jk} P_{il}-g_{il} P_{jk}+g_{jl} P_{ik}\, . &lt;/math&gt;

The Schouten tensor often appears in [[conformal geometry]] because of its relatively simple conformal transformation law

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\mapsto \Omega^2 g_{ij} \Rightarrow P_{ij}\mapsto P_{ij}-\nabla_i \Upsilon_j + \Upsilon_i \Upsilon_j -\frac12 \Upsilon_k \Upsilon^k g_{ij}\, , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Upsilon_i := \Omega^{-1} \partial_i \Omega\, . &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Vietnamkrieg Bootsflüchtling 1980.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Choc images help to fight omissions]]
'''Selective omission''' is a [[memory bias]]. In [[collective memory]], it is a bias where a group (state, [[mass media|media]], [[public opinion]]) works to forget [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic memories.

This expression is often used for post-war [[historical revisionism|rewriting of history]] in a more coherent way according to local [[stereotype]]s and moral values,&lt;ref name="Penebaker 1997 79-80"&gt;Penebaker 1997 p79-81&lt;/ref&gt; which may include [[Historical negationism|denying]] war atrocities.

The viewer may forget their own side's atrocities or suggest they were done by the opposite side, while the other side's atrocities are freely exposed. On the winning side, it is closely related to the concept of fair quest and [[clean war]], which claim to kill only warriors in fights.

When remembering things from one's past, it is easier to remember events that are tied to a major life-changing event (e.g. [[flashbulb memory|flashbulb memories]]. Research done by [[Norman O. Brown|Norman Brown]], Peter Lee, and others, tested the hypothesis that [[memory]] is organized based on life-changing events by having participants recall memories with historically defined autobiographical periods (H-DAPs; i.e. "during the war", "after the earthquake"). The results found that participants that lived in war zones or places where a [[natural disaster]] such as a [[tsunami]] had occurred typically would refer to their H-DAPs to date personal events, while [[New York City|New York]]ers almost never mentioned the attacks of [[9/11]].  The researchers believed this was happening because even though they remembered the attacks of 9/11, they had very little direct effect on their everyday lives. They concluded that people use historical events to date their memories; however, what events they use and how they choose to use them remains to be determined.

In March 2010, while still a pastor, he founded aHomeinHaiti.org as a subsidiary of Courageous Church and used [[eBay]] and [[Twitter]] to raise $1.5&amp;nbsp;million to send tents to Haiti after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

==Personal life==

===High school assault===
One of his experiences in high school was what he considered a [[hate crime]] assault.&lt;ref name="FRB"/&gt; King stated a "dozen rednecks" had beaten him and the injuries caused him to miss a portion of two years of high school due to multiple spinal surgeries.&lt;ref name="RBL"/&gt; A band teacher, two fellow students from King's high school, as well as King's wife, posted their recollection of the event to [[Facebook]], backing King's account.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Activist Shaun King Denies Claims He Lied About Race and Assault |first= Ashley| last= Southall |date=August 19, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/us/activist-shaun-king-denies-claims-he-lied-about-race-and-assault.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vox 2015-08-19"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vox.com/2015/8/19/9180389/the-shaun-king-controversy-explained| publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]| first= German| last= Lopez|date=August 21, 2015|title=The Shaun King controversy, explained}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/black-lives-matter-activist-shaun-king-white-article-1.2330658|title=Rachel Dolezal 2.0?

The detective who investigated the case in 1995 described King's injuries as "minor". The associated police report noted that the incident revolved around a fight involving only one other student who defended his girlfriend after being allegedly threatened by King. The report did not indicate the incident was racially motivated. There is no mention of a "hate crime" either with local police or with the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/21/leading-ferguson-activists-hate-crime-claim-disputed-by-police-report-detective|title=Ferguson Activist's Hate Crime Claim Disputed By Police|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|last=Ross|first=Chuck|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Broughton, the investigating detective, said he interviewed six witnesses put forth by the school's principal, including a teacher who broke up the fight. All of them described it as a one-on-one altercation.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Questions regarding race===
In August 2015, [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] questioned King's biracial identity in an article for [[Breitbart News]]. Yiannopoulos reported that King's birth certificate lists Naomi Fleming and Jeffrey Wayne King (both of whom are white) as King's parents&lt;ref name=TWP&gt;{{cite web |title=Activist Shaun King says man on his birth certificate isn't his biological father |date=August 20, 2015|last1= Lowery| first1= Wesley| last2= Miller| first2= Michael |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/08/20/activist-shaun-king-says-man-on-birth-certificate-isnt-his-biological-father/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a police report cited King's race as "white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/shaun-king-interview-breitbart-black-lives-matter|title=Shaun King Speaks Out Against Breitbart's Racial Allegations|work=[[GQ]]|author=Sharlet, Jeff|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King said that the man listed on his birth certificate is his adoptive, not biological father, and that his mother has told him his biological father is a light-skinned black man.&lt;ref name=DKosRaceKing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/08/20/1413881/-Race-love-hate-and-me-A-distinctly-American-story|title=Race, love, hate, and me: A distinctly American story| last= King| first= Shaun| publisher= [[Daily Kos]]|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In various interviews with King's family and classmates conducted by the mainstream media, they stated that they understood King to be biracial growing up.&lt;ref name="CNN20150820"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=IJR/&gt;	 	
 	
After being contacted by reporters, the police officer who listed King's race as "white" was interviewed by the [[Independent Journal Review]] following Yiannopoulos's article for Breitbart. The officer recalled the case and stated that he believed King to be biracial, and that everyone who knew King presumed he was mixed. He went on to state that he had only listed King as white because he is light-skinned, and biracial was not an option on his form.&lt;ref name=IJR/&gt; King and his supporters expressed concern that such questions were an attempt to distract from the Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;ref name="CNN20150820"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/us/shaun-king-controversy|title=Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King addresses race reports|author=Cris, Doug|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rogers, Katie|title=In Questions Over Shaun King's Race, Activists See Challenge to Black Lives Matter Movement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/in-questions-over-shaun-kings-race-activists-see-challenge-to-black-lives-matter-movement.html?_r=0|accessdate=September 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Overview==
===Technical Concept===
Restore [[Nature]] in a Natural way is the technical concept of ''Simulate Loam Substrate'', and this technology is applied to form the ideal [[soil structure]], select suitable plant species to ensure the proportion of [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s in the later plant communities, &lt;ref name="National Intellectual Property Administration"&gt;[http://epub.sipo.gov.cn/tdcdesc.action?strWhere=CN107251729A 2017103443306 A Simulate Loam Substrate spray-casting construction method for slope].''[[National Intellectual Property Administration]]''.Retrieved 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;so as to restore [[Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lvyan.cn/about/?192.html Simulate Loam Substrate：Mine geological environment recovery technology].''lvyan.cn''.(in Chinese and English).Retrieved 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="China Land and Resources News"&gt;[http://zgdzzhyfz.paperopen.com/oa/darticle.aspx?type=view&amp;id=180123 类壤土基质技術及其在礦山環境恢復治理中的若干應用].''China Land and Resources News''.(in Chinese and English).Retrieved 25 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ZGDH201801022.htm Simulate Loam Substrate类壤土基质及相關應用].''[[China National Knowledge Infrastructure]]''.Retrieved 22 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Technical principle===
As the ecological environment green governance technology, the core of ''Simulate Loam Substrate'' is to combine the engineering, botany, soil science and other disciplines to simulate the loam matrix structure suitable for plant growth through [[biomimetic technology]], which is beneficial to plant seeds, root development, microbial activity and nutrient transformation.&lt;ref name="National Intellectual Property Administration"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.cqu.edu.cn/asset/detail.aspx?id=203282775542 类壤土基质：一種新型生態環境綠色治理技術].''[[Chongqing University]]''.Retrieved 9 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The right to a '''speedy trial''' is a [[human right]] under which it is asserted that a government prosecutor may not delay the trial of a criminal suspect arbitrarily and indefinitely. Otherwise, the power to impose such delays would effectively allow prosecutors to send anyone to jail for an arbitrary length of time without trial.

Although it is important for the protection of speedy trial rights that there be a court in which a defendant may complain about the unreasonable delay of the trial, it is also important that nations implement structures that avoid the delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Equa durata del processo: il risarcimento non risolve il problema |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89306900}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of speedy trial rights==
In jurisdictions with strong [[rule of law]], the requirement of a "speedy trial" forces prosecutors to diligently build cases within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity and heinousness of the crimes of which suspects are accused. The right is based on the notion that long-term incarceration should normally be restricted to situations in which a judge or jury have determined a suspect has committed a crime.

The right to a speedy trial is codified in fundamental legal documents in several jurisdictions, and may be further defined by statutory law.

===Canada===
Speedy trial rights are recognized within [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

===Europe===

Within Europe, speedy trial rights are recognized by [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

In English law, this right was developed by the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 (a judge would be summoned if one was not immediately available) and [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 ("To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shestokas|first1=David J.|title=Sixth Amendment’s Speedy Trial Right: Ancient, Worthy and Elusive|url=http://www.shestokas.com/constitution-educational-series/sixth-amendments-speedy-trial-right-ancient-worthy-and-elusive/|website=David Shestokas|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states, "All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]], or administrative bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Philippines, Article III|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Philippines_(1987)#Article_III:_Bill_of_Rights|website=Wikisource|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, basic speedy trial rights are protected by the [[Speedy Trial Clause]] of the United States Constitution. States may also offer additional speedy trial protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are Speedy Trial Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-speedy-trial-rights|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1776, a "speedy trial" provision was explicitly included in the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] by [[George Mason]], its principal author.

The consequences of a speedy trial violation may require that the case be dismissed, although depending upon the circumstances it may be possible for the state to again initiate a criminal charge against a defendant despite a speedy trial violation.

The '''Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE)''' is a [[compiler]] for a domain-specific language that allows chemists to specify the computation in a high-level [[Wolfram Mathematica|Mathematica]]-style language. It transforms [[tensor]] summation expressions to low-level code (C/Fortran) for specific hardware being mindful of [[Computer memory|memory]] availability, communication costs, [[loop fusion]] and ordering, etc. It is used primarily in [[computational chemistry]].

'''The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees''' ('''Lexington Principles''') is a body of international '''[[due process]]''' principles that reflect the prevailing transnational norms in the area of detainee treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples |title=The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees :: The Lexington Principles Project :: W&amp;L Law School |publisher=Law.wlu.edu |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Lexington Principles''' were completed and published on April 1, 2009. The instrument consists of 45 principles and countless annotations prepared by the project's law student editorial board. A primary purpose of the drafters of the Lexington Principles was to assist the jurisprudential evolution of American constitutional due process standards after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''. While each Principle is based on '''[[international law]]''', all provisions have been drafted to facilitate vertical norm internalization into the domestic legal system of the '''[[United States]]''' and other '''[[common law]]''' countries.

==History==

===Mission of the Lexington Principles Project===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The mission of the Lexington Principles Project is to engage the international community to clarify and strengthen transnational norms pertaining to due process of law and the treatment of persons detained on suspicion of terrorist activities, and to foster a common approach to these matters, in keeping with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission on this subject.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lexington Principles Website, Mission Statement|url=http://law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples/page.asp?pageid=760|publisher=Law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 9/11 Commission===
{{main|9/11 Commission}}
On July 22, 2004, the '''[[9/11 Commission]]''' issued its [[9/11 Commission Report|report]] on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In this report, the Commission made numerous recommendations to U.S. government officials on how to better defend the United States against the spread of [[international terrorism]]. In reference to detainee treatment standards, the Commission recommended that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"(t)he United States should engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. New principles might draw upon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions on the law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed for those cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum standards are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international law.".&lt;ref&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Ch 12 p 380&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[White House]] responded to the 9-11 Commission's recommendation with the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The United States has worked closely with its coalition partners regarding the detention and treatment of captured terrorists, and is open to exploring whether a "common coalition approach" is feasible and consistent with our national security.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Press Release, Bush Administration Actions Consistent with 9/11 Recommendations|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/20040730-18.html|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seventeen months later the 9/11 Commission met again to grade the government's progress on implementing each of the 41 recommendations detailed in its Report. The Commission gave an "F" to the Commission's recommendation regarding "Coalition Standards for Terrorist Detention.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, 1-Page Grade Sheet|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-12-05_summary.pdf|publisher=9-11pdp.org|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain its issuance of a failing grade with respect to the government's compliance with this recommendation, the Commission stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The U.S. has not engaged in a common coalition approach to developing standards for detention and prosecution of captured terrorists. Indeed, U.S. treatment of detainees has elicited broad criticism, and makes it harder to build the necessary alliances to cooperate effectively with partners in a global war on terror.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, Page 7|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-12-05_report.pdf|publisher=9-11pdp.org|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Washington and Lee University===
Several professors and alumni at '''[[Washington and Lee University]]''' sought to assist the process of implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation by initiating a scholarly dialogue between military practitioners and legal experts aimed at identifying the high end of prevailing transnational norms pertaining to detainee treatment. They created '''The Lexington Principles Project''' and began the lengthy process of research and analysis that culminated in the publication of the '''Draft Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees''' on September 25, 2008. These draft principles were approved and published in final form on April 1, 2009 along with student-edited annotations.

==Methodology==

===Codifying the Gold Standard in Transnational Detainee Treatment Standards===
The Lexington Principles Project's participants did not want simply to restate existing international norms. Many groups had already aptly performed that function and such an effort would have been redundant, and possibly even counterproductive to developing a universal approach to detainee treatment. The Lexington Principles Project therefore aimed to develop a progressive set of principles recognizing the highest standards set forth in international law and the domestic legal systems of foreign nations.

===Transnational Legal Process Approach===
To overcome the difficulties inherent in applying international law in domestic courts, the Lexington Principles Project structured its efforts in accordance with the theory of [[Transnational Legal Process]] developed by '''[[Harold Hongju Koh]]''', the Dean of '''[[Yale Law School]]'''. The Project's use of this approach was facilitated by the availability of the considerable transnational law resources of the '''[[Transnational Law Institute]]''' at '''[[Washington and Lee University School of Law]]'''.

===Due Process Paradigm===
The Transnational Legal Process approach required the group to focus on vertical process throughout all stages of norm definition. The result was the creation of an innovative conceptual framework based on the familiar common law due process paradigm. Accordingly, the bulk of detainee rights under international law are categorized into one of three groups:

# General Provisions
# Procedural Due Process
# Substantive Due Process

===Normative Translation===
The term "due process" is unique to common law legal systems, and is not generally found in the text of international human rights and humanitarian law treaties. Due process is a powerful concept at common law, so it was important for the Lexington Principles to be phrased in those terms. All of the transnational norms discovered during the lengthy research phase of the Lexington Principles Project needed to be translated into aspects of due process. This was accomplished by distilling all points of mutuality in the law governing detainee treatment under both international law and domestic U.S. law down to one central right: the right to physical liberty. Principle 1 of the Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees codified this right, and all other rights were drafted as essentially derivative of this central guarantee. 

'''Principle 1''' states, "Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principle 1, The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (Draft Principles, September 25, 2008)|url=http://law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples/page.asp?pageid=769|publisher=Law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transnational Incorporation Doctrine===
The '''[[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Transnational Incorporation Doctrine]]''', first developed for the Lexington Principles, asserts that there are some principles of international law that are so fundamental to accepted global standards of justice that they should be implied as part the right to '''[[due process of law]]''' under the '''[[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]'''. This is a new progressive theory that has yet to be adopted by the '''[[United States Supreme Court]]'''. The theory was constructed by the professors drafting the Lexington Principles as a means of offering modern judges a jurisprudential concept that could afford them the opportunity to recognize a host of modern human rights that have developed in legal systems around the world since the American Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. This conceptual mechanism for transnational norm internalization, if adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, would give progressive American judges the opportunity to protect individual liberty by incorporating into the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause a variety of new and emerging human rights protections that pertain to modern American life in the Information Age. Liberty rights associated with privacy and personal autonomy in cyberspace were inconceivable in 1791 during the drafting of the original Bill of Rights. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would provide a way for courts to modernize the rights all American citizens enjoy vis-a-vis their government without the need to amend the Constitution through the cumbersome process prescribed in Article V. The formal amendment process makes meaningful change practically impossible to achieve, which is why the Lexington Principles Project crafted this new mechanism to facilitate bringing Americans rights up to the highest transnational standards.

===Moving Beyond Nationality and Territoriality===
A significant ancillary consequence of the novel and still unadopted Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would be its effect on the rights afforded to non-United States persons under U.S. law. Presently, United States citizens and permanent residents are afforded full protection under the United States Constitution both at home and abroad, with limited exceptions. Persons who are not American citizens or permanent residents are afforded no protection under the U.S. Constitution outside of U.S. borders and substantially diminished rights while on U.S. soil. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, if adopted, would change the American understanding of Constitutional rights making them "human" rights rather than rights tied to nationality or territorial location. 

Support for this result comes from the emerging transnational trend toward '''[[universal jurisdiction|universality]]''' of [[international human rights law]]. Because international human rights are universal, the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine's new interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's '''[[Due Process Clause]]''' could result in universal application of all incorporated rights regardless of nationality or physical location. With respect to these newly domesticated transnational rights, former barriers to rights recognition based on [[nationality]] and [[territoriality]] would no longer affect applicability. Any rights incorporated through the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would likely have to be universally afforded to all human beings by the '''[[U.S. government]]'''. 

These new transnational rights likely would not be nearly as extensive as those offered to U.S. citizens in the United States, but at a minimum they would ensure that the most fundamental due process rights are always afforded in all instances where a human being is detained by the U.S. government for any reason anywhere in the world.

==The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (April 1, 2009)==
[[File:The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees.pdf|thumb|The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees]]

===I. Part I: General Provisions===

====A. Section A: Fundamental Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law====

=====1. Principle 1: Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law=====
Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.

====B. Section B: Scope of Application====

=====2. Principle 2: General Statement of Universal Applicability=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and apply in all situations where a person has been detained by a State or its agents regardless of the reasons for, or circumstances surrounding, the detention.

=====3. Principle 3: Irrelevance of Geography=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to the location of capture or detention.

=====4. Principle 4: Nondiscrimination=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any other such criteria.

====C. Section C: State Responsibility====

=====5. Principle 5: General Statement of State Responsibility to Protect=====
Each State has the responsibility to protect the right to physical liberty for all persons within its territory or otherwise under its control except insofar as they are properly detained in accordance with Principle 1.

=====6. Principle 6: Commencement of State Responsibility to Protect=====
At a minimum, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person begins at the moment the person is detained by its agents.

=====7. Principle 7: Duration of State Responsibility to Protect=====
Once initiated, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person continues until that individuals physical liberty is ultimately restored.

=====8. Principle 8: State Responsibility to Protect upon Transfer=====
Transfer of a Person to the custody of another State does not terminate the transferring States responsibility to protect the rights of the transferee. The transferring State should maintain an active interest in the rights of the transferee and seek periodic assurances that due process rights are continuously afforded until the transferees physical liberty is ultimately restored.

====D. Section D: International Obligation====

=====9. Principle 9: Statement of Universal Concern=====
A State's compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of persons it deprives of physical liberty is a concern of humankind and therefore should be of interest to all members of the international community.

====E. Section E: Relationship to Other Laws====

=====10. Principle 10: Rules of Construction=====
These Principles should not be construed to diminish any human right or protection afforded by any other source of law.

===II. Part II: Procedural Due Process===

====A. Section A: General Statement of Procedural Rights====

=====11. Principle 11: Right to Procedural Due Process=====
Procedural due process is a human right requiring that all persons be afforded notice of, and an opportunity to challenge, any State action substantially affecting their fundamental right to physical liberty in a fair and public hearing before an impartial adjudicator with the independent authority to remedy violations through direct action and without undue restrictions.

=====12. Principle 12: Prohibition of Extralegal Arrest and Detention=====
Due process requires that no deprivation of liberty occur outside of a legal process designed and equipped to assess the legality of the deprivation before, after, and during the period of detention.

=====13. Principle 13: Prohibition of Extralegal Rendition=====
No State should subject any person to nonconsensual transfer from one national jurisdiction to another unless such transfer is performed pursuant to judicial process.

====B. Section B: Notice====

=====14. Principle 14: Notice of Reasons for Deprivation and Procedural Rights=====
When a State substantially impairs the right to physical liberty of any person it should provide that person with effective written notice of the reasons for the impairment and the procedural mechanisms through which the person may challenge the deprivation.

=====15. Principle 15: Sufficiency of Notice=====
The required notice should be sufficient to inform the person of the laws authorizing the impairment and the nature of the evidence justifying its use in the specific case, described with sufficient particularity to allow the person to evaluate the factual and legal basis for the deprivation. If full disclosure of the evidence underlying the factual basis for the detention would result in a substantial risk of harm to individuals or national security, the detainee may be informed of the general nature of the States justification for the detention sufficient to allow the detainee to communicate relevant information to the detaining authorities which might assist them in determining whether continued detention is justified.

====C. Section C: Opportunity to be Heard====

=====16. Principle 16: Right to Challenge Substantial Deprivations=====
All persons should have the right to challenge any substantial State deprivations of their right to physical liberty before a fair and impartial decision maker with the authority to remedy undue infringements without unnecessary delay.

=====17. Principle 17: Right to Presumption of Innocence in Criminal Hearings=====
All persons charged with a criminal offense should be presumed innocent until proven guilty through an adjudicative process conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process.

=====18. Principle 18: Right to Participate in Legal Process=====
All persons should be afforded the opportunity to participate in legal proceedings adjudicating matters directly affecting their right to physical liberty.

=====19. Principle 19: Right to Counsel=====
All persons should be afforded the opportunity to consult legal counsel before and during legal proceedings adjudicating matters pertaining to substantial deprivations of their right to physical liberty.

====D. Section D: Fair and Impartial Decision Maker====

=====20. Principle 20: Composition of Adjudicative Mechanism=====
Decision makers charged with adjudicating matters affecting a person's fundamental rights should be impartial and adequately educated to properly perform that function.

=====21. Principle 21: Right of Adjudicators to Report Suspected Abuses=====
Adjudicators should have the means to report their concerns regarding suspected rights violations to appropriate authorities outside of the control of the governmental entity suspected of committing the violations.

===III. Part III: Substantive Due Process===

====A. Section A: General Statement of Substantive Rights====

=====22. Principle 22: Right to Substantive Due Process=====
Implicit in the fundamental right to due process of law is the requirement that no State should deprive any person of life, liberty, or security of person in violation of any right fundamental to accepted principles of global justice.

====B. Section B: Prohibition of Arbitrary Deprivations of Physical Liberty====

=====23. Principle 23: Prohibition of Arbitrary Arrest and Detention=====
No State should arrest or detain any person for reasons that are arbitrary. An arrest or detention is arbitrary if it is not performed pursuant to law or if it is incompatible with the fundamental principles of global justice.

=====24. Principle 24: Right to the Rule of Law=====
No person should be deprived of the right to physical liberty except pursuant to the rule of law. State actors should never deprive any person of physical liberty except pursuant to specific and demonstrable legal authority governed by written laws and procedures.

=====25. Principle 25: Prohibition of Detention Based on the Exercise of Fundamental Rights=====
No State should detain any person based solely on that persons exercise of a fundamental human right.

=====26. Principle 26: Prohibition of Detention Based on Discriminatory Animus=====
No State should detain any person based solely on that persons nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any similar criteria.

=====27. Principle 27: Prohibition of Ex Post Facto Application of Penal Law=====
No State should try any person for a penal offense based on acts or omissions which did not constitute a penal offense at the time they were committed.

=====28. Principle 28: Prohibition of Double Jeopardy=====
No State should detain, try, or punish any person for an offence for which the person has already been finally convicted or acquitted.

=====29. Principle 29: Prohibition of Deprivations Based on the Actions of Third Parties=====
No State should deprive any person of liberty based solely on the alleged or actual wrongdoing of a third party.

=====30. Principle 30: Prohibition of Indefinite Non-Punitive Detention=====
Extrajudicial detention beyond the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective is inconsistent with the principles of due process. No State should detain any person outside the judicial process unless such detention is conducted in accordance with substantial procedural safeguards narrowly tailored to ensure the detention is strictly limited to the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective.

=====31. Principle 31: Right to Repatriation Following Detention=====
All persons should be afforded the right to return to their country of nationality or citizenship upon the cessation of detention by a foreign State.

====C. Section C: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention====

=====32. Principle 32: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention=====
Prolonged incommunicado detention is incompatible with the substantive liberty guarantees inherent in the fundamental right to due process of law.

=====33. Principle 33: Right to Communicate with Relatives=====
Persons subjected to prolonged detention should be allowed to communicate with their family at regular intervals, subject to the supervision of the detaining authorities, unless the State demonstrates that the denial of such communication is necessary based on a demonstrable risk to national security or the safety of any person.

=====34. Principle 34: Right to Communicate with Diplomatic or Consular Representatives=====
All persons deprived of their liberty by the government of a foreign State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic or consular representatives of their home State as soon as practicable after the deprivation and periodically throughout the period of detention as needed to ensure they are afforded the full benefits of the protections guaranteed to foreign nationals under international law.

All persons who are refugees, stateless persons, or nationals of States without diplomatic or consular representation in the detaining State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic and consular representatives of the State which takes charge of their interests or any national or international authority whose task it is to protect such persons.

=====35. Principle 35: Right to Unmonitored Communication with Physicians=====
All persons subjected to prolonged deprivations of liberty should be afforded the right to periodic unmonitored communications with the physicians charged with providing their medical care in order to allow the disclosure of allegations of abuse by the detaining authorities.

=====36. Principle 36: Right of Physicians to Report Suspected Rights Violations=====
Physicians charged with providing medical care for persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded a mechanism for disclosure of suspected detainee abuse to an authority outside the control of the entity committing the abuse, under conditions affording the physician adequate protection against retribution.

=====37. Principle 37: Right to Information about the Outside World=====
All persons deprived of their liberty for an extended time should be given regular access to periodicals, books, educational materials, audio programs, writing materials, and other such items intended to keep them mentally engaged, informed of world events, and to allow them to make productive use of their time while in detention.

=====38. Principle 38: Right of Public Access to Facility Procedures=====
A detaining State should make the general procedures governing the operation of its detention facilities available to the public. Sensitive security information may be exempted from public disclosure, although such procedures should be subject to review through an independent mechanism within the detaining government.

=====39. Principle 39: Rights of Relief Organizations to Inspect Prisoners and Facilities=====
No State should unduly restrict the ability of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other appropriate relief organizations to inspect detention facilities and to engage in unmonitored communication with individual detainees for the purpose of monitoring the States compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of detainees under its control.

====D. Section D: Prohibition of Offenses to Personal Welfare and Human Dignity====

=====40. Principle 40: Prohibition of Grave Breaches=====
No State should subject any person to torture, cruel treatment, biological experiments, murder, mutilation, maiming, rape, sexual abuse, or the intentional infliction of serious bodily or psychological injury.

=====41. Principle 41: Prohibition of Extra-Legal Interrogation Methods=====
No State should interrogate any person employing methods that have not been approved for use by law.

=====42. Principle 42: Duty to Maintain Records of Physical Interrogations=====
A State employing physical interrogation methods on any person should be required to maintain records detailing the specific dates, times, and duration of each physical interrogation session and specifying all of the physical methods employed together with the written legal authorization approving their use. Such records should be maintained for a period of fifty years, and destruction of such records should be a criminal offense.

=====43. Principle 43: Right of Access to Records of Physical Interrogations=====
All persons subjected to physical interrogation methods by a State should be given full access to the records pertaining to such interrogations.

=====44. Principle 44: Right to Adequate Healthcare, Nutrition, and Exercise=====
All persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded adequate healthcare, nutrition, and opportunities for physical exercise necessary for the maintenance of both physical and mental fitness during the period of detention.

=====45. Principle 45: Right to Religious Observance=====
All persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded reasonable accommodations necessary to permit religious observance in accordance with the tenets of their faith or dictates of their conscience.

The '''turning radius''' or '''turning circle''' of a [[vehicle]] is the radius (or, depending on usage, ''diameter'') of the smallest [[circle|circular]] turn (i.e. [[U-turn (maneuver)|U-turn]]) that the vehicle is capable of making. 
[[File:Swept path analysis.jpg|thumb|Turning radius of a vehicle depends on the vehicle type]]

==Usage==
The term ''turning radius'' is a technical term that has become popular automotive jargon. In the jargon sense, it is commonly used to mean the full diameter of the smallest circle, but in technical usage the turning radius is still used to denote the radius. The less ambiguous term ''turning circle'' avoids the mistaken jargon use of the word 'radius' . As an example, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' refers to a ''curb-to-curb turning circle'' of a 2008 Cadillac CTS as {{convert|35.5|ft|m|2}}, but the terminology is not yet settled. AutoChannel.com refers to the ''turning radius'' of the same car as {{convert|35.5|ft|m|2}}. It is often used as a [[generalization|generalized]] term rather than a [[number|numerical figure]]. For example, a vehicle with a very small turning circle may be described as having a "tight turning radius".

==Curb to curb==
Two different measurements can be quoted for a vehicle. A '''curb''' or '''curb-to-curb''' turning circle will show the straight-line distance from one side of the circle to the other, through the center.  The name "curb-to-curb" indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a u-turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel. If you took the street curb and built it higher, as high as the car, and tried to make a u-turn in the street, parts of the car (bumper) would hit the wall. The name '''wall''' or '''wall-to-wall''' turning circle denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a u-turn without scraping the walls.  One can find these two ways of measuring the turning circle used in auto specifications, for example, a van might be listed as having a turning circle (in meters) of 12.1(C)/12.4(W).

A notable exception in this description is of vehicles that are capable of [[Rotation|spinning]] around their central axis, such as certain [[Lawn mower#Riding_mowers|lawnmowers]] and [[Motorized wheelchair|wheelchair]]s as they do not follow a circular path as they turn. In this case the vehicle is referred to as a "[[0 (number)|zero]] turning radius" vehicle.

Some [[camera dolly|camera dollies]] used in the [[film industry]] have a "round" mode which allows them to spin around their [[Z axis#In three dimensions|z axis]] by allowing [[Synchronization|synchronized]] inverse rotation of their front and rear wheel sets, effectively giving them "zero" turning radius.

In mathematics applied to the study of networks, the '''Wiener connector''', named in honor of chemist [[Harry Wiener]] who first introduced the [[Wiener Index]], is a means of maximizing efficiency in connecting specified "query vertices" in a network. Given a [[connected graph|connected]], [[undirected graph]] and a set of query vertices in a graph, the '''minimum Wiener connector''' is an [[induced subgraph]] that connects the query vertices and minimizes the sum of [[shortest path]] distances among all pairs of vertices in the subgraph. In [[combinatorial optimization]], the '''minimum Wiener connector problem''' is the problem of finding the minimum Wiener connector. It can be thought of as a version of the classic [[Steiner tree problem]] (one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]), where instead of minimizing the size of the tree, the objective is to minimize the distances in the subgraph.&lt;ref name="steiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Frank|last2=Richards|first2=Dana|last3=Winter|first3=Dana|last4=Winter|first4=Pawel|title=The Steiner Tree Problem|journal=Annals of Discrete Mathematics|date=1992|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/01675060/53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dimacs"&gt;[http://dimacs11.cs.princeton.edu/ DIMACS Steiner Tree Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum Wiener connector was first presented by Ruchansky, et al. in 2015.&lt;ref name="sigmod"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bonchi|first2=Francesco|last3=Garcia-Soriano|first3=David|last4=Gullo|first4=Francesco|last5=Kourtellis|first5=Nicolas|date=2015|year=|title=The Minimum Wiener Connector|arxiv=1504.00513|journal=SIGMOD|volume=|pages=|via=|last1=Ruchansky|first1=Natali|bibcode=2015arXiv150400513R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum Wiener connector has applications in many domains where there is a graph structure and an interest in learning about connections between sets of individuals. For example, given a set of patients infected with a viral disease, which other patients should be checked to find the culprit? Or given a set of proteins of interest, which other proteins participate in pathways with them?

==Problem definition==
The [[Wiener index]] is the sum of shortest path distances in a (sub)graph. Using &lt;math&gt;d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the shortest path between &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the Wiener index of a (sub)graph &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;W(S)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;W(S) = \sum_{(u, v) \in S} d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

The minimum Wiener connector problem is defined as follows. Given an undirected and unweighted graph with vertex set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and a set of query vertices &lt;math&gt;Q\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, find a connector &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; of minimum Wiener index. More formally, the problem is to compute
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname*{arg\,min}_H W(H\cup Q)&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, find a connector &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the sum of shortest paths in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relationship to Steiner tree==
[[File:SteinerExample nicer.pdf|thumb|upright=2.0|The optimal solutions to the Steiner tree problem and the minimum Wiener connector can differ. Define the set of query vertices ''Q'' by ''Q'' = {''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}. The unique optimal solution to the Steiner tree problem is ''Q'' itself, which has Wiener index 165, whereas the optimal solution for the minimum Wiener connector problem is ''Q'' ∪ {''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, which has Wiener index 142.]]
The minimum Wiener connector problem is related to the [[Steiner tree problem]]. In the former, the [[objective function]] in the minimization is the Wiener index of the connector, whereas in the latter, the objective function is the sum of the weights of the edges in the connector. The optimum solutions to these problems may differ, given the same graph and set of query vertices. In fact, a solution for the Steiner tree problem may be arbitrarily bad for the minimum Wiener connector problem; the graph on the right provides an example.

== Computational complexity ==

===Hardness===
The problem is [[NP-hard]], and does not admit a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] unless [[P = NP|'''P''' = '''NP''']].&lt;ref name="sigmod"/&gt; This can be proven using the [[inapproximability]] of [[vertex cover]] in bounded degree graphs.&lt;ref name="dinursafra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinur|first1=Irit|last2=Safra|first2=Samuel|title=On the hardness of approximating minimum vertex cover|journal=Annals of Mathematics|date=2005|doi=10.4007/annals.2005.162.439|volume=162|pages=439–485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme, there is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation—an algorithm that finds a connector whose Wiener index is within a constant multiplicative factor of the Wiener index of the optimum connector. In terms of [[complexity class]]es, the minimum Wiener connector problem is in '''[[APX]]''' but is not in '''PTAS''' unless '''P''' = '''NP'''.

=== Exact algorithms ===
An exhaustive search over all possible subsets of vertices to find the one that induces the connector of minimum Wiener index yields an algorithm that finds the optimum solution in &lt;math&gt;2^{O(n)}&lt;/math&gt; time (that is, [[exponential time]]) on graphs with ''n'' vertices. In the special case that there are exactly two query vertices, the optimum solution is the [[shortest path]] joining the two vertices, so the problem can be solved in [[polynomial time]] by computing the shortest path. In fact, for any fixed constant number of query vertices, an optimum solution can be found in polynomial time.

=== Approximation algorithms ===
There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum Wiener connector problem that runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(q (m \log n + n \log^2 n))&lt;/math&gt; on a graph with ''n'' vertices, ''m'' edges, and ''q'' query vertices, roughly the same time it takes to compute shortest-path distances from the query vertices to every other vertex in the graph.&lt;ref name="sigmod"/&gt; The central approach of this algorithm is to reduce the problem to the vertex-weighted Steiner tree problem, which admits a constant-factor approximation in particular instances related to the minimum Wiener connector problem.

==Behavior==

The minimum Wiener connector behaves like [[Centrality#Betweenness centrality|betweenness centrality]].

When the query vertices belong to the same community, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector tend to belong to the same community and have high centrality within the community.  Such vertices are likely to be influential vertices playing leadership roles in the community. In a [[social network]], these influential vertices might be good users for spreading information or to target in a viral marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="viral"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Oliver | last1=Hinz | first2=Bernd | last2=Skiera | first3=Christian | last3=Barrot | first4=Jan U. | last4=Becker | title=Seeding Strategies for Viral Marketing: An Empirical Comparison | journal=Journal of Marketing | volume=75 | number=6 | pages=55–71 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1509/jm.10.0088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the query vertices belong to different communities, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector contain vertices adjacent to edges that bridge the different communities. These vertices span a [[Social Network#Structural holes|structural hole]] in the graph and are important.&lt;ref name="structhole"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Lou|first1=Tiancheng|last2=Tang|first2=Jie|title=Mining Structural Hole Spanners Through Information Diffusion in Social Networks|booktitle=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web|date=2013|isbn=9781450320351|location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|pages=825–836|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488388.2488461|publisher=International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The minimum Wiener connector is useful in applications in which one wishes to learn about the relationship between a set of vertices in a graph. For example,
* in [[biology]], it provides insight into how a set of proteins in a [[protein–protein interaction]] network are related,
* in [[social network]]s (like [[Twitter]]), it demonstrates the communities to which a set of users belong and how these communities are related,
* in [[computer network]]s, it may be useful in identifying an efficient way to route a [[multicast]] message to a set of destinations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6864">'''Wonderbag''' is a stand-alone, non-electric insulated bag designed to reduce the amount of [[fuel]] required in the [[cooking]] of food in [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt; Instead of being placed on a [[stove]] for the duration of the cooking period, food is instead heated to a hot enough temperature then transferred to the Wonderbag, which uses the principle of [[thermal insulation]] to continue cooking, and keeps food warm without needing additional fire or heat.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;  Working on the principle of [[thermal cooking]], the Wonderbag is estimated to save up to 30% of the total fuel costs associated with cooking with [[Kerosene]] ("paraffin") alone. In developing countries there are numerous advantages for the product, as it immediately helps ease [[deforestation]] of natural reserves, and it frees up those who would spend their time gathering the extra wood for fire fuel.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

Designed by [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]-based entrepreneur Sarah Collins of Natural Balance, and [[poverty]] activist Moshy Mathe, the Wonderbag is aimed at societies where fuel is expensive or time-consuming to gather.

As of January 2012, over 150,000 Wonderbags were in use in South Africa, with the manufacturers and partners such as [[Unilever]] intending to promote the use of the device worldwide.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; {{As of|January 2013}} over 650,000 have been distributed in "South Africa, [[Rwanda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Syria]]n refugee camps in [[Jordan]]."&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

== History ==
Sarah Collins developed the idea for the Wonderbag during power outages in South Africa in 2008.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

Anna Pearce describes in her book "Simply Living - The Story of the Compassion and the Wonderbox" from 1989 how the old idea of the hayboxes turned into polystyrene filled cushions - The Wonderbox - to cook in South Africa ({{ISBN|1 85421 048 3}}) Wonderboxes were also distributed beginning as early as 1976, while not a new invention, the wonderbag is an innovative take on an old design.

The original Wonderbox was designed and produced by Shirley Buys (nee' Woodbridge) in Durban in 1976, based upon the Hay Box design used in her childhood in war-time England. Shirley trained as a patternmaker and designed the inverted oversized 'beanbag' containing recycled polystyrene chips in a polyester-cotton fabric bag and lid within a corrugated cardboard box and personally marketed it across Zululand between 1976 and 1980. Compassion of South Africa, a non-sectarian Christian action group opposing Apartheid, and the particular assistance from Brigid Oppenheimer facilitated Shirley's design and marketing and published a comprehensive recipe book &lt;ref&gt;https://thermalcooker.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/wonder-box-recipe-booklet/&lt;/ref&gt;with a lot of graphics to help illiterate users follow the recipes.&lt;ref&gt;http://foodstorageandsurvival.com/building-a-wonderbox-style-insulated-cooking-box&lt;/ref&gt; The design was deliberately not patented and Compassion of South Africa asked to be recognised in the sharing of the recipe book.  Shirley manufactured the Wonderbox in her workshop in her Morningside Durban home for over 3 years before Compassion established several other manufacturing facilities across South African, and shared the design freely. 

== Design ==
The Wonderbag consists of an inner layer of insulation containing recycled [[polystyrene]] balls, with an outer, [[drawstring]]&lt;ref name="Metro" /&gt; covering of polyester-cotton blend textiles.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; The manufacturers expect that in time the polystyrene (which is non-[[Biodegradation|biodegradeable]]) will be replaced with a [[polyurethane]] blend.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Use ==
To use the Wonderbag, first a [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pot]] is heated as normal on a stove until it reaches the required cooking temperature. At this point, the pot is removed from the stove and placed in the bag, where due to the insulation the receptacle remains near the stovetop temperature for an extended period. Rice, for instance, may be cooked by heating in a pot of water for two minutes until the water boils and then placing in the Wonderbag for another hour, while for a meat dish the stovetop time is twenty minutes and the bag time five hours.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt;

== Fuel savings ==
Due to the reduction in fuel used, the Wonderbag is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to half a ton per year if used three times a week.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Retail and production ==
The Wonderbag is available in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19607">'''Work-family conflict''' occurs when an individual experiences incompatible demands between work and family roles, causing participation in both roles to become more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Beutell, N. J. (1985). Sources and conflict between work and family roles. Academy of Management Review, 10(1), 76-88.&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance creates conflict at the [[work-life interface]]. It is important for organizations and individuals to understand the implications linked to work-family conflict. In certain cases, work-family conflict has been associated with increased [[occupational burnout]], [[job stress]], decreased health, and issues pertaining to [[organizational commitment]] and [[job performance]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amstad, F. T., Meier, L. L., Fasel, U., Elfering, A., &amp; Semmer, N. K. (2011). A meta-analysis of work–family conflict and various outcomes with a special emphasis on cross-domain versus matching-domain relations. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 16(2), 151-169. doi: 10.1037/a0022170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

== Foundation ==
Work-family conflict was first studied in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lavassani &amp; Movahedi|first=Kayvan Miri &amp; Bahar|date=2014|title=DEVELOPMENTS IN THEORIES AND MEASURES OF WORK-FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS: FROM CONFLICT TO BALANCE|url=http://davidwimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kayvan-miri-lavassani-bahar-movahedi-work-family-life-6-19.pdf|journal=Contemporary Research on Organization Management and Administration|volume=2|pages=2335-7959|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, work and income moved from inside the home (agricultural work) to outside the home (factories).&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Industrialization challenged the current relationship between working and family.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Boundary theory and border theory are the foundations used to study work-family conflict.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; '''Boundary theory''' divides social life into two interdependent sections, work and family. Individuals have different roles and responsibilities in each section.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Since the sections are interdependent, two roles cannot take place at the same time.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Individuals have to participate in role transformation between expectations of the workplace and expected roles within the family structure.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

'''Border theory''' expands this by considering the influences each section has on the other.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Border theory attempts to pin down ways to manage conflict and achieve balance between conflicting identities.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Individuals may choose to treat these segments separately, moving back and forth between work and family roles (displaying boundary theory) or can decide to integrate the segments with hopes of finding balance.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==Forms of conflict==
Conflict between work and family is [[wikt:bi-directional|bi-directional]]. There is a distinction between what is termed '''work-to-family conflict''' and what is termed '''family-to-work conflict'''.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

'''Work-to-family conflict''' occurs when experiences and commitments at work interfere with family life, such as extensive, irregular, or inflexible work hours, work overload and other forms of [[job stress]], interpersonal conflict at work, extensive travel, career transitions, or an unsupportive supervisor or organization.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; For example, an unexpected meeting late in the day may prevent a parent from picking up his or her child from school.

'''Family-to-work conflict''' occurs when experiences and commitments in the family interfere with work life, such as the presence of young children, primary responsibility for children, elder care responsibilities, interpersonal conflict within the family unit, or unsupportive family members.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;For example, a parent may need to take time off from work in order to take care of a sick child, or to witness a tournament or performance of a child. Family-to-work conflict is perceived to result in lower work productivity of employees.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Within work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, three subtypes of conflict have been identified: time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based. ''Time-based'' conflict entails competing time requirements across work and family roles, ''strain-based'' conflict entails pressures in one role impairing performance in the second role, and ''behavior-based'' conflict entails an incompatibility of behaviors necessary for the two roles. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Powell, G. N. (2006). When work and family are allies: A theory of work-family enrichment. Academy of Management Review, 25, 178–199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Although work interface with family (WIF) and family interface with work (FIW) are strongly correlated, more attention has been directed toward WIF. Research, largely attributed to the idea Ariel Russel Hochschild termed the "ideal worker", depicts the inelastic nature of work roles and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie Russell. 1997. The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work. New York: Metropolitan Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations employers hold of an "ideal worker" already rest on unrealistic assumptions about how the family should operate. Many employers expect that employees with families have someone tending to everything at home, leaving the worker unencumbered. Despite the fact that a majority of families in the U.S are dual earning, the image of the "ideal worker" persists, presenting '''work-family conflict'''.

Workaholism correlates with experiences of '''work-to-family conflict''', since one's priority of work may interfere with family commitments.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; In its simplest form, workaholism is said to be a substantial investment in one’s work.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726703056003613|title=Workaholism: It's Definition and Nature|last=Harpaz|first=Itzhak|date=March 2003|website=Sage journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who is said to be involved in the act of workaholism can be labeled as a [[workaholic]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Workaholism is said to be multifaceted and multi-directional.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;The flexibility and satisfaction within one’s job has an impact on an employee’s happiness and satisfaction in the home and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An overabundance of work has been said to take priority over everyone and everything else in the lives of those infatuated with work. Excessive work prevents one from forming and maintaining intimate relationships and close friendships.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Workaholics are known to spend a vast amount of time in work related activities, which then results in the sacrifice of crucial family, social, and recreational activities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Marital problems, trouble with maintaining close relationships, and isolation from friends and family are the common issues related to workaholism and those involved.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In most recent years, employers have become more aware of the strain and stress that work can place on an employee. Companies have since started seeing their employees not only as workers, but also as people with personal and home lives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;Implementation of family-responsive human resource practices and policies that promote work-family balance have become a reality as a way to reduce stress in both environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Implications for organizations ==
With the struggles of work-family conflict, options are necessary to provide a solution for these problems. Loehr and Schwartz compare the extreme demands experienced by an individual in the workplace to that of a professional athlete.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete|title=The Making of a Corporate Athlete|date=2001-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both scenarios energy expenditure (stress) is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Without recovery (oscillation) both cannot perform to their greatest ability, eventually leading to [[chronic stress]], burnout, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Persist stress without oscillation and the result will be permanent damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Creating an environment that values oscillation, for instance encouraging 15-minute walk breaks throughout the workday or offering corporate gym memberships, can improve employee cognition, energy, focus, and [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Companies, along with their bottom line and employees, win when mental and physical health are treated as equally important to cognitive capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to gain competitive advantage, organizations are attempting to be portrayed as work-life balance supportive employers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mescher|first=Samula|last2=Benschop|first2=Yvonne|last3=Doorewaard|first3=Hans|title=Representations of work—life balance support|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libweb.uwlax.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726709349197|journal=Human Relations|volume=63|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1177/0018726709349197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that value employee work-life balance are able to attract and retain satisfied employees, improve worker performance, and boost employee morale and organization identification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Work-family conflict can be diminished by establishing family-friendly policies in the workplace. Some of these policies include maternity, paternity, parental, sick leaves, and health care insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, J. (2001). International Policies Toward Parental Leave and Child Care. Caring for Infants and Toddlers, 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations may provide child care options either as an on-site child care center at the business, references to close child care centers, or supplemented child care incomes for the families placing their children in a child care center.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, J. (2001). International Policies Toward Parental Leave and Child Care. Caring for Infants and Toddlers, 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

With advances in technology, individuals who work outside the home and have intense schedules are finding ways to keep in touch with their families when they cannot physically be with them. "Technology has provided a bit of an upper hand, allowing them unprecedented control and creativity in maneuvering the tenuous balance between work and family" (Temple, 2009). Organizations are now able to implement [[telecommuting]] policies which allow employees to work from home&lt;ref&gt;Pitt-Catsouphes, Marcie; Casy, Judi; Shulkin, Sandee; Weber, Julie; Curlew, Mary. (2009). Telework and Telecommuting: Policy Briefing Series. Boston: Sloan Work and Family Research Network. [https://workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/sites/workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/files/imported/pdfs/policy_makers3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and provide more flexibility and control over their schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, S. B., &amp; Glass, J. L. (1997). The Family Responsive Workplace. Annual Review of Sociology, 289–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of gender==
The role of gender is a large factor in work-family conflict because one's gender may determine their role in the home or work place. Female representation in the workplace is a direct result of power operating covertly through ideological controls.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082"&gt;King, E. (2008). The effect of bias and unrealistic on the advancement of working mothers: Disentangling legitimate concerns from inaccurate stereotypes as predictors of advancement in academe. Human Relations, 61, 1677–1711. {{doi|10.1177/0018726708098082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the basic assumption of an "ideal worker."&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; Many organizations view the ideal worker as one who is "committed to their work above all else".&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt;  Ideal workers are those that complete tasks beyond their formal and assigned behaviors, seen as a positive and valuable attribute to the organization.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; Individuals having to divide their time (and their commitments) between family and work are perceived as less dedicated to the organization.&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; A manager's perception of a subordinate's role and commitment to the organization is positively associated with the individual's promotability.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hoobler, J., Wayne, S. &amp; Lemmon, G. (2009). Bosses' perception of family-work conflict and women's promotability: Glad ceiling effects. Academy of Management Journal, 52, 5, 939–957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager expectations of an ideal worker are often placed on female workers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cinnamon Gali|first1=Rachel|last2=Rich|first2=Yisrael|date=December 2002|title=Gender Differences in the Importance of Work and Family Roles: Implications for Work–Family Conflict|url=https://link-springer-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1022021804846.pdf|journal=Sex Roles|volume=47|issue=11-12|pages=531-541|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since female workers are both part of the workforce and have significant responsibilities at home, they experience a greater bearing of work-life conflict.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Female employees, who managers perceive to be juggling work and family commitments, were presumed to be less committed to the organization, therefore not worthy of advancement.  Women in the workforce may be "inaccurately perceived to have less commitment to their organizations than their counterparts. Their advancement in organizations may be unfairly obstructed".&lt;ref name="King, E. 20082" /&gt; Males are perceived to be extremely dedicated to their organization because they experience lower levels of work-family conflict.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Merideth|last2=Carlson|first2=Dawn|last3=Hunter|first3=Emily|last4=Whitten|first4=Dwayne|date=October 2012|title=A two-study examination of work–family conflict, production deviance and gender|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/science/article/pii/S0001879112001017|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=81|issue=2|pages=245-258|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2012.07.004|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male individual may be unmarried and have no thought as to what "typical" family responsibilities entail because they simply have not had the experience.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/docview/1651315091/fulltextPDF/D0B037A68F9247FBPQ/1?accountid=9435|title=Gender role beliefs and fathers' work family conflict|last1=Hergatt Huffman|first1=Ann|last2=Olson|first2=Kristine|website=ProQuest|publisher=Emerald Publishing|accessdate=25 March 2018|last3=O'Gara Jr.|first3=Thomas|last4=King|first4=Eden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male may be married, but his wife, due to the demands of the husband's position, has remained at home, tending solely to the house and children and experiencing the "typical" family responsibilities. Since the wife is the one who stays home and tends to the children, the husband is more present in the workforce, representing the higher percentage of males at the top of the [[Hierarchy|organization hierarchy]]. Ironically, these are the individuals creating and reforming workplace policies.&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002"&gt;Williams, J. (2000). Unbending gender: Why family and work conflict and what to do about it. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[motherhood penalty]] is a term sociologists use when arguing that in the workplace working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Deborah|author2=Melissa Binder|author3=Kate Krause|year=2003|title=The Motherhood Wage Penalty Revisited: Experience, Heterogeneity, Work effort and Work-Schedule Flexibility|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=56|pages=273–294|doi=10.2307/3590938}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their place of work, women may suffer a per-child wage penalty, leading to a pay gap between mothers and non-mothers that is larger than the gap between men and women. Not only do working mothers have the burden of balancing work and home life, but they also have to prove they are as dedicated as other employees.&lt;ref name="Paik"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=S.|author2=S. Bernard|author3=I. Paik|year=2007|title=Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?|journal=American Journal of Sociology|pages=1297–1338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers tend to suffer less favorable job-site evaluations compared to non-mothers, stating that mothers are much less committed to their jobs, less authoritative, and less dependable than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt; Hence, mothers may experience discrimination is terms of pay, hiring, and day-to-day job experience.&lt;ref name="BudigEngland"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budig|first=Michelle|author2=Paula England|year=2001|title=The Wage Penalty for Motherhood|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2657415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way in which companies have shaped the "ideal worker" does not compliment the family lifestyle, nor does it accommodate it.&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002" /&gt;  Long hours and near complete devotion to the profession make it difficult for working mothers to participate in, or get ahead in the workplace while maintaining a home and family .&lt;ref name="Williams, J. 20002" /&gt;
