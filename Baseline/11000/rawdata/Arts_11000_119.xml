{{wiktionary|agon}}

'''Agon''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀγών}}) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in [[chariot#Greece|chariot]] or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in [[tragedy]] by its fundamental characters, the [[protagonist]] and antagonist.

== Athletics ==

In one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the [[Ancient Olympic games|Olympic Games]] (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ Ἀγῶνες). Agon was also a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] personification of the contests listed above.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This god was represented in a statue at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] with ''[[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]]'' ([[dumbbells]]) ({{lang|grc|ἁλτῆρες}}) in his hands.  This statue was a work of [[Dionysius (sculptor)|Dionysius]], and dedicated by Micythus of [[Rhegium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', book V (Elis), v. 26. § 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==

Agon also referred to a challenge that was held in connection with [[religious festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trapido (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; With a further religious meaning as used in [[1 Timothy]] 6:12 in the [[New Testament]] and defined by [[Strong's Concordance]] as, agón: a gathering, contest, struggle; as an (athletic) contest; hence, a struggle (in the soul).&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/73.htm Strong's Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theater ==

In [[Ancient Greek theatre|Ancient Greek drama]], particularly [[Old Comedy]] (fifth century B.C.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Milton W.|title=The Agon of the Old Comedy|journal=The American Journal of Philology|date=1887|volume=8|issue=2| pages=179–206|doi=10.2307/287385|jstor=287385}}&lt;/ref&gt; agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the prot''agonist'' and the ant''agonist'' - in the highly structured Classical [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[drama]]s. The agon could also develop between an [[acting|actor]] and the [[choir]] or between two actors with half of the chorus supporting each. Through the argument of opposing principles, the agon in these performances resembled the dialectic dialogues of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;["agon." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 17 Feb. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term has escaped the circumscriptions of its classical origins to signify, more generally, the conflict on which a literary work turns.

==Dance==
In 1948, [[Lincoln Kirstein]] posed the idea of a ballet that would later become known as ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]''. After ten years of work before ''Agon'''s premiere, it became the final ballet in a series of collaborations between choreographer [[George Balanchine]] and composer [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alm |first1=Irene |title=Stravinsky, Balanchine, and Agon: An Analysis Based on the Collaborative Process |journal=The Journal of Musicology |date=April 1989 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=254–269 |doi=10.2307/763771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balanchine referred to this ballet as "the most perfect work" to come out of the collaboration between Stravinsky and himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=Stephanie |title=Agon: A Musical/Choreographic Analysis |journal=Dance Research Journal |date=Autumn 1993 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.2307/1478549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

[[Harold Bloom]] in ''The Western Canon'' uses the term ''agon'' to refer to the attempt by a writer to resolve an intellectual conflict between his ideas and the ideas of an influential predecessor in which "the larger swallows the smaller", such as in chapter 18, [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s agon with [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

In "Man, Play, and Games" [[Roger Caillois]] uses the term Agon to define games of competitive nature.

== Sociopolitical theory ==
In sociopolitical theory, agon can refer to the idea that the clash of opposing forces necessarily results in growth and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Colaguori 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
Words derived from ''agon'' include [[wikt:agony|agony]], [[wikt:agonism|agonism]], [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]], and [[wikt:protagonist|protagonist]].

[[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]] cultures are rich and diverse, and their art forms are representations of their history, skills, tradition, adaptation, and nearly twenty thousand years of continuous life in some of the most remote places on earth. These art forms are largely unseen and unknown outside the state of [[Alaska]], due to distance from the art markets of the world.

==History==
[[File:Ak moosehair tufting.jpg|thumb|Moose hair tufting on an [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] beaded hide box, [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]]]

Historically, "art" as a [[decorative]] concept did not traditionally exist among these indigenous people. Objects were utilitarian, although decorated in ways that conveyed images of spiritual or physical activity. It was not until Europeans and Asians first made contact with the indigenous people of coastal Alaska in the 17th century that such non-utilitarian art objects began to be traded in exchange for metal implements, cloth, and foodstuffs such as tea, flour, or sugar.

Many objects traded were valued for their functionality: clothing woven of grass, harpoon tips carved from the [[ivory]] tusk of the walrus; rainproof outerwear sewn from membranes in the intestines of seals; and animal skins valued for their warmth and durability. Gradually, these items were refined to be more decorative, as a way to increase their value in trade. For example, a [[walrus]] tusk might be etched with many hunting scenes depicting life of the coastal people; later, this technique would come to be known as "[[scrimshaw]]" when brought back to [[New England]] on [[whaling]] ships. Elaborate patterns in [[beadwork]] were designed as the beads themselves arrived through trade; [[Regalia]] of all types used for ceremonial purposes – masks, woven clothing, hats, dance fans – all became souvenirs for the [[whaling|whalers]] and [[Exploration|explorers]] of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Even the towering [[totem poles]] from Southeastern Alaska found their way back to the East Coast of the United States, where they formed the basis of many museum collections.
[[File:Chilkat blanket univ alaska museum.jpg|thumb|left|Chilkat blanket, collection of the [[University of Alaska Museum of the North]]]]

While the art forms were and still are as different as the cultures of the Native people who made them – [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] Indians of the vast Interior, [[Inupiaq]] of the Northwestern [[Arctic]] coasts; [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and [[St. Lawrence Island]] Yupik of the [[Bering Sea]] coast; [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s and [[Alutiiq]] people from the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] islands; and the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Tsimshian]] Indians often known as Northwest Coastal tribes – they commonly evoke references to living in harmony with nature and all its many creatures. No part of an animal hunted, fished or trapped could be wasted, for example, so one might see boots or "[[mukluks]]" made of bearded seal skin for soles, salmon skin for the outer layer, and straps of [[caribou]] or deerskin, perhaps even dyed with berries. As Native people lived off the land and the sea, their relationships to a particular place could always be seen in their objects in both physical and metaphorical terms. As traditions evolved through more "westernization" with [[Russian America]] in the 17th century and [[Alaska Territory|Territorial Alaska]] beginning in 1867 and finally the creation of Alaska as our [[49th State]] in 1959, so did their art forms.

All are continually evolving, blurring the distinction between what an art critic today might want to categorize as "traditional" versus "contemporary" [[Native American art|Native art]]. And contemporary, international art values have a place in Alaska Native art. Wall-size paintings, three-dimensional mobiles, life-size bronze castings and marble [[sculpture]]s, to name just a few categories, fill galleries alongside bears carved from [[whalebone]]s, cribbage boards honed from full-length walrus tusks, fine jewelry etched of copper and silvers; [[Nephrite]] [[jade]] and [[musk ox]] horn polished into bracelets, [[bentwood]] boxes carved from coastal white cedar trees; and baskets of infinite shapes and designs, from [[birch bark]] or woven spruce root, beach grasses or the [[baleen]] from a [[bowhead whale]], all intricately woven and shaped into vessels of all sizes.

==Specific tribes and their art forms==
'''The [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] tribes''' create useful tools such as bows, arrows, harpoons, float discs, snow beaters, boot sole creasers, skin scrapers, fat removers, spoons, handles, rope, belts and other clothing from materials they find locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bockstoce | first = J.R. | title = Eskimos of Northwest Alaska in the Early Nineteenth Century | publisher = Oxprint Limited | year = 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials include fish skin, [[caribou]] hide, polar bear fur, whale baleen ([[baleen basketry]]), old ivory and seal (all parts of each animal are normally used somehow for tool-making if not consumed).&lt;ref name=eskart&gt;Ray, Dorothy Jean. ''Eskimo Art: Tradition and Innovation in North Alaska.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-295-95518-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Masks were often made for ceremonial purposes, bringing the people, animals and spirits together in one being.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; Traditionally sculptures are not made for decoration, but as "good luck amulets" for hunting, or sometimes they are toys for small children.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; Objects are often colored with charcoal and then a layer of fish oil was also applied to assure it does not rub off.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; Although contemporary commercial paints are commonly used today. Mukluks (shoes) and [[parka]]s (jackets) were sewn by the women out of animal hides and were generally only elaborately decorated for ceremonies.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; This art form is called "skin-sewing."

[[File:Cupik kayak stanchions.jpg|thumb|Cup'ik [[kayak]] stanchions, collection of the [[University of Alaska Museum of the North]]. The left is a male figure, while the right is female.]]
'''The [[Yup'ik]] tribes''' traditionally decorate most all of their tools, even ones that perform smaller functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ray | first = Dorothy | title = Artists of the Tundra and the Sea | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their most popular forms of art are [[Yup'ik masks|masks]], which are generally made of wood and range in size from a few inches tall to several pounds in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/riordan/index.html | title = The Living Tradition of Yup'ik Masks | accessdate = September 27, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080925212315/http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/riordan/index.html| archivedate= 25 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They most often create masks for ceremonies but the masks are traditionally destroyed after being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Feinup-Riordan | first = Ann | title = Yup'ik Elders at the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin: Fieldwork Turned on Its Head | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These masks are used to bring the person wearing it luck and good fortune in hunts.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| title = Masks with the Power of Transfiguration
| journal = New York Times
| year = 1997
| author = Reif, Rita}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masks are the result of multiple persons efforts, sometimes created by one in mind but physically created by another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ray | first = Dorothy | title = Eskimo Masks: Art and Ceremony | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] tribes'''' artwork is also frequently functional. Their artwork often consists of clothing and carvings, including canoes and totem poles, which are still well-recognized today. The tools generally used for carving are knives, traditionally made of shell, stone or bone, depending on the artist and what its purpose. The materials that are carved were bone of sheep or goat, and most often wood. Many types of wood are found in the southeastern panhandle of Alaska; some major species include cedar (both yellow and red) for totems and canoes, and finally, alder is used in making dishes and utensils for eating since that wood does not impart its taste onto food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denaliincorporated.com/Pages/tart.htm | title=More About the Tlingit Native American Art | accessdate = September 27, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006224553/http://www.denaliincorporated.com/Pages/tart.htm| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Totem poles always tell a story, since the Tlingit culture traditional is an oral culture with minimal written history. Each animal on a totem pole represent family crests or tells a specific story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Corser | first = Harry Prosper | title = Totem Lore of the Alaska Indians | publisher = Unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

With the advent of the internet, all of these art forms can now be seen and appreciated from anywhere. The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]], a non-profit organization, is dedicated to supporting Native artists and their [[subsistence]] lifestyles based on living in harmony with the environment. The [[University of Alaska, Fairbanks]] has a Native art program, created in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips 240&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5823">'''Alfred A. Hoffy''' (1796–1872) was a mid 19th century American [[lithography|lithographer]] and [[botanical illustrator]] who founded the first American periodical devoted solely to fruit cultivation.&lt;ref name=cu/&gt;&lt;ref name=nap/&gt;&lt;ref name=libco/&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Chang and Eng the Siamese twins, one holding a book. Lithograph Wellcome V0007364.jpg|150 px|right|Siamese twins Chang and Eng, promotional lithograph by Alfred Hoffy c.1836–37.]]

Alfred Hoffy was born in London, England, in 1796. As a young man he joined the British Army and rose to the rank of major. He fought in the [[Battle of Waterloo]], during which he served as an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Duke of Wellington]], and later commanded his own regiment.&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

In 1830, Hoffy left the army and emigrated to the United States, landing in New York, where he went into business with the British lithographer J.T. Bowen.&lt;ref name=libco/&gt; In 1837, he created a well-known lithographic portrait of the [[conjoined twins]] [[Chang and Eng Bunker]].&lt;ref name=libco/&gt; Around 1838, Bowen and Hoffy moved their lithography business to Philadelphia, where Hoffy created lithographic illustrations for  the local newspaper, ''[[The North American]]''. His subjects ranged from news events—the arrival of an Egyptian sarcophagus in Philadelphia; the 1835 [[Great Fire of New York]]—to portraits drawn from [[daguerreotypes]] of such well-known people as General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] and financier [[Cyrus West Field]].&lt;ref name=libco/&gt; He also produced many of the plates for the fashion periodical ''U.S. Military Magazine'' published by Duval and Huddy between 1839 and 1842&lt;ref name=libco/&gt; and contributed lithographic plates to [[Thomas McKenney]] and [[James Hall (writer)|James Hall]]'s ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.

[[File:George Mifflin Dallas.jpg|150 px|right|U.S. Vice-President [[George Mifflin Dallas]] in a lithography by Alfred Hoffy after a daguerreotype by M.A. Root.]]

In Philadelphia, Hoffy married Emma Jane Patterson, with whom he had six daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

Hoffy was very  interested in fruit production in America, and in the early 1840s, he founded a periodical on American fruit with color plates that he intended would match the quality of those found in European journals. ''Hoffy's Orchardist's Companion: A Quarterly Journal, Devoted to the History, Character, Properties, Modes of Cultivation, and All Other Matters Appertaining to the Fruits of the United States'' was praised in the local and national press for its usefulness and especially for the "superb colored engravings of fruits".&lt;ref name=nap/&gt; Despite this, just 5 issues were published over two years (1841–43) before Hoffy had to stop because production proved to be too expensive and he could not cover his costs.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; ''Hoffy's Orchardist's Companion'' was the first American periodical devoted solely to fruit cultivation.&lt;ref name=cu/&gt;&lt;ref name=nap/&gt;

[[File:Hoffy Howell-pear-1860.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Howell pear by Alfred A. Hoffy, from ''Hoffy's North American Pomologist'', 1860.]]

Following this, Hoffy began work with the physician and amateur [[pomologist]] William D. Brincklé on a new series of publications on native North American fruits to be published under the general title ''North American Pomologist''.&lt;ref name=nap/&gt; Individual volumes would be edited by Brincklé (who was for many years the vice-president of the Philadelphia Horticultural Society) and would consist of 36 pages of information on different kinds of fruit illustrated with 10 color plates.&lt;ref name=nap/&gt;&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; The illustrations were produced as stone lithographs drawn by Hoffy (signed "From Nature by A. Hoffy") and colored under his direction.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; The fruit is usually shown in a full-color side view, sometimes accompanied by a simple black outline of the fruit's profile. Hoffy and Brincklé felt this series was needed because of "repeated disappointments which have attended the cultivation of Foreign Fruits in this country"&lt;ref name=nap/&gt; and also to clear up increasing confusion over common fruit names. The entire series was published together in 1860 in a single volume as ''Hoffy's North American Pomologist''.

In the late 1860s, Hoffy moved his family to Brooklyn, New York, where he died on March 10, 1872. He is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10663">'''Andreas Constantine Papadakis''' FLS (17 June 1938 – 10 June 2008) was a Cypriot-born British academic, entrepreneur and leading figure in the field of [[Publishing|architectural publishing]]. He opened the Academy Bookshop in [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]], Kensington in 1964 and moved into publishing as Academy Editions in 1968. From then until 1990, when he sold the company to VCH Germany (now part of [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]]) he published more than a thousand titles mainly on art, architecture and the decorative arts.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Anon.

[internet] Available at: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4424818.ece &lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to publish (in USA - [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]] 'and latter [[St. Martin's Press]]) many international architects in the  'Architectural Monographs No...' series,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_adv_b/?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;unfiltered=1&amp;field-keywords=&amp;field-author=&amp;field-title=Architectural+Monographs+No&amp;field-isbn=&amp;field-publisher=&amp;node=&amp;url=&amp;field-feature_browse-bin=&amp;field-binding_browse-bin=&amp;field-subject=&amp;field-language=&amp;field-dateop=&amp;field-datemod=&amp;field-dateyear=&amp;sort=price&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=26&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=16 Architectural Monographs No...]&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[Alvar Aalto]] (No 4), [[Michael Graves]] (No 5), [[Edwin Lutyens]] (No 6), [[John Soane]] (No 8), [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] (No 9), [[Richard Rogers]] (No 10), [[Mies van der Rohe]] (No 11), [[Hassan Fathy]] (No 13), [[Tadao Ando]] (No 14), [[Daniel Libeskind]] (No 16), etc.; and Victor Arwas’s ''Art Deco'', first published in 1980 remains the standard work on the subject.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Anon. (2008) Andreas Papadakis, ''Telegraph.co.uk'', 18 Aug. [internet] Available at: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2581290/Andreas-Papadakis.html &lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Papadakis was born in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] on 17 June 1938 and relocated to London in 1956. He obtained a DIC from [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and a PhD from [[Brunel University]]. In 1964 he bought a house in Holland Street, [[Kensington]] without realising that the shop (then a dry cleaners) on the ground floor could not be used for residential purposes.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; He decided to open a bookshop. The Academy Bookshop began as a general bookshop. His first publications were finely bound limited editions of other publishers’ books but he soon decided that he would prefer to make his own and began in 1967 with a large format paperback of [[Aubrey Beardsley]]’s prints, an ideal title to attract the customers of [[Biba]], who had recently opened her shop just round the corner in Kensington Church Street. The Beardsley book was still in print when Academy was sold in 1990.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Academy Editions &amp; ''Architectural Design''==
In 1971 Papadakis expanded his fast-growing business with the acquisition of the Tiranti publishing company and the London Art Bookshop. He moved the shop to No. 8 Holland Street, just opposite the Academy Bookshop and set about expanding the combined Academy/Tiranti list. Early publications included Jim Burns’s ''Arthropods'', Roger Bilcliffe’s ''Charles Rennie Mackintosh'', [[Bernard Rudofsky|Rudofsky]]’s [[Architecture Without Architects|''Architecture without Architects'']], [[Reyner Banham]]’s ''Design by Choice'', ''Alphonse Mucha, Complete Graphic Works'', and [[Rudolf Wittkower|Wittkower]]’s ''Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism''.

In 1975 Papadakis bought the financially troubled ''Architectural Design'' magazine. This created some controversy because of his non-architectural background and his unwillingness to give his unconditional support to one particular architectural style.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;Latham, I. (1988) Anniversaries: Edited Highlights. ''Building Design'', 30 Sep. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;Pearman, H. (1993) Function Follows Farm. ''The Sunday Times'', 25 Jul. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy increased with the publication of [[Charles Jencks]]’s ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'' in 1977, which was in its sixth edition by the time he sold Academy in 1990.

Both ''Architectural Design'' and Academy Editions continued to publish [[Postmodern architecture|Post-Modern]], [[Classical architecture|Classical]] and [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] projects throughout the 1980s while Papadakis himself actively fostered the pluralist debate through seminars, conferences and exhibitions at the [[University of Westminster|Polytechnic of Central London]], the [[Architectural Association]], the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]], the [[German Architecture Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]], and through his Academy Forums at the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] and the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]], where he also founded the annual Architecture Lecture.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

In 1990, Papadakis sold what was by now the Academy Group Ltd. with ''Architectural Design'' and the journals he had founded: ''Architectural Monographs'', ''Art and Design'' and the ''Journal of Philosophy and the Visual Arts''. He left the group at the end of 1992 and was banned by a non-competition clause from publishing for five years.&lt;ref name="bdd"&gt;Anon. (1993) Rise and Fall of PoMo King. ''Building Design'', 15 Jan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papadakis Publisher and Restoration Projects==
In 1997, Papadakis founded a new publishing house, Papadakis Publisher, with his daughter Alexandra. In addition to books on architecture and the decorative arts the company broadened its scope to include books on natural science, including the acclaimed&lt;ref name="seedscience"&gt;Thompson, K. (2007) Book Review: Seeds, Time Capsules of Life. ''Seed Science Research'' 17, p. 71 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Anon.

''Time Magazine Online'', [internet] Available at: http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1846523_1775210,00.html &lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;Richins, V. (2008) Fruit: Edible, Inedible, Incredible. ''About.com'', [internet] Available at: http://treesandshrubs.about.com/od/bookproductreviews/gr/FruitBookReview.htm&lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; series ''Pollen'', ''Seeds'' and ''Fruit'' in association with the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], leading to his election as a [[Linnean Society of London|Fellow of the Linnean Society]].&lt;ref name="linnean"&gt;Linnean Society of London, The (2006) ''Annual Report 2006'' p. 31 [internet] Available at: http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Publications/Annual_Report_2006_Complete_web.pdf&lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pollen'' and ''Seeds'' were awarded a joint gold medal by the American Independent Publishers’ Association in 2006 as Outstanding Books of the Year, and his first science book ''Why the Lion Grew its Mane'' was long-listed by the [[Royal Society]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

[[File:Church Island House in the Thames, Staines.jpg|thumb|Church Island House in the Thames]]

As Papadakis’s business ventures were increasingly successful, he purchased several properties for restoration, including the medieval Kilbees Farm in [[Winkfield|Winkfield, Berkshire]] and Dauntsey Park House in [[Wiltshire]], although the latter project ended in 2005 when planning permission was refused.&lt;ref name="suntimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphdp"&gt;Aslet, C.

In 1987 Papadakis bought Church Island in the Thames and commissioned Dr. [[Basil Al Bayati]], an architect whose books 'Architect'&lt;ref name=architect&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; he had published, to design a house for him.
“For his luxury mansion on his Greek-island-in-the-Thames, the great man chose not Michael Graves, one of the deconstructivists or even CZWG, but pragmatic classicist Basil Al Bayati, whom he instructed to design a country house in the English turn-of-the-century manner.”&lt;ref name="secondcoming"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan of the house is based on multiple units of structural geometrical forms and utilises extensive brickwork in a postmodern, art &amp; craft style.  It was “designed in a vernacular manner, using building materials similar to those traditionally used in the area.”

In 1988, Church Island House was exhibited at the [[German Architecture Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]] in an exhibition titled The Architecture of Pluralism that included work by [[James Gowan]], [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]], [[Charles Jencks]] and some twenty other internationally recognised architects.

In 2007 he purchased [[Monkey Island, Bray|Monkey Island Hotel]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]] but died a few months afterwards.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

'''Anonymous works''' are works, such as [[art]] or [[literature]], that have an [[Anonymity|anonymous]], undisclosed, or unknown creator or author. In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. There are a number of reasons anonymous works arise.

== Description ==
In the [[United States]], anonymous work is legally defined as "a work on the copies or [[phonorecord]]s of which no [[natural person]] is identified as [[author]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|title=Selected Sections of the Copyright Act|date=1997-12-17|accessdate=2008-06-22|work=UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185159/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|archivedate=11 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. In such cases the author is often referred to as [[Wikt:anonymus|Anonymus]], the [[Latin]]  form of "anonymous". In other cases, the creator's name is intentionally kept secret. The author's reasons may vary from fear of [[persecution]] to protection of his or her reputation.  Legal reasons may also bar an author from self-identifying, as in 2007, when ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an article by an anonymous author—who would have preferred to be named—describing the use of [[national security letters]] by the [[FBI]].{{cn|date=August 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">'''Visual arts in Finland''' started to form its individual characteristics in the 19th century, when [[Romantic nationalism]] was rising in autonomic [[Finland]].

[[File:Väinämöisen soitto1.jpg|thumb|Robert Wilhelm Ekman, Väinämöisen soitto, 1866.]]

== Prehistoric art ==
The oldest marks of human activity in Finland has found in [[Wolf cave|Susiluola]], [[Kristiinankaupunki]]. Some excavation has been considered as a man-made over 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="kansallismuseo.fi"&gt;http://www.kansallismuseo.fi/en/nationalmuseum/exhibitions/permanent&lt;/ref&gt; After the Ice Age, area of Finland was resettled at around 9,000 years ago and first known sculpture [[Elk's Head of Huittinen]] (picture in stamp) has been dated about 5–7000 BCE.&lt;ref name="kansallismuseo.fi"/&gt;

==Medieval period==
[[File:Turun tuomiokirkko talvella.JPG|thumb|Turku Cathedral.]]
The most important products of medieval architecture in Finland are the medieval stone churches. More than a hundred of them were built during 15th and 16th centuries. [[Neoclassical architecture]] arrived in late 18th century, but important building projects started after 1808 when Finland was an autonomic part of Russia. [[Alexander II of Russia]] commissioned [[Carl Ludvig Engel]] to plan the new Senate and University for Helsinki.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/24652/Suomen%20taidehistoria%202011.pdf?sequence=5 |title= Suomen Taidehistoria |last1=Hiekkanen |first1=Markus |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |website=Taidehistoria, Helsingin yliopisto |publisher=Helsinki University |language=fi |access-date=2015-10-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic visual arts==
The Finnish academic drawing tradition began at [[Royal Academy of Turku]] in 1707 when first instructions of drawing was given. In 1824 The School moves with the University to [[Helsinki]] and first Finland’s art exhibition was organised at the Drawing School in the autumn of 1845. Painting was rising in Golden era of Finnish art in 1880s, when [[romantic nationalism]] was the spirit of art. [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] started in naturalism but moved to national romanticism.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt;

In 1950s the Finnish artists looked for foreign influence: first in Paris, then in United States but also in Stockholm, where modern art exhibitions were organized in Moderna museet. Abstract art made its breakthrough first in [[concrete art]]. Early concretists included [[Birger Carlstedt]] and [[Sam Vanni]]. When Vanni's monumental painting ''Contrapunctus'' (1959) won competition for mural in Helsinki, abstract art was considered to be accepted and established in Finland.&lt;ref name="CEN"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ehtiihanpariisiin.keskisuomentaide.fi/artikkelit/kuvataide-suomessa/ |title= Kuvataide Suomessa 1950- ja 1960-luvuilla |last1= Heinänen  |first1= Seija |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Ehtiihän Pariisiin |publisher= Art Museum in Jyväskylä |access-date=2015-10-25 | language=fi |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Informalism]] spread quickly in 1950s and 1960s, when it was considered a new approach to [[landscape painting]]. It was also building on strong tradition of expressionism. It spread even outside of large cities.&lt;ref name="CEN"/&gt;

The Finnish contemporary art scene became much more visible than before with the establishment of [[Kiasma]], the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.artsy.net/article/editorial-number-focusfinland-your-crash-course-on-finlands-contemporary |title= #FocusFinland: Your Crash Course on Finland’s Contemporary Art Scene |date= 2014 |website= |publisher= Artsy |access-date=2015-10-25  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edirne Balkan Şehitliği.jpg|thumb|left|Monument in the Balkan Wars Memorial Cemetery in Edirne.]]
The '''Balkan Wars Memorial Cemetery in Edirne''' ({{lang-tr|Edirne Balkan Savaşı Şehitliği}}), located at Sarayiçi quarter of [[Edirne]], Turkey, is a memorial burial ground for [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military personnel of the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913), who were [[killed in action]] during the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912–13)]]. It was opened to public on January 14, 1994.

Situated on the west bank of the [[Tundzha|Tunca]] north of Edirne, the memorial cemetery is laid out over {{convert|858|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}. Designed by architect Nejat Dinçel and built as a [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], it contains in twelve blocks the names of 100 officers and 400 soldiers on plaques.

In front of the memorial cemetery, an unknown-soldier monument with a bronze statue of an Ottoman soldier ({{lang-tr|Mehmetçik}}) is erected, which was created by sculptor [[Tankut Öktem]]. The reliefs in the memorial depicting the Balkan Wars are of [[Metin Yurdanur]].

==Background==
After Edirne was captured by the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]n 2nd Army on March 26, 1913, Turkish [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POW) were put in a camp at Sarayiçi, who were treated with brutality.&lt;ref name="Jews, Turks page 187"/&gt; Around 10,000 POWs died due to cold, sickness and starvation.&lt;ref name="eh1"/&gt; Only the names of few military personnel could be determined from the records of the General Staff.

On March 26, 2015, the 102nd anniversary of the fall of the city was commemorated at the memorial cemetery.&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt;

'''''Biathanatos''''' is a work by the English writer and clergyman [[John Donne]]. Written in 1608 and published after his death, it contains a [[heterodox]] defense of self-homicide (suicide), listing prominent Biblical examples including [[Jesus]], [[Samson]], [[Saul]], and [[Judas Iscariot]]. [[Thomas de Quincey]] responds to the work in his ''Writings VIII'', page 336, and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] responds in ''Biathanatos'', in his collected [[non-fiction]].

'''''Brief Interviews with Hideous Men''''' (1999) is a collection of 23 short stories by American writer [[David Foster Wallace]]. Four of the stories are entitled "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men" and are presented as transcripts of interviews with male subjects. The interviewer's questions are omitted from the transcripts, rendered merely as "Q." These stories and the rest of the collection are characterized by dark dry humor, alienation, and unconventional sexuality.

In 1997 Wallace was awarded the [[Aga Khan Prize for Fiction]] by editors of'' [[The Paris Review]]'' for "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men #6", which had appeared in the magazine and appears as "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men #20" in the collection.

Twelve of the "Interviews" were adapted into a stage play (''Hideous Men'') by [[Dylan McCullough]] in 2000, marking the first theatrical adaptation of any of Wallace's works. McCullough directed the premiere at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000.

In August 2012 British artists [[Andy Holden (artist)|Andy Holden]] and [http://www.davidraymondconroy.co.uk/ David Raymond Conroy] presented a stage adaptation of the book at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]], London,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ica.org.uk/blog/andy-holden-and-david-raymond-conroy-conversation-anna-gritz&lt;/ref&gt; which later toured to [[Arnolfini]], Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men&lt;/ref&gt; The production used a variety of multimedia techniques such as projection of the letter 'Q' on a backdrop that disrupted the monologues and a system of ear-pieces and auto-cues to convey the script to the actors on stage. The adaptation used four of the interviews and one short story and contained new music by [[Andy Holden (artist)|the Grubby Mitts.]]

21 of the interviews and stories were adapted and directed by David McGuff for Yellow Lab Productions entitled "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men." The production ran three nights, August 28–30, 2014, at the Hill Country Arts Foundation's Point Theater on the Elizabeth Huth Coates indoor stage.

[[John Krasinski]] adapted and directed [[Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (film)|a film version]] on the "Brief Interviews" stories that was released in 2009. [[Julianne Nicholson]] plays Sara Quinn, the interviewer unnamed in the stories.

[[File:CLUNY-Coffret Christ 1.JPG|thumb|Christ in majesty in a [[mandorla]], surrounded by emblems of the evangelists: ivory plaques on a wooden coffret, Cologne, first half of the 13th century ([[Musée de Cluny]])]]
'''Christ in Majesty''' or '''Christ in Glory''' ({{lang-la|Maiestas Domini}})&lt;ref&gt;The lexically similar ''[[Maestà]]'', Italian for "majesty", conventionally designates an iconic formula of the enthroned Madonna with the child Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt; is the Christian image of [[Christ]] seated on a throne as ruler of the world, always seen frontally in the centre of the composition, and often flanked by other sacred figures, whose membership changes over time and according to the context. The image develops from [[Early Christian art]], which directly borrowed the formulae of depictions of the enthroned [[Roman Emperor]].  In the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] world, the image developed slightly differently into the half-length [[Christ Pantocrator]], "Christ, Ruler of All", a usually unaccompanied figure, and the [[Deesis]], where a full-length enthroned Christ is entreated by [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[St. John the Baptist]], and often other figures.  In the West, the evolving composition remains very consistent within each period until the [[Renaissance]], and then remains important until the end of the [[Baroque]], in which the image is ordinarily transported to the sky.

==Development==
[[File:1398 - Milano - S. Lorenzo - Cappella S. Aquilino - Traditio Legis - Dall'Orto - 18-May-2007.jpg|thumb|300px|''Traditio legis'', or "transmission of the law," Christ as lawgiver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/traditio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623002048/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/traditio.html |archivedate=2013-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mosaic]], [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan]], 4th century, includes a scroll box at Christ's feet.]]
From the latter part of the fourth century, a still beardless Christ begins to be depicted seated on a throne on a [[dais]], often with his feet on a low stool and usually flanked by Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and in a larger composition the other [[Twelve apostles|apostles]].  The central group of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] of 359 ([[Vatican Museums|Vatican]]) is the earliest example with a clear date.  In some cases Christ hands a [[scroll]] to St Peter on his right, imitating a gesture often made by Emperors handing an Imperial decree or letter of appointment to an official, as in ivory consular [[diptych]]s, on the [[Arch of Constantine]], and the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]].  This depiction is known as the '''''Traditio legis''''' ("handing over the law"), or ''Christ the lawgiver'' - "the apostles are indeed officials, to whom the whole world is entrusted" wrote Saint [[John Chrysostom]].&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; p. 96; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962. Hall pp. 78-80&lt;/ref&gt;  This depiction tends to merge into one of "Christ the teacher", which also derives from classical images of bearded philosophers.

Other Imperial depictions of Christ, standing as a triumphing general, or seated on a ball representing the world, or with different companions, are found in the next centuries. By the seventh century the Byzantine Christ Pantocrator holding a book representing the [[Gospel]]s and raising his right hand has become essentially fixed in the form it retains in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] today.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', pp. 92-3, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Christ Triumphant" had a separate future development, usually standing, often with both hands raised high.
[[File:Deesis Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|left|The Deesis mosaic in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople]]
The Pantocrator figure first became half-length because large versions filled the semi-dome of the [[apse]] of many, if not most, decorated churches. A full-length figure would need to be greatly reduced for the head to make maximum impact from a distance (because of the flattening at the top of the semi-dome).  The gesture Christ makes has become one of blessing, but is originally an [[orator]]s gesture of his right to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Christ in early examples is Christ the Teacher: the gesture of Christ's right hand is not the gesture of blessing, but the orator's gesture; the identical gesture is to be seen in a panel from an ivory [[diptych]] of an enthroned vice-prefect ''([[vicarius]])'', a [[Rufius Probianus]], ca 400, of which Peter Brown remarks, "With his hand he makes the 'orator's gesture' which indicates that he is speaking, or that he has the right to speak." Staatsbibliothek Berlin. Illustrated in Peter Brown, "Church and leadership" in Paul Veyne, editor, ''A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium'' 1987, p 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Deesis'' became standard at the centre of the [[templon]] beam in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches and the templon's successor, the [[iconostasis]], and is also found as a panel [[icon]]. Generally the Pantocrator has no visible throne, but the earlier Deesis does, and at least a single-step dais.  The Deesis continues to appear in Western art, but not as often or in such an invariable composition as in the East.
[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Romanesque [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]], c.1220]]
In the West the image showed a full-length enthroned Christ, often in a [[mandorla]] or other geometrical frame, surrounded by the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], representing the vision of Chapters 4 and 5 of the [[Book of Revelation]].  In the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period the twenty-four [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]] are often seen. Christ also holds a book and makes the blessing gesture, no doubt under Byzantine influence. In both, Christ's head is surrounded by a crossed [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. In Early Medieval Western art the image was very often given a full page in [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Gospel Book]]s, and in metalwork or ivory on their covers, and it remained very common as a large-scale fresco in the semi-dome of the apse in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches, and carved in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of church portals. This "seems to have been almost the only theme of [[apse]]-pictures" in [[Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian]] churches, all of which are now lost, although many examples from the period survive in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus:143&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Romanesque period, the image in the West often began to revert to the earliest, more crowded conception, and [[archangel]]s, apostles and saints, now often all facing inwards towards Christ, appear, as well as the beasts emblematic of the Evangelists and the twenty-four elders.  This development paralleled the movement towards a more "realistic" depiction of the "heavenly court" seen in the increasingly popular subjects of the [[Maestà]] (the enthroned Virgin and Child) and the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by Christ.

A Christ in Majesty became standard carved in the tympanum of a decorated [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church portal, by now surrounded by a large number of much smaller figures around the [[archivolt]]s.  In painting, the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] is the culmination of the Gothic image, although a minority of [[art historian]]s believe that in this case it is [[God the Father]], not Christ, who is shown in majesty.

==Christ in Judgement==
[[File:Florentinischer Meister um 1300 001.jpg|thumb|280px|Florentine [[mosaic]] [[Last Judgement]] of about 1300]]
A variant figure, or the same figure in a different context, of Christ as Judge, became common in [[Last Judgement]]s, often painted on the west (rear) wall of churches.  Here an enthroned Christ, from the 13th century usually with robes pulled aside above the waist to reveal the wounds of the Passion (a motif taken from images of the [[Doubting Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Vol 2, 188-189, 202&lt;/ref&gt;) sits high in a complex composition, with sinners being dragged down by devils to [[Hell]] on the right and the righteous on the left (at Christ's right-hand side) rising up to [[Heaven]].  Generally Christ still looks straight forward at the viewer, but has no book; he often gestures with his hands to direct the damned downwards, and the saved up.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Mâle, ''The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 365-76, English trans of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[High Renaissance]] the subject was more loosely treated; Christ and his court take to the clouds, and are distributed with an eye to a harmonious and "natural" composition rather than the serried ranks of old.  From the late Renaissance and through the Baroque, it often forms the upper part of a picture depicting events on earth in the lower register, and as stricter perspective replaces the hieratic scaling of the Middle Ages, Christ becomes literally diminished.  Such depictions tend not to be described as "Christ in Majesty", although they are the linear development of the earlier image; the main subject has become the human events in the foreground, such as the martyrdom of a saint, to which Christ is now a rather distant witness.

''Merchants, Princes and Painters: Silk Fabrics in Italian and Northern Paintings 1300-1550''. New Haven, Yale University Press, 2008, pp. 295–299&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Damask with floral sprigs, Italy, Baroque, 1600-1650, silk two-tone damask - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC04376.JPG|thumb|Damask with floral sprigs, Italy, Baroque, 1600-1650, silk two-tone damask]]
The production of damask was one of the five basic weaving techniques—the others being [[plain weave|tabby]], [[twill]], [[lampas]], and [[tapestry]]—of the [[Byzantine silk|Byzantine]] and [[Islam]]ic weaving centres of the [[Early Middle Ages|early]] [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=jenkins&gt;Jenkins, David T., ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZljldSpV28UC ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles''], Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-34107-8}}, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Damasks derive their name from the city of [[Damascus]]—in that period a large city active both in trading (as part of the [[silk road]]) and in manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodhomeandgarden.com/damask-fabric "What is Damask Fabric"], Period Home and Garden&lt;/ref&gt; Damasks became scarce after the 9th century outside [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]], but were revived in some places in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt;

The word "damask" first appeared in records in a Western European language in the mid-14th century in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/damas "Damas"] etymology (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 14th century, damasks were being woven on [[loom|draw loom]]s in Italy. From the 14th to 16th century, most damasks were woven in one colour with a glossy warp-faced satin pattern against a duller ground. Two-colour damasks had contrasting colour [[Warp and woof|warps and wefts]], and polychrome damasks added gold and other metallic threads or additional colours as supplemental [[brocade|brocading]] wefts. Medieval damasks were usually woven in silk, but weavers also produced [[wool]] and linen damasks.&lt;ref name="Monnas1" /&gt;

==Modern usage==
[[File:Water droplet lying on a damask.jpg|thumb|left|Damask as a [[tablecloth]]. Water droplet is lying on the surface due to low [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of damask. ]]

Modern damasks are woven on computerized [[Jacquard loom]]s.&lt;ref name="text" /&gt; Damask weaves are commonly produced in monochromatic (single-colour) weaves in silk, linen, or synthetic fibres such as [[rayon]] and feature patterns of flowers, fruit, and other designs. The long floats of satin-woven warp and weft threads cause soft highlights on the fabric which reflect light differently according to the position of the observer. Damask weaves appear most commonly in table linens and furnishing fabrics, but they are also used for clothing. The Damask weave is used extensively throughout the fashion industry due to its versatility and high-quality finish. Damask is usually used for mid-to-high-quality garments, meaning the label tends to have a higher definition and a more “expensive” look.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">The '''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art''' is located on the fourth floor of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[New York City]], United States. 

==History==
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art opened on March 23, 2007 at the Brooklyn Museum as the first public space of its kind in the country; it is a nexus for feminist art, theory, and activism. The {{convert|8300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center, located on the museum's fourth floor, aims to create a compelling and interactive environment to raise awareness and educate future generations about [[feminism]]’s impact on culture.

Since 2007 the Center has been the permanent home of [[Judy Chicago]]'s landmark feminist work ''[[The Dinner Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/arts/19iht-raafemina-28463.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Dana | last=Micucci | title=Feminist art gets place of pride in Brooklyn | date=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kort|first=Michele|title=Home at Last|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/homeatlast.asp|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=[[Ms. Magazine]]|date=Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's Forum is a venue for public programs and a platform of advocacy for women’s issues, and its Feminist Art and Herstory galleries present critically acclaimed [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/exhibitions/index.php exhibitions]. The Council for Feminist Art, a membership group, supports the ongoing educational programming and the continuing success of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The Center's namesake and founder, [[Elizabeth Sackler|Elizabeth A. Sackler]], is a [[philanthropist]] and [[art collector]].

==Layout==
''The Dinner Party''{{’}}s gallery is the centerpiece of a dramatic design for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art that was conceived and developed by award-winning architect [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/susan_rodriguez.php Susan T. Rodriguez], FAIA, a partner in [[Ennead Architects]]. ''The Dinner Party'', which includes 39 placesettings as well as the names of 999 women on a ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]]'', is enclosed in large, canting glass walls that provide a first glimpse of Chicago’s work. It is surrounded by a series of distinct, yet interconnected series of galleries that include two changing exhibition galleries and a study center that can be transformed from an academic forum into a multimedia gallery, as required, by a large pivoting wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery Design|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/gallery_design.php|website=Elizabeth A.

==Feminist Art Base==
An original initiative from the Center for Feminist Art is its “Feminist Art Base.”&lt;ref name="fab" /&gt; This database is a self-generated selection of past and present artists, whose work reflect feminist ideas, investments, and concerns, such as [[Karen Heagle]], [[Julia Kunin]] and Clarity Haynes.  The database is actively added to with artists from the around the world, who continue to build their profiles. Each profile includes short biographies, CVs, and exemplary works as well as a “Feminist Art Statement.” This personal and living database wishes to be a comprehensive resource for achieving the Center’s mission: “''to present feminism in an approachable and relevant manner, to educate new generations about the meaning of feminist art, and to raise awareness of feminism's cultural contributions.''”&lt;ref name="fab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/index.php | title=Feminist Art Base| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Awards==
In March 2012 The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art celebrated its fifth anniversary by honoring fifteen contemporary women with the Sackler Center First Awards. The awards, conceived by Elizabeth Sackler, are given each year to women who have broken a gender barrier to make a remarkable achievement and contribution in her respective field.

[[File:Entrance to the Mall Galleries.JPG|thumb|The Mall Galleries building]]
The '''Federation of British Artists''' (FBA) consists of nine art societies, and is based at '''Mall Galleries''' in [[London]] where the societies' Annual Exhibitions are held. The societies represent living artists working in the [[United Kingdom]] who create contemporary [[figurative art]]. Mall Galleries aim to ‘promote, inspire and educate audiences about the [[visual arts]].’

==Description==

The FBA has over 500 artist-members, who regularly exhibit their work and also accept open submissions from the public. In addition to the member societies, other societies and individual artists also stage shows at Mall Galleries. Over 100 prizes and awards are administered each year by the societies.

The gallery also has a commissions department and Friends organisation. The galleries' education department runs a Schools Programme, which includes gallery based workshops for Primary and Secondary school students.

Gallery projects include a drawing school and summer courses run by the [[New English Art Club]], as well as The [[Hesketh Hubbard Art Society]], the largest life drawing society in London, who meet to draw from life models.

The FBA is a registered charity, number 200048, and was established in 1961.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9027">'''French folklore''' encompasses the [[fables]], [[folklore]] and [[fairy tales]] and [[legend]]s of the [[French people]].

==Folklore from the Middle Ages==
[[Occitan literature]] - were songs, poetry and literature in Occitan in what is nowadays the South of France that originated in the poetry of the 11th and 12th centuries, and inspired vernacular literature throughout medieval Europe. These early recorded songs, poetry and their highest development in the 12th century and includes the well known ''Songs of the Troubadours'':

{{main|Occitan literature}}

===Songs of the Troubadours===
* [[Troubadour|Songs of the Troubadour]] - The songs, poetry and narratives of the [[troubadour]]s, who were composers and performers during the High Middle Ages, flourished during the 11th century and spread throughout Europe from Southern France. Their songs dealt mainly with themes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]. Several established categories of poetry and song were:
**[[Canso (song)|Canso or canson]] were songs concerning courtly love.
**[[Sirventes]] songs covered war, politics, morality, satire, humor, and topics outside of love.
**[[Tenso]] and [[Partiment]] is a dialog or debate between poets
**[[Planh]] is a lament on a death.
**[[Pastorela]] is a song trying to win the affections and love of a shepherdess.
**[[Alba (poetry)|Alba]] is complaint of lovers upon parting.

===Songs of the Trouvère===
[[Trouvère|Songs of the Trouvère]] are songs and poetry that stemmed from poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France.

{{main|Trouvère}}

===Epic Narratives===
A second form of legend in France during the Middle Ages was [[epic poetry]], partly historical and partly legend with themes covering the formation of France, war, kingship, and important battles. This genre was known as [[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]] which is Old French for "songs of heroic deeds." It is also called the epics of the "Matter of France":

====Matter of France====
*[[Chanson de geste]]: [[Matter of France]] was part history and part legendary heroic epic tales of [[Charlemagne]] and the history and founding of [[France]] by the Franks. Some of the legendary and notable topics were:
** [[Charlemagne]], the [[mythological king]]
** [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]
** [[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]] - the legendary horse
** [[Durandal]] - a magical sword
** ''[[Song of Roland]]'' (in French: ''Chanson de Roland'')
***Describes [[Roland]] - the chief [[paladin]] of Charlemagne
** ''[[Huon of Bordeaux]]'' written circa 1215-1240
***Includes very early descriptions of: [[Morgan le Fay]], and son [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]
** [[Renaud de Montauban]] - epic [[hero]]

===Animal fables, mock epics===
Another folkloric medium in the Middle Ages were fables, mock epics and animal folk tales, notably:

* [[Reynard|Reynard Le Roman de Renart]] (circa 1175) by Perrout de Saint Cloude, a mock epic, the first known appearance of the following animals:
* [[Reynard|Reynard the fox]] in literature and folklore, an [[anthropomorphic]] [[fables]] of a fox, [[trickster god|trickster]]
** Bruin the Bear
** Baldwin the Ass
** Tibert (Tybalt) the Cat
** Hirsent the She-wolf

==Satirical tales by Rabelais==
[[François Rabelais]], 1494–1553, wrote:
* [[Gargantua and Pantagruel]] - the story of two giants

==Fairy tales ==
French fairy tales are particularly known by their literary rather than their folk, oral variants.  Perrault derived almost all his tales from folk sources, but rewrote them for the upper-class audience, removing rustic elements.  The [[précieuses]] rewrote them even more extensively for their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Delarue, ''The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales'', p ix-xi, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956&lt;/ref&gt;  Collection of folk tales as such only began about 1860, but was fruitful for the next decades.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Delarue, ''The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales'', p xi-xii, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fairy tales by Perrault ===
[[Charles Perrault]] (1628–1703) collected tales:
* [[Bluebeard]]
* [[Cinderella]] (in 1697)
* [[Diamonds and Toads]]
* [[Donkey Skin]]
* [[Little Red Riding Hood]] (''Le Petit Chaperon Rouge'' in 1697)
* [[Mother Goose|Mother Goose Tales]] (''Contes de ma mère l'Oye'' in 1695)

[[File:Chodowiecki Basedow Tafel 21 c Z.jpg|thumb|300px|An 18th-century printing shop showing the parts of a hand press when they are opened out. The frisket is the right-most portion of the press, with four openings for the pages to be printed. The middle, with the printed sheet on it, is the [[tympan]], and at left, the bed which holds the type being inked.]]
A '''frisket''' is any material that protects areas of a work from unintended change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frisket&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letterpress==
On a sheet-fed [[letterpress printing]] machine, a frisket is a sheet of oiled paper that covers the space between the [[typesetting|type]] or ''cuts'' (illustrations) and the edge of the paper that is to be printed. When the press operator uses a [[brayer]] to coat the surface of the type with ink, the ink brayer will often coat the ''furniture'' and ''slugs'' (wood and metal spacers) between the columns and around the type. To keep this ink from touching the target sheet, the frisket covers the area that is not desired to print. The frisket is set in a frame, often hinged to the [[tympan]] that holds the paper in place.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Typography 1871"&gt;{{cite book|last=Southward|first=John|authorlink=John Southward|title=A Dictionary of Typography and Its Accessory Arts|year=1871|publisher=Joseph M. Powell|location=London|pages=22|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftypo00sout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new frisket has to be cut for each different page or form; a well-made frisket lasts for hundreds or thousands of impressions.

==Airbrushing==
In [[airbrushing]], a frisket is a plastic sheet with an adhesive backing used to [[Masking (in art)|mask off]] specific areas of an image so that only the exposed area is covered with paint. The frisket is vital to airbrushing, because it allows the artist to control excess paint spray, create special effects, achieve extreme precision, control edge attributes and to expedite the airbrushing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Things To Know When Choosing An Airbrush Compressor|url=http://spraygunner.com/blog/five-things-to-know-when-choosing-an-airbrush-compressor-/|publisher=www.spraygunner.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frisket differs from other masks in that it is a single sheet that covers the entire work, parts of which are removed by cutting into the sheet. Friskets are available in matté and glossy finishes. Some friskets are also [[solvent]]-proof, manufactured for use with solvent-reduced and -based [[Polyurethane#Uses|Urethanes]].

The frisket is fixed to the painting surface and then the appropriate shapes are cut out of the material using a razor or scalpel. The cut piece is lifted, the exposed area painted, and the process repeated using the cut pieces to mask their matching finished areas. When all painting is finished, the resulting work contains precise shapes with no overspray.

==Watercolour==
In [[Watercolor painting|Watercolouring]], frisket, also sometimes called masking fluid, is a removable liquid masking fluid based on latex and ammonia, often available in various colours to make its presence more obvious, which is applied to the surface in order to mask off the areas that are not to be coloured by a given application of paint. Frisket is usually used when the unmasked areas are desired to be the same colour and a rapid wash is being applied, or for negative painting effects.

Watercolouring frisket is applied using a brush, allowed to dry, and then the watercolour paints are applied and also allowed to dry. Once the paper is completely dry, the frisket can be easily removed by gentle rubbing with a natural [[crepe rubber]] pickup - the same as those used for removal of rubber cement. It is important that the paper be completely dry before removing the frisket as the friction can otherwise damage the paper if still damp.

A subsequent application of frisket can be applied to mask other areas - usually those with the intention of applying a different colour or to darken some areas whilst not affecting others - and removed with the natural rubber pickup. This process can be repeated several times without damaging artist grade watercolour papers, so long as the paper is completely dry after each application of watercolours. Some lesser grades of paper often used for practice and academic purposes, may be more prone to damage after repeated masking and painting cycles however. Note also that whilst watercolour frisket can be removed by rubbing with the fingers, doing so has the disadvantage of potentially transferring skin oils which can discolour the artwork, or otherwise affect subsequent applications of watercolours or other mediums such as chalk, ink, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1372">'''General Amusement Corporation''' (GAC) was an international [[Talent agent|talent booking agency]] that was acquired by [[ICM Partners]] in 1974. In the 1940s, GAC's name was changed to '''General Artists Corporation''' to avoid confusion with a registered coin-machine company. General Artists Corporation, through a series of acquisitions and mergers, evolved first into a larger agency called Creative Management Associates, and then, in 1974, into ICM Partners.

GAC was founded in the early 1930s as a partnership between Thomas G. Rockwell (–1958) and Francis "Cork" O'Keefe (1900–1990). It was called the Rockwell-O'Keefe Theatrical Agency. Their clients, then, included [[Bing Crosby]] and the newly formed [[Dorsey Brothers]] band.  In 1939, when O'Keefe retired, Rockwell reorganized the firm and changed the name to General Amusement Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"T.G.

The '''Hackney Flashers''' were a collective of broadly [[socialist]]-[[feminist]] [[women]] who produced notable [[agitprop]] [[exhibition]]s in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Perspectives on Photography'' (1979). Catalogue of Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition at the Hayward Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; Working in the United Kingdom during [[second wave feminism]] (1960s–1980s), the Hackney Flashers are an example of collectives prevalent in the latter half of the 20th century that worked to raise consciousness of social or political issues relevant to the times. This group's original aim was to make visible the invisible and document women's work in the home and outside of it, helping to make the case for childcare and show the complex social and economic issues of women and childcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney Flashers Collective|title=Who's Holding the Baby|journal=Heresies #9|date=1980|volume=3|issue=1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
The group's origins go back to 1974 when photographers [[Jo Spence]] and Neil Martinson were searching for women photographers to produce an exhibition on Women and Work for Hackney Trades Council.&lt;ref&gt;''Putting Myself in the Picture'' (1986), Jo Spence, Camden Press; London, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; A woman designer and an illustrator, a writer and an editor also joined the group. Members were engaged in a variety of occupations at a professional level: university teaching, community photography, freelance photojournalism and publishing; some were active trade unionists. In 1975 the collective was consolidated when it adopted the name Hackney Flashers.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Left Shift: Radical Art in 1970s Britain'', Walker, John A. (London and New York: I .B. Tauris, 2002), p. 138, and "Who's Still Holding the Camera" Liz Heron in ''Putting Myself in the Picture'' (1986), Jo Spence, Camden Press; London, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
From the start the Flashers’ output was distributed as the work of a collective. It was a political decision that individual names were never listed, specific images or writing never credited. This may have led to later confusion about who was in the Hackney Flashers and who worked on the different projects.

Members were: An Dekker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ash|first1=Juliet|title=An Dekker Obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/an-dekker-obituary|website=the Guardian (UK)|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Greenhill, Gerda Jager, Liz Heron, Michael Ann Mullen, Maggie Murray, [[Christine Roche]], [[Jo Spence]] and Julia Vellacott. In her history of ''Women Photographers in Britain'' [[Val Williams]] recounts that "the group's nine women members began to study the use of photography within the capitalist system and to present alternatives. They played a decisive part in establishing a context within which women workers from different cultural fields could work together in pursuit of a collective political aim".&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Observers: Women Photographers in Britain 1900 to the present'', Williams, Val (London: Virago Press, 1986), pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others associated with the group were: Helen Grace, Maggie Millman, Jini Rawlings, Ruth Barrenbaum, Nanette Salomon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who's Holding the Baby?|journal=Heresies|date=1980|volume=4|issue=1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlene Strasberg, Chris Treweek. Neil Martinson was a founding member of the group and was the main point of contact between the group and Hackney Trades Council. He left the group in November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who's Holding the Baby?|journal=Heresies|date=1980|volume=4|issue=1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Dennett did not join the group, but came to one or two meetings as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Spence, Oral History of British Photography, The British Library sound recordings archive, recording Recording date: 1991.03; 1991.04 Wembley, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social purpose==
The group’s purpose and politics grew and developed over time – not without internal conflict and dissent. Members came from differing class backgrounds and political stances. Some were of the left, others emerging feminists. The group's feminist practice was reflected in their tactics of working as a small group outside of institutions like academia. They worked on bringing personal and domestic issues into the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Woman's Estate'', Juliet Mitchell, Penguin Books, 1971, p. 59. and ''Spare Rib'' (1972–93)&lt;/ref&gt; They would meet in each other's homes.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Spence, Oral History of British Photography, The British Library sound recordings archive, recording Recording date: 1991.03; 1991.04 Wembley, London&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic of the group is documented in Liz Heron’s article, "Who’s still holding the camera?" in ''Photography Politics:One''.&lt;ref&gt;"Who’s still holding the camera?" (1979) Liz Heron. In ''Photography Politics: One''. Photography Workshop; London; republished as ‘Quién se ocupa de la cámara?’  in ''Fotografía y activismo'' (2006), ed. Jorge Luis Marzo, Editorial Gustavo Gili, Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of the group was to uncover what was hidden (hence ‘Flashers’). This was true of the many images of women at work (rarely recorded at the time) in the first exhibition and the complications of juggling childcare and work in the second. The works were conceived as campaigning and educational.

The second exhibition also engaged with issues of representation, of subverting imagery and the difficulty of visually showing a lack. Val Williams notes that "The eclectic use of graphics, of cartooning and of advertisements began a process which took photography out of its traditional limits and re-established it as a medium of cohesive political propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Observers: Women Photographers in Britain 1900 to the present'', Williams, Val, (London: Virago Press, 1986), p174.&lt;/ref&gt; Both exhibitions were intended for use in community centres, schools, trades union gatherings and every sort of alternative venue. The panels appeared in town halls, health centres, at conferences, in libraries &lt;ref&gt;''Transmitter Receiver: The Persistence of Collage'', An Arts Council Collection exhibition, Caroline Douglas and Jill Constantine, Hayward Publishing (London, 2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Hayward Gallery]] when it was selected by curator John Tagg to be included in the 'Three Perspectives of Photography' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;''Left Shift: Radical Art in 1970s Britain'', Walker, John A. (London and New York: I .B. Tauris, 2002), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;
The collective also functioned as a co-operative, skill-sharing experience for women working in the media, who at that time had a very low profile and were often isolated.

==The work==
The Hackney Flashers Collective produced three main pieces of work, although there were other experimental pieces, including montages, which were made in the group’s occasional creative workshops

*''Women and Work'' (1975). This exhibit of B/W photographs and hand-written text acknowledged the hidden contribution women made to the economy and was a strong statement for equal pay. It was basic in concept and execution, but was well received and much used. It started its public life in Hackney Town Hall,&lt;ref&gt;''75 Years of Brotherhood: 1900–1975 Trades Union Exhibition'', Hackney Town Hall, 20 Sept-2 Oct
Pamphlet published by Hackney Trades Council (1975). Foreword by Terry McCarthy, Curator, National Museum of Labour History&lt;/ref&gt; appeared at a Socialist Feminist International Conference in Paris (1977) &lt;ref&gt;"Who’s still holding the camera?" (1979) Liz Heron. In Photography Politics: One Photography Workshop; London; republished as "Quién se ocupa de la cámara?" in Fotografía y activismo (2006), ed. Jorge Luis Marzo, Editorial Gustavo Gili, Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; and was hung in many venues in between.

[[File:Panel from 'Who'se Holding the Baby?' exhibition, 1978 by the Hackney Flashers Collective, showing the use of photomontage and graffiti by the group.jpg|thumb|right|Panel from ''Who’s Holding the Baby?'' exhibition by The Hackney Flashers Collective, 1978]]

* ''Who’s Holding the Baby'' (1978) The second exhibition was more sophisticated in its thinking and style. A designer and an illustrator had joined the group; the collective experimented at workshops and studied the work of [[John Heartfield]] when producing montages. These were used alongside a series of photographs documenting Market Nursery in Hackney. The lightweight, laminated panels were ideal for use in non-gallery settings and, as well as the photographs, included colour illustrations and montages. Its first showing was at Centreprise Community Centre in [[Kingsland Road]], Hackney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Observers: Women Photographers in Britain 1900 to the present'', Williams, Val (London: Virago Press, 1986), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; It toured to many parts of the country and was, controversially, included in, ‘Three Perspectives on Photography’, at the Hayward Gallery in 1979 &lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "Three Perspectives on Photography" (1979). In ''Screen Education'' 1979:31, pp. 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afterlife and influence==
The collective split up in the early 80s citing political differences and the wish to work on other projects. Members of the Collective continued to develop their own careers or engage in new fields. Sally Greenhill worked as a photojournalist, Liz Heron worked as a journalist and literary translator and is the author of fiction and non-fiction books; Michael Ann Mullen became Photography Officer at the GLC and later lectured in history of photography at [[Middlesex University]]; Maggie Murray (with Val Wilmer) set up Format Photographers – a women's photo agency; Christine Roche continued as a cartoonist/illustrator and taught at the [[London College of Printing]]; Jo Spence produced books and exhibitions on health and representation. She died in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Jo (ed.), Spence, Jo, ''Cultural Sniping: The Art of Transgression'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Vellacott was an editor at [[Penguin Books]]. 
Informal contact and collaboration between many of the Flashers went on for many years and continues.

The work of the Hackney Flashers has been noted in histories of photography &lt;ref&gt;"Surveyors and Surveyed", Price, Derrick, in Wells, Liz (ed.), ''Photography: A Critical Introduction'' (London and New York: Routledge, 2004, Third Edition), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the art practices of collage and montage.&lt;ref&gt;''Transmitter Receiver: The Persistence of Collage'', Caroline Douglas and Jill Constantine (2011), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the initial showing of the work, the projects by the Hackney Flashers have been included in several major exhibitions in recent years. These have included but are not limited to:

'''2000:''' ''Protest and Survive'' at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]], curated by artists Matthew Higgs and Paul Noble &lt;ref&gt;''Protest and Survive'' exhibition catalogue, Matthew Higgs and Paul Noble (Whitechapel Art Gallery, 2000), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hispanism''' (sometimes referred to as '''[[Hispanic]] Studies''' or '''Spanish Studies''') is the study of the literature and culture of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking world, principally that of [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]]. It can also entail studying Spanish language and culture in the [[United States]] and in other presently or formerly Spanish-speaking countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Pacific]], such as [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the [[Philippines]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A practicing scholar who specializes in this field is known as a [[Hispanist]].

==Origins==
During the 16th century, Spain was a motor of innovation in Europe, given its links to new lands, subjects, literary sorts and personages, dances, and fashions. This hegemonic status, also advanced by commercial and economic interests, generated interest in learning the Spanish language, as Spain was the dominant political power and was the first to develop an overseas empire in post-[[Renaissance]] Europe. In order to respond to that interest, some Spanish writers developed a new focus on the Spanish language as subject matter. In 1492 [[Antonio de Nebrija]] published his ''Gramática castellana'', the first published grammar of a modern European language. [[Juan de Valdés]] composed his [https://books.google.com/books?id=lOoRAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Diálogo de la lengua''] (1533) for his Italian friends, who were eager to learn Castilian. And the lawyer [[:es:Cristóbal de Villalón|Cristóbal de Villalón]] wrote in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ud07AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT4&amp;dq=Villal%C3%B3n+Gram%C3%A1tica+castellana&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kUbyTYGIBKSn0AGB3_3_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Gramática castellana''] (Antwerp, 1558) that Castilian was spoken by Flemish, Italian, English, and French persons.

For many years, especially between 1550 and 1670, European presses published a large number of Spanish grammars and dictionaries that linked Spanish to one or more other languages. Two of the oldest grammars were published anonymously in [[Leuven|Louvain]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y02ycQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Util+y+breve+institucion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N1DyTf-cOcXt0gHz_aDBCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA ''Útil y breve institución para aprender los Principios y fundamentos de la lengua Hespañola''] (1555) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=O1ddAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=gramatica+de+la+lengua+vulgar+de+espa%C3%B1a&amp;dq=gramatica+de+la+lengua+vulgar+de+espa%C3%B1a&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7lHyTdLLM-fx0gH_0LWKDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ ''Gramática de la lengua vulgar de España''] (1559).

Among the more outstanding foreign authors of Spanish grammars were the Italians [[Giovanni Mario Alessandri]] (1560) and [[Giovanni Miranda]] (1566);&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Il paragone della lingva toscana et castigliana|author=Alessandri, G.M.|date=1560|publisher=Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-AgGwAACAAJ|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the English [[Richard Percivale]] (1591),&lt;ref name="percivale+minsheu"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Spanish Grammar...: Now Augmented and Increased...

Elzevier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XATAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dictionaries were composed by the Italian [[Girolamo Vittori]] (1602), the Englishman [[:es:John Torius|John Torius]] (1590) and the Frenchmen [[:es:Jacques Ledel|Jacques Ledel]] (1565), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KQnfTw_oT6UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jean+Palet&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FkP1TZeGKqL10gGsy4iMAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] [[:es:Jean Palet|Jean Palet]] (1604) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=eEd8QwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Fran%C3%A7ois+Huillery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9UP1TYGiF4jL0QGy-8nsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA] [[:es:François Huillery|François Huillery]] (1661). The lexicographical contribution of the German [[Heinrich Hornkens]] (1599) and of the Franco-Spanish author [[:es:Pere Lacavallería|Pere Lacavallería]] (1642) were also important to French Hispanism.

Others combined grammars and dictionaries. The works of the Englishman [[Richard Percivale]] (1591), Frenchman [[César Oudin]] (1597, 1607), Italians [[Lorenzo Franciosini]] (1620, 1624) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=LZMCAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Arnaldo+de+la+Porte&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b0X1Ta-vJZOn0AGFlrHpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false [[:es:Arnaldo de la Porte|Arnaldo de la Porte]]] (1659, 1669) and Austrian [https://books.google.com/books?id=LYu2sj0spQ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nicholas+Mez+von+Braidenbach&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D0f1TYPMM-qv0AH4rtjsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false [[:es:Nicholas Mez von Braidenbach|Nicholas Mez von Braidenbach]]] (1666, 1670) were especially relevant. Franciosini and Oudin also translated ''[[Don Quixote]]''. This list is far from complete and the grammars and dictionaries in general had a great number of versions, adaptations, reprintings and even translations (Oudin's ''Grammaire et observations de langue espagnolle'', for example, was translated into Latin and English). This is why it is not possible to exaggerate the great impact that the Spanish language had in the Europe of the 16th and 17th centuries.

In the 19th century, coinciding with the loss of the Spanish colonial empire and the birth of new Latin American republics, Europe and the United States showed a renewed interest in Hispanic history, literature and culture of the declining great power and its now independent former colonies.

During [[Romanticism|the Romantic period]], the image of a Moorish and exotic medieval Spain, a picturesque country with a mixed cultural heritage, captured the imagination of many writers. This led many to become interested in Spanish literature, legends, and traditions. Travel books written at that time maintained and intensified that interest, and led to a more serious and scientific approach to the study of Spanish and Hispanic American culture. This field did not have a word coined to name it until the early 20th century, when it ended up being called Hispanism.

Hispanism has traditionally been defined{{by whom|date=September 2012}} as the study of the Spanish and Spanish-American cultures, and particularly of their language by foreigners or people generally not educated in Spain. The [[Cervantes Institute]] has promoted the study of Spanish and Hispanic culture around the world, similar to the way in which institutions such as the [[British Council]], the [[Alliance Française]] or the [[Goethe Institute]] have done for their own countries.

==Hispanism in the world==

===Hispanism in Great Britain and Ireland===
The first Spanish book translated into English was the ''[[La Celestina|Celestina]]'', as an adaptation in verse published in London between 1525 and 1530 by [[John Rastell]]. It includes only the first four acts and is based on the Italian version of Alfonso de Ordóñez; it is often referred to as an ''Interlude'', and its original title is ''A New Comedy in English in Manner of an Interlude Right Elegant and Full of Craft of Rhetoric: Wherein is Shewed and Described as well the Beauty and Good Properties of Women, as Their Vices and Evil Conditions with a Moral Conclusion and Exhortation to Virtue.''. The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden|William Drummond]] (1585–1649) translated [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] and [[Juan Boscán]]. The English knew the masterpieces of Castilian literature, from early translations of ''[[Amadís de Gaula]]'' by [[Garci Rodriguez de Montalvo]] and the ''[[Cárcel de amor]]'' by [[Diego de San Pedro]]. Sir [[Philip Sidney]] had read ''[[Siete libros de la Diana]]'' by the Hispano-Portuguese [[Jorge de Montemayor]], whose poetry influenced him greatly. John Bourchier translated ''Libro de Marco Aurelio'' by [[Antonio de Guevara]]. [[:es:David Rowland|David Rowland]] translated ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' in 1586, which may have inspired the first English [[picaresque novel]], ''The Unfortunate Traveller'' (1594), by [[Thomas Nashe]]. By the end of the 16th century, the ''Celestina'' had been translated fully (in London, J. Wolf, 1591; [[Adam Islip]], 1596; [[William Apsley]], 1598; and others). Some of the translators of that time traveled or lived for some time in Spain, such as Lord Berners, [[:es:Bartholomew Yong|Bartholomew Yong]], [[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]], [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] and [[James Mabbe]]. [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] (Lord Burghley; 1520–1598) owned the largest Spanish library in the United Kingdom.

Elizabethan theater also felt the powerful influence of the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], a frequent collaborator of [[Shakespeare]], borrowed from [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'' for his ''[[Cardenio]]'', possibly written in collaboration with Shakespeare, who is thought to have read [[Juan Luis Vives]]. Fletcher's frequent collaborator [[Francis Beaumont]] also imitated [[Don Quixote]] in the more well-known ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]''. Fletcher also borrowed from Cervantes's ''Los trabajos de Persiles y Segismunda'' for his [[The Custom of the Country (play)|''The Custom of the Country'']] and from Cervantes's ''La ilustre fregona'' for his beautiful young saleswoman. [[Thomas Middleton]] and [[William Rowley]] were inspired by Cervantes's ''La gitanilla'' (one of his ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'') to write ''[[The Spanish Gipsy]]'' (1623).

The first translation of ''Don Quixote'' into a foreign language was the English version by [[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]] (first part, 1612; second, 1620). And ''Don Quixote'' was imitated in the satirical poem ''Hudibras'' (1663–78), composed by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]. In addition, the works of some great Golden Age poets were translated into English by [[Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet|Richard Fanshawe]], who died in Madrid. As early as 1738, a luxurious London edition of ''Don Quixote'' in Spanish was published, prepared by the [[Sephardic]] Cervantist [[:es:Pedro Pineda|Pedro Pineda]], with an introduction by [[:es:Gregorio Mayans|Gregorio Mayans]] and ornate engravings. Also in the 18th century two new translations of ''Don Quixote'' were published, one by the painter [[Charles Jervas]] (1742) and one by [[Tobias Smollett]], a writer of [[picaresque novel]]s (1755). Smollet appears as an avid reader of Spanish narrative, and that influence is always present in his works. Meanwhile, the best work of the 17th-century writer [[Charlotte Lennox]] is ''[[The Female Quixote]]'' (1752), which was inspired by Cervantes. Cervantes also was the inspiration for ''The Spiritual Quixote'', by [[Richard Graves]]. Thwe first critical and annotated edition of ''Don Quixote'' was that of the English clergyman [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] (1781). The novelists [[Henry Fielding]] and [[Lawrence Sterne]] also were familiar with the works of Cervantes.

Among the British travellers in Spain in the 18th century who left written testimony of their travels are (chronologically) [[John Durant Breval]], [[Thomas James]], [[Wyndham Beawes]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[Richard Twiss (writer)|Richard Twiss]], [[Francis Carter (writer)|Francis Carter]], [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]], [[Philip Thicknesse]], [[Henry Swinburne]], [[John Talbot Dillon]], [[Alexander Jardine (British Army officer)|Alexander Jardine]], [[Richard Croker]], [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], [[Joseph Townsend]], [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]], [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], John Macdonald ([https://books.google.com/books?id=A5ky1nzR2nUC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Memoirs+of+an+eighteenth-century+footman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lOTxT_GJJ4fb6wGGyZWYBg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Memoirs%20of%20an%20eighteenth-century%20footman&amp;f=false ''Memoirs of an Eighteenth-Century Footman]), [[Robert Southey]] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=S5c-YgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Neville+Wyndham&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QAH9TdXXJeqt0AGs-N3GAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ Neville Wyndham].

Other English travel writers who straddled the 18th and 19th centuries include [[John Hookham Frere]], [[Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Henry Richard Vassall-Fox]], better known as Lord Holland (1773–1840), a great friend of [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] and [[Manuel José Quintana]], and benefactor of [[José María Blanco White]]. Lord Holland visited Spain on numerous occasions and wrote his impressions about those trips. He also collected books and manuscripts and wrote a biography of [[Lope de Vega]]. His home was open to all Spaniards, but especially to the liberal émigrés who arrived in the London district of [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] in the 19th century, fleeing the absolutist repression of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] and the religious and ideological dogmatism of the country. Many of them subsisted by translating or teaching their language to English people, most of whom were interested in conducting business with Spanish America, although others wished to learn about  Spanish medieval literature, much in vogue among the Romantics. One of the émigrés, [[:es:Antonio Alcalá Galiano|Antonio Alcalá Galiano]], taught Spanish literature as a professor at the University of London in 1828 and published his notes. The publisher [[:es:Rudolph Ackerman|Rudolph Ackerman]] established a great business publishing ''Catecismos'' (text books) on different matters in Spanish, many of them written by Spanish émigrés, for the new Spanish-American republics. [[:es:Matthew G. Lewis|Matthew G. Lewis]] set some of his works in Spain. And the protagonist of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''Abbey of Northanger'' is deranged by her excessive reading of [[Gothic novel]]s, much as was Don Quixote with his books of [[Knight-errant|chivalry]].

Sir [[Walter Scott]] was an enthusiastic reader of Cervantes and tried his hand at translation. He dedicated his narrative poem ''The Vision of Roderick'' (1811) to Spain and its history. [[Thomas Rodd]] translated some [[Romancero|Spanish folk ballads]]. [[Lord Byron]] also was greatly interested in Spain and was a reader of ''Don Quixote''. He translated the ballad ''Ay de mi Alhama'' in part of his ''Childe Harold'' and ''Don Juan''. [[Richard Chenevix Trench|Richard Trench]] translated [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] and was friends with some of the emigrated Spaniards, some of whom wrote in both English and Spanish, such as [[José María Blanco White]] and [[:es:Telesforo de Trueba y Cossío|Telesforo de Trueba y Cossío]], and many of whom (including [[Juan Calderón]], who held a chair of Spanish at [[King's College London|King's College]]), spread knowledge of the Spanish language and its literature. [[John Hookham Frere]] was a friend of the [[:es:Ángel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas|Duke of Rivas]] when the latter was in Malta, and Hookham translated some medieval and classical poetry into English. The brothers [[Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen]] and [[Benjamin B. Wiffen]] were both scholars of Spanish culture. The [[Lake Poets|"Lake Poet"]] [[Robert Southey]], translated ''[[Amadís de Gaula]]'' and ''[[:es:Palmerín de Inglaterra|Palmerín de Inglaterra]]'' into English, among others works. English novelists were strongly influenced by Cervantes. Especially so was [[Charles Dickens]], who created a quixotic pair in Mr. Pickwick and [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] of ''Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club''. [[John Ormsby (translator)|John Ormsby]] translated the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' and ''[[Don Quixote]]''. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] left traces of his devotion to [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] in his work. The polyglot [[John Bowring]] traveled to Spain in 1819 and published the observations of his trip. Other accounts of travel in Spain include those of [[Richard Ford]], whose ''Handbook for  Travellers in Spain'' (1845) was republished in many editions, and [[George Borrow]], author of the travelogue ''[[The Bible in Spain]]'', which was translated into Castilian by [[Manuel Azaña]], the poet and translator [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]], and the literary historian [[James Fitzmaurice-Kelly]], who was mentor to a whole British generation of Spanish scholars such as [[Edgar Allison Peers]] and [[:es:Alexander A. Parker|Alexander A. Parker]]. Other outstanding Hispanists include the following:
*[[:es:Frank Pierce|Francis William Pierce]], Irish student of the epic poetry of the Golden Age;
*[[John Brande Trend]], a historian of Spanish music;
*[[:es:Edward Meryon Wilson|Edward Meryon Wilson]], who translated the ''Soledades'' of [[Luis de Góngora]] (1931);

The [http://www.hispanists.org.uk/ Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland] (AHGBI) was founded in 1955 by a group of university professors at [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]], and since then it has held congresses annually. The AHGBI played a decisive role in the creation of the [http://asociacioninternacionaldehispanistas.org/ [[:es:Asociación Internacional de Hispanistas|Asociación Internacional de Hispanistas]]] (AIH), whose first congress was held at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1962.

===Hispanism in Germany, Austria and Switzerland===
Aside from the imitation of the [[picaresque novel]] by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen]], Hispanism bloomed in Germany around the enthusiasm that German Romantics had for [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]], and [[Baltasar Gracián|Gracián]]. [[Friedrich Diez]] (1794–1876) can be considered the first German philologist to give prominence to Spanish, in his ''Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen'' (1836–1843) and his ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der romanischen Sprachen'' (1854). His first Spanish-related work, ''Altspanische Romanzen'', was published in 1819.

Important to the promotion of Hispanism in Germany was a group of Romantic writers that included [[Ludwig Tieck]], an orientalist and poet who translated ''[[Don Quixote]]'' into German (1799–1801); [[Friedrich Bouterwek]], author of the unorthodox ''Geschichte der Poesie und Beredsamkeit seit dem Ende des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' and translator of Cervantes's short farce ''El Juez de los Divorcios''; and [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767–1845), who translated works of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] (''Spanisches Theater'', 1803–1809) and Spanish classical poetry into German. The philologist and folklorist [[Jakob Grimm]] published ''Silva de romances viejos'' (Vienna, 1816) with a prologue in Spanish. [[Juan Nicolás Böhl de Faber]], German consul in Spain, was a devoted student of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]], of Spanish classical theater generally, and of traditional popular literature. The philologist [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] traveled through Spain taking notes and was interested especially in the Basque language, and the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was an avid reader and translator of [[Baltasar Gracián|Gracián]]. Count [[Adolf Friedrich von Schack]] (1815–1894) made a trip to Spain in 1852 to study the remnants of the Moorish civilization and became a devoted scholar of things Spanish.

Hispanists of German, Austrian, and Swiss origins include [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Wendelin Förster]], [[Karl Vollmöller]], [[:es:Adolf Tobler|Adolf Tobler]], [[:es:Heinrich Morf|Heinrich Morf]], [[Gustav Gröber]], [[:es:Gottfried Baist|Gottfried Baist]], and [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]]. Among them are two emigrants to Chile, [[:es:Rodolfo Lenz|Rodolfo Lenz]]
(1863–1938), whose works include his [https://books.google.com/books?id=IJoMAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rodolfo+lenz+voces+chilenas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7M8ATrC8KIS2tgf4tszyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Diccionario etimolójico de las voces chilenas derivadas de lenguas indíjenas americanas''] (1904) and ''Chilenische Studien'' (1891), as well as other works on grammar and the Spanish of the Americas; and [[:es:Friedrich Hanssen|Friedrich Hanssen]] (1857–1919), author of ''Spanische Grammatik auf historischer Grundlage'' (1910; revised ed. in Spanish, ''Gramática histórica de la lengua castellana'', 1913), as well as other works on [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] philology, [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] dialectology, and the Spanish of the Americas. The ''Handbuch der romanischen Philologie'' (1896) by [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]] was a classic in Spain, as were his ''Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen'' (1890–1902), ''Einführung in das Studium der romanischen Sprachwissenschaft'' (1901) (translated into Spanish), and ''Romanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'' (1935). [[Johannes Fastenrath]], through his translations and other works, spread the Spanish culture among his contemporaries; in
addition, he created the [[:es:Premio Fastenrath|prize]] that bears his name in the [[Real Academia Española|Spanish Royal Academy]], to reward the best works in Spanish poetry, fiction, and essays. The Austrian Romance scholar [[:es:Ferdinand Wolf|Ferdinand Wolf]], a friend of [[Agustín Durán]], was particularly interested in the [[romancero]], in the lyric poetry of the medieval Spanish [[:es:Lírica cancioneril|''cancioneros'']], and in other medieval folk poetry; he also studied Spanish authors who had resided in Vienna, such as [[Cristóbal de Castillejo]]. The Swiss scholar [[:es:Heinrich Morf|Heinrich Morf]] edited the medieval [[:es:Poema de Yuçuf|''Poema de José'']] (Leipzig, 1883). The works of [[Karl Vossler]] and [[:es:Ludwig Pfandl|Ludwig Pfandl]] on linguistic idealism and literary stylistics were widely read in Spain. [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] studies in Germany were advanced by the editions of [[:es:Max Krenkel|Max Krenkel]]. Other important authors were [[Emil Gessner]], who wrote [https://books.google.com/books?id=JgOpQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Emil+Gessner+altleonesische&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xtMATpaHIIO4tgfmo9GoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA ''Das Altleonesische''] (Old Leonese) (Berlin 1867); [[:es:Gottfried Baist|Gottfried Baist]], who produced an edition of [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Don Juan Manuel]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=HccGAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=baist+juan+manuel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Asj_TZz6I4y3twfK7YjMDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Libro de la caza''] (1880), as well as the outline of a historical grammar of Spanish, ''Die spanische Sprache'', in the encyclopedia of Romance philology published by [[:es:Gustav Gröber|Gustav Gröber]] in 1888; [[Hugo Schuchardt]], known for his study of Spanish [[flamenco]] music, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xPh8QwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Die+cantes+flamencos+Schuchardt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T9cATrKMGpO5twfOvqn-DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK ''Die cantes flamencos'']; and [[Armin Gassner]], who wrote [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Armin+Gassner+altspanische+verbum&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vbgATqO1BMaztwes6f3zDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Das altspanische Verbum''] (the Old Spanish verb) (1897), as well as a work on Spanish syntax (1890) and several articles on Spanish pronouns between 1893 and 1895. And [[Moritz Goldschmidt]] wrote [https://books.google.com/books?id=BccAAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Goldschmidt:+Zur+Kritik+der+altgermanischen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k8wATu-dJ4uatwe06sWMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Zur Kritik der altgermanischen Elemente im Spanischen''] (Bonn 1887), the first work on the influences of the Germanic languages on Spanish.

[[:es:Fritz Krüger|Fritz Krüger]] created the famous "Hamburg School" (not to be confused with the [[Hamburger Schule|pop music genre]] of the 1980s, of the same name), which applied the principles of the ''[[Wörter und Sachen]]'' movement, founded earlier by Swiss and German philologists such as [[Hugo Schuchardt]], Ruduolf Meringer, and [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]], aptly combining dialectology and ethnography. Between 1926 and 1944 Krüger directed the journal ''Volkstum und Kultur der Romane'' and its supplements (1930–1945). It totaled 37 volumes, in which many of his students published their works. Krüger wrote mainly on Hispanic dialectology, especially on that of western Spain (Extremadura and Leon) and the Pyrenees, and he traveled on foot to gather the materials for his monumental work [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Die+Hochpyrenaen+Kr%C3%BCger&amp;btnG=Search+Books#hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cVUCTvOzAZTTgQf0lenpDQ&amp;ved=0CCkQBSgA&amp;q=Die+Hochpyren%C3%A4en+Kr%C3%BCger&amp;spell=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=6455a52e8f48720&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=605 ''Die Hochpyrenäen''], in which he meticulously described the landscape, flora, fauna, material culture, popular traditions and dialects of the Central Pyrenees. The versatile Romance scholar [[:es:Gerhard Rohlfs|Gerhard Rohlfs]] investigated the languages and the dialects of both sides of the Pyrenees and their elements in common, as well as pre-Roman substrate languages of the Iberian Peninsula and [[Guanche language|Guanche]] [[loanwords]].

The works of [[Karl Vossler]], founder of the linguistic school of [[idealism]], include  interpretations of Spanish literature and reflections on the Spanish culture. Vossler, along with [[:es:Helmut Hatzfeld|Helmut Hatzfeld]] and [[Leo Spitzer]], began a new school of stylistics based on aesthetics, which focused on the means of expression of various authors.

The early twentieth century marked the founding of two German institutions dedicated to Hispanic Studies (including Catalan, Galician and the Portuguese), in Hamburg and Berlin respectively. The University of Hamburg's Iberoamerikanisches Forschungsinstitut (Ibero-American Research Institute) was, from its founding in 1919 until the 1960s, almost the only German university institution dedicated to Spanish and other languages of the Iberian Peninsula. The Institute published the journal ''Volkstum und Kultur der Romanen'' (1926–1944), devoted specifically to works on dialectology and popular culture, following, in general, patterns of the ''[[Wörter und Sachen]]'' school. Meanwhile, Berlin's [http://www.iai.spk-berlin.de/ Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut] was founded in 1930. Today, the Berlin institute houses Europe's largest library dedicated to studies of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America, and to the languages of these countries (including Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Basque, and the indigenous languages of the Americas). The Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin is engaged in research in the fields of literature, linguistics, ethnology, history, and art history.

Under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] (1933–1945), German philology went through a difficult time. Some Romanists, through their work, praised and propagated the Nazi ideology. Meanwhile, others lost their professorships or underwent anti-Jewish persecution (such as [[Yakov Malkiel]] and [[Leo Spitzer]], both of whom emigrated), by falling into disfavor with the regime or actively opposing it (for example [[:es:Helmut Hatzfeld|Helmut Hatzfeld]], who fled from Germany, and Werner Krauss (not to be confused with the [[Werner Krauss|actor]] of the same name), who lost his academic position in 1935).

Laboriously reconstructed after World War II, the Hispanic philology of the German-speaking countries contributed the works of [[Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos]] and [[Ernst Robert Curtius]]. Also:

* [[:de:Rudolph Grossmann|Rudolph Grossmann]] produced a Spanish-German dictionary and an anthology of Spanish lyric poetry.
* [[:es:Hans Juretschke|Hans Juretschke]] contributed studies on [https://books.google.com/books?id=FYhQYgEACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Hans+Juretschke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XX0DTpKKOcbl0QHW_ZDvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ Spanish Romanticism] and on [https://books.google.com/books?id=rDsttwAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Hans+Juretschke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XX0DTpKKOcbl0QHW_ZDvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA German culture in Spain].
* [[:de:Werner Beinhauer|Werner Beinhauer]] wrote several books on colloquial Spanish.
* Torsten Rox studied [[Mariano José de Larra]] and the Spanish nineteenth-century media.
* [[:de:Hans Magnus Enzensberger|Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] published a new translation of [[Federico García Lorca]].

The [http://www.hispanistica.de/ Deutscher Hispanistenverband] ([[:es:Asociación Alemana de Hispanistas|German Association of Hispanists]]) was established in 1977 and since then has held a congress biennially. Currently in Germany, Spanish often surpasses French in number of students. About forty university departments of Romance philology exist in Germany, and there are more than ten thousand students of Spanish.

Today in Germany there are publishers specialized in Hispanic Studies, such as [http://www.reichenberger.de/ Edition Reichenberger], in [[Kassel]], which is

devoted to the Golden Age, and Klaus Dieter Vervuert's [http://www.iberoamericanalibros.com/en/ Iberoamericana Vervuert Verlag], which has branches in Frankfurt and Madrid and facilitates collaboration among Hispanists.

In Austria, [[Franz Grillparzer]] was the first scholar of Spanish and a reader of the theater of the Golden Age. Anton Rothbauer also distinguished himself, as a  translator of modern lyric poetry and scholar of the [[Black Legend]]. [[:de:Rudolf Palgen|Rudolf Palgen]] and Alfred Wolfgang Wurzbach (for example with [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLSzSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Alfred+Wolfgang+Wurzbach&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SYgDTtPiOobn0QHTnYmgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg his study] of [[Lope de Vega]]) also contributed to Hispanism in Austria.

===Hispanism in France and Belgium===
Hispanism in France dates back to the powerful influence of [[Spanish Golden Age]] literature on authors such as [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Paul Scarron]]. Spanish influence was also brought to France by Spanish Protestants who fled the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], many of whom took up teaching of the Spanish language. These included [[:es:Juan de Luna|Juan de Luna]], author of a sequel to ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''. N. Charpentier's [https://books.google.com/books?id=8WcocgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Charpentier+Parfaicte+m%C3%A9thode&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c0X2TYr1Eaby0gGbkNnsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw ''Parfaicte méthode pour entendre, écrire et parler la langue espagnole''] (Paris: Lucas Breyel, 1597) was supplemented by the grammar of [[:fr:César Oudin|César Oudin]] (also from 1597) that served as a model to those that were later written in French. [[Michel de Montaigne]] read the chroniclers of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]] and had as one of his models [[Antonio de Guevara]]. [[Molière]], [[Alain-René Lesage]], and [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]] borrowed plots and characters from Spanish literature.

French travelers to Spain in the 19th century who left written and artistic testimony include painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[Henri Regnault]]; well-known authors such as [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[George Sand]], [[Stendhal]], [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]]; and other writers, including [[Jean-François de Bourgoing]], [[Jean Charles Davillier]], [[:fr:Louis Viardot|Louis Viardot]], [[Baron Isidore Justin Séverin Taylor|Isidore Justin Séverin]], [[Charles Didier (writer)|Charles Didier]], [[Alexandre de Laborde]], [[:es:Antoine de Latour|Antoine de Latour]], [[Joseph Bonaventure Laurens]], [[Édouard Magnien]], [[Pierre Louis de Crusy]] and [[Antoine Frédéric Ozanam]].

[[Victor Hugo]] was in Spain accompanying his father in 1811 and 1813. He was proud to call himself a "[[grandee]] of Spain", and he knew the language well. In his works there are numerous allusions to [[El Cid]] and the works of [[Cervantes]].

[[Prosper Mérimée]], even before his repeated trips to Spain, had shaped his intuitive vision of the country in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=I00SMVParGEC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=la+Famille+de+Carvajal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NFb2TcPRLOyx0AGy8qXsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=la%20Famille%20de%20Carvajal&amp;f=false ''Théatre de Clara Gazul''] (1825) and in ''La Famille de Carvajal'' (1828). Mérimée made many trips between 1830 and 1846, making numerous friends, among them the [[Ángel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas|Duke of Rivas]] and [[:es:Antonio Alcalá Galiano|Antonio Alcalá Galiano]]. He wrote ''Lettres addressées d'Espagne au directeur de la Revue de Paris'', which are [[Costumbrismo|''costumbrista'']] sketches that feature the description of a bullfight. Mérimée's short novels ''Les âmes du purgatoire'' (1834) and ''Carmen'' (1845) are classic works on Spain.

[[Honoré de Balzac]] was a friend of [[Francisco Martínez de la Rosa]] and  dedicated his novel ''El Verdugo'' (1829) to him. (And Martínez de la Rosa's play ''Abén Humeya'' was produced in Paris in 1831.)

The Spanish ''[[romancero]]'' is represented in the French [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AA0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Biblioth%C3%A8que+universelle+de+romans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kmj2TdqmBabr0gGi25XuDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Biblioth%C3%A8que%20universelle%20de%20romans&amp;f=false ''Bibliothèque universelle des romans''], which was published in 1774. [[Auguste Creuzé de Lesser]] published [[Romancero|folk ballads]] about [[El Cid]] in 1814, comparing them (as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] had done before him) with the Greek epic tradition, and these were reprinted in 1823 and 1836, providing much raw material to the French Romantic movement. The journalist and publisher [[:fr:Abel Hugo|Abel Hugo]], brother of [[Victor Hugo]], emphasized the literary value of the [[romancero]], translating and publishing a collection of ''romances'' and a history of King Rodrigo in 1821, and ''Romances historiques traduits de l'espagnol'' in 1822. He also composed a stage review, ''Les français en Espagne'' (1823), inspired by the time he spent with his brother at the Seminario de Nobles in Madrid during the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]].

[[Germaine de Staël|Madame de Stäel]] contributed to the knowledge of Spanish Literature in France (as she did also for German literature), which helped introduce Romanticism to the country. To this end she translated volume IV of [[Friedrich Bouterwek]]'s ''Geschichte der Poesie und Beredsamkeit seit dem Ende des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' in 1812 and gave it the title of ''Histoire de la littérature espagnole''.

Spanish literature was also promoted to readers of French by the Swiss author [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi|Simonde de Sismondi]] with his study ''De la littérature du midi de l'Europe'' (1813).

Also important for French access to Spanish poetry was the two-volume [https://books.google.com/books?id=6NUAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=maury+Espagne+po%C3%A9tique&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hKr3TYLzAoKutwfv4qS-Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Espagne poétique''] (1826–27), an anthology of post-15th-century Castilian poetry translated by [[:es:Juan María Maury|Juan María Maury]]. In Paris, the publishing house Baudry published many works by Spanish Romantics and even maintained a collection of "best" Spanish authors, edited by [[Eugenio de Ochoa]].

Images of Spain were offered by the travel books of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] and [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], as well as the poet [[Théophile Gautier]], who travelled in Spain in 1840 and published [https://books.google.com/books?id=7YIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gautier+espagne&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L4r3TdXOLJK-sQPJ5uzFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Voyage en Espagne''] (1845) and ''Espagne'' (1845). These works are so full of color and the sense of the picturesque that they even served as inspirations to Spanish writers themselves (poets such as [[José Zorrilla y Moral|José Zorrilla]] and narrators such as those of the [[Generation of '98]]), as well as to [[Alexandre Dumas]], who attended the production of Zorrilla's ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' in Madrid. Dumas wrote his somewhat negative views of his experience in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wgUAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=dumas%20impressions%20de%20voyage&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks ''Impressions de voyage''] (1847–1848). In his play ''Don Juan de Marana'', Dumas revived the legend of [[Don Juan]], changing the ending after having seen Zorrilla's version in the edition of 1864.

[[François-René de Chateaubriand]] traveled through Iberia in 1807 on his return trip from Jerusalem, and later took part in the [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French intervention in Spain]] in 1823, which he describes in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=VyAQAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chateaubriand+m%C3%A9moires+d%27outre+tombe&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j5r3TdvXL8na0QGqvsDICw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Mémoires d'Outre-tombe''] (1849–1850). It may have been at that time that he began to write ''Les aventures du dernier Abencerraje'' (1826), which exalted Hispano-Arabic chivalry. Another work that was widely read was the [https://books.google.com/books?id=SV87AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lettres+d%27un+espagnol+viardot&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJ33TZiJDYbs0gHj4q2VCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Lettres d'un espagnol''] (1826), by [[:fr:Louis Viardot|Louis Viardot]], who visited Spain in 1823.

[[Stendhal]] included a chapter "De l'Espagne" in his essay ''De l'amour'' (1822). Later (1834) he visited the country.

[[George Sand]] spent the winter of 1837–1838 with [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] in [[Majorca]], installed in the [[Valldemossa Charterhouse]]. Their impressions are captured in Sand's [https://books.google.com/books?id=lBs6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=un+hiver+au+midi+George+Sand&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qrv3TdbYI8nZ0QGLi6HOCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Un hiver au midi de l'Europe''] (1842) and in Chopin's ''Memoirs''.

Spanish classical painting exerted a strong influence on [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and more recently, painters such as [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] have influenced modern painting generally.

Spanish music has influenced composers such as [[Georges Bizet]], [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], [[Édouard Lalo]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Claude Debussy]].

At present the most important centers for Hispanism in France are at the Universities of [[University of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]], and in Paris, with the Institut des Études Hispaniques, founded in 1912. Journals include ''Bulletin Hispanique''.

Prominent Hispanists in Belgium include [[:es:Pierre Groult|Pierre Groult]] and [[:es:Lucien-Paul Thomas|Lucien-Paul Thomas]]. Groult studied [https://books.google.com/books?id=pv4LAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pierre+Groult&amp;dq=Pierre+Groult&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LMT3TYK3DoXZ0QGe1J3VCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ Castilian mysticism] in relation to its Flemish counterpart.

===Hispanism in the United States and Canada===
Hispanism in the United States has a long tradition and is highly developed. To a certain extent this is a result of the United States's own history, which is tied closely to the Spanish empire and its former colonies, especially [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Cuba]]. Historically, many Americans have romanticized the Spanish legacy and given a privileged position to the Castilian language and culture, while simultaneously downplaying or rejecting the Latin American and Caribbean dialects and cultures of the Spanish-speaking areas of U.S. influence. There are now more than thirty-five million Spanish-speakers in the United States, making Spanish the second most spoken language in the country and Latinos the largest national minority. Spanish is used actively in some of the most populous states, including [[California]], [[Florida]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]], and in large cities such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[San Antonio]] and [[San Francisco]]. The [[American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese|American Association of Teachers of Spanish]] was founded in 1917 and holds a biennial congress outside the United States; ''Hispania'' is the association's official publication. (Since 1944, it is the [[American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese]].) The [[North American Academy of the Spanish Language]] brings together Spanish speakers in North America.

The first academic professorships of Spanish at United States universities were established at [[Harvard]] (1819), [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] (1825), and [[Yale]] (1826). The U.S. consul in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Obadiah Rich]], imported numerous books and valuable manuscripts that became the Obadiah Rich Collection at the [[New York Public Library]], and numerous magazines, especially the ''North American Review'', published translations. Many travelers published their impressions on Spain, such as [[Alexander Slidell Mackenzie]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_SDdqFhkfBEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=slidell+year+spain&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zB_hTZmzLqXj0QHN7aiRBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Year in Spain''] [1836] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=wFLxtgAACAAJ&amp;dq=slidell+spain+revisited&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eCThTarGGIXx0gHswYTfDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA ''Spain Revisited''] [1836]). These were read by [[Washington Irving]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and other travelers like the Sephardic journalist [[Mordecai M. Noah]] and the diplomat [[Caleb Cushing]] and his wife. Poe studied Spanish at the University of Virginia and some of his stories have Spanish settings. He also wrote scholarly articles on [[Spanish literature]].

The beginnings of Hispanism itself are found in the works of [[Washington Irving]], who met [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]] in [[Bordeaux]] in 1825 and was in Spain in 1826 (when he frequented the social gatherings of another American, [[Sarah Maria Theresa McKean]] (1780–1841), the marquise widow of [[Carlos Martínez de Irujo y Tacón|Casa Irujo]]), as well as in 1829. He went on to become ambassador between 1842 and 1846. Irving studied in Spanish libraries and met [[Martín Fernández de Navarrete]] in [[Madrid]], using one of the latter's works as a source for his ''[[A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'' (1828), and made friends and corresponded with [[Cecilia Böhl de Faber]], from where a mutual influence was born. His Romantic interest in Arab topics shaped his [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWUqAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chronicle+of+the+Conquest+of+Granada+irving&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vsjuTayQN5Gq0AGcrLnCCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada''] (1829) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=y0EXAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=alhambra+washington+irving&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FtLuTbiDNIzQsAP09ej_Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Alhambra''] (1832). McKean's social gatherings were also attended by the children of the Bostonian of Irish origin John Montgomery, who was the consul of the United States in [[Alicante]], and particularly by the Spanish-born writer [[:es:George Washington Montgomery|George Washington Montgomery]].

[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s translations of Spanish classics also form part of the history of North American Hispanism; he went through [[Madrid]] in 1829 expressing his impressions in his letters, a diary and in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZY9qU-4uJuEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=longfellow+outre-mer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BIn1Td7_OIbh0QHu2MTsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Outre-Mer''] (1833–1834). A good connoisseur of the classics, Longfellow translated [[Jorge Manrique]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=6L9jmgwz7QcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=longfellow+coplas+manrique&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K-zkTZaWOoecgQeIw9TFBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false couplets]. In order to fulfill his duties as a Spanish professor, he composed his ''Spanish Novels'' (1830), which are story adaptations of Irving and published several essays on Spanish literature and a drama, including [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr89AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Longfellow+the+spanish+student&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRv2TbPqJ-Hg0QGqqZzwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Spanish Student''] (1842), where he imitates those of the [[Spanish Golden Age]].

[[William Cullen Bryant]] translated [[Morisco]] romances and composed the poems "The Spanish Revolution" (1808) and "Cervantes" (1878). He was linked in New York to Spaniards and, as director of the ''Evening Post'', included many articles on Iberian subjects in the magazine. He was in Spain in 1847, and narrated his impressions in [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0laAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cullen+bryant+letters+of+a+traveller&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ix_2TZa0Iaux0AH3o_SnCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Letters of a traveller''] (1850–1857). In Madrid he met [[Carolina Coronado]], translating into English her poem "The Lost Bird" and novel [https://books.google.com/books?id=XuQMAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coronado+jarilla&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3x_2TYy4OaXu0gHqu_HrDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Jarilla''], both of which were published in the ''Evening Post''. But the most important group of Spanish scholars was one from Boston. The work of [[George Ticknor]], a professor of Spanish at Harvard who wrote [https://books.google.com/books?id=fbMGQNXUBooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ticknor+history+spanish+literature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FyjhTeSECOrt0gGv5cmtBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''History of Spanish Literature''], and [[William H. Prescott]], who wrote historical works on the conquest of America, are without doubt contributions of the first order. Ticknor was a friend of [[Pascual de Gayangos y Arce]], whom he met in [[London]], and visited [[Spain]] in 1818, describing his impressions in [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSAWO9MCMr8C&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=ticknor+life+letters+journal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BCH2TcWDPMXa0QGBw-XrDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ticknor%20life%20letters%20journal&amp;f=false ''Life, letters and journals''] (1876).

In the United States there are important societies that are dedicated to the study, conservation and spread of Spanish culture, of which the [[Hispanic Society of America]] is the best known. There are also libraries specialized in Hispanic matter, including ones at Tulane University, New Orleans. Important journals include ''Hispanic Review'', ''Revista de las Españas'', ''Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica'', ''Hispania'', ''Dieciocho'', ''Revista Hispánica Moderna'' and ''Cervantes''.

===Hispanism in Russia===
The history of Hispanism in [[Russia]]—before, during, and after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period—is long and deep, and it even survived the rupture of relations between Russia and Spain caused by the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This history started in the 18th century, and in the 19th century the influence of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] on [[Literary realism|realist]] novelists (such as [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], and [[Leon Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]) was profound.

Romantic travellers, such as [[:es:Sergéi Sobolevski|Sergei Sobolevski]], accumulated great libraries of books in Spanish and helped Spanish writers who visited Russia, such as [[Juan Valera y Alcalá-Galiano|Juan Valera]]. The Russian realist dramatist [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] translated the theater of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and wrote texts on Spanish Golden Age theater. [[:es:Yevgeni Salias de Tournemir|Yevgeni Salias de Tournemir]] visited Spain and published ''Apuntes de viaje por España'' (1874), shortly before [[Emilio Castelar]] published his
[https://books.google.com/books?id=AXVBAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''La Rusia contemporánea''] (1881).

The Russian Association of Hispanists, founded in 1994, is currently supported by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The field of Spanish-American studies has undergone a great increase recently. A survey in 2003 revealed that there are at least four thousand students of Spanish in Russian universities.

Twentieth-century Spanish scholars include [[:es:Sergéi Goncharenko|Sergei Goncharenko]] (mentor of a whole generation of Spanish scholars), Victor Andreyev, Vladimir Vasiliev, Natalia Miod, Svetlana Piskunova, and Vsevolod Bagno ([https://books.google.com/books?id=681dAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Vsevolod+Bagno+quijote&amp;dq=Vsevolod+Bagno+quijote&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C1QFTpjZPMyhtwfwn6DVDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA ''El Quijote vivido por los rusos'']). Recently, a Russian Hernandian Circle was founded, devoted to studying the work of [[Miguel Hernández]], who visited the USSR in September
1937.

===Hispanism in Poland===
Records of visits to Spain by Poles begin in the Middle Ages, with pilgrimages to [[Santiago de Compostela]]. According to one estimate, more than 100 Poles made the pilgrimage during that era.&lt;ref&gt;Bak, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, the humanist [[Johannes Dantiscus|Jan Dantyszek]] (1485–1548), ambassador of King [[Sigismund I the Old]] to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], traveled to the Iberian Peninsula three times and remained there for nearly ten years, becoming friends with outstanding figures such as [[Hernán Cortés]] and leaving letters of his travels. The bishop [[:pl:Piotr Dunin-Wolski|Piotr Dunin-Wolski]] took 300 Spanish books to Poland, and these were added to the [[Jagiellonian Library]] of Kraków under the name of ''Bibliotheca Volsciana''. Several professors from Spain worked in the Academy of Kraków (today known as the [[Jagiellonian University]]), including the Sevillian Garsías Cuadras and the Aragonese jurist [[:es:Pedro Ruiz de Moros|Pedro Ruiz de Moros]] (1506–1571), known in Poland as Roizjusz, who mainly wrote in Latin and was adviser to the king. The [[Society of Jesus]] was active in Poland, promoting not only Spanish ideas of theology, but also Spanish theater, which they considered a teaching tool.&lt;ref&gt;Bak, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the travelers [[:pl:Stanisław Łaski|Stanisław Łaski]], [[:pl:Andrzej Tęczyński|Andrzej Tęczyński]], [[:pl:Jan Tarnowski|Jan Tarnowski]], [[:pl:Stanisław Radziwiłł (1559-1599)|Stanisław Radziwiłł]], and Szymon Babiogórski visited Spain, among others. An anonymous traveler who arrived in Barcelona in August 1595 left an account of his impressions in a manuscript called ''Diariusz z peregrynacji włoskiej, hiszpańskiej, portugalskiej'' (''Diary of the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese Pilgrimages'').&lt;ref&gt;Bak, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the Polish nobleman [[Jakub Sobieski]] made the [[Way of St. James|pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela]] and wrote an account of his journey. In the years 1674–1675, Canon [[:pl:Andrzej Chryzostom Załuski|Andrzej Chryzostom Załuski]], Jerzy Radziwiłł, and Stanisław Radziwiłł visited Spain, and all left written testimony of their travels.

Modern Polish Hispanic Studies begin with the Romantic poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. He was followed in the 19th century by [[Joachim Lelewel]], Wojciech Dzieduszycki, [[:pl:Leonard Rettel|Leonard Rettel]], and Julian Adolf Swiecicki. [[:es:Karol Dembowski|Karol Dembowski]] wrote, in French, a [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_cRRQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Karol+Dembowski&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1IEHTvzMG6H50gH-x5z3Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg book on his travels] in Spain and Portugal during [[Carlist Wars|First Carlist War]].

[[:es:Félix Rozanski|Felix Rozanski]], Edward Porebowicz and [[Zygmunt Czerny]] were enthusiastic translators who taught in Poland at that time. Maria Strzałkowa wrote the first [https://books.google.com/books?id=VCJcHQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Maria+Strza%C5%82kowa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yYMHTuW8EKfk0QG5rvXdCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK outline of history of Spanish literature] in Polish. Other important translators include Kazimierz Zawanowski, Zofia Szleyen, Kalina Wojciechowska, and Zofia Chądzyńska.

The poet and Hispanist [[:es:Florian Smieja|Florian Śmieja]] taught Spanish and Spanish American literature in London, Ontario. In 1971 the first professorship of Hispanic Studies not subordinate to a department of Romance literature was created at the [[University of Warsaw]], and in the following year a degree program in Hispanic Studies was instituted there. Today it is called the Institute of Iberian and Latin American Studies. Those who have taught in it include Urszula Aszyk-Bangs, M.-Pierrette Malcuzynski (1948–2004), Robert Mansberger Amorós, Víctor Manuel Ferreras, and Carlos Marrodán Casas. In Kraków the first National Symposium of Spanish Scholars was held in 1985. The historians [[Janusz Tazbir]] and Jan Kienewicz wrote on Spanish themes, as did the literary scholars Gabriela Makowiecka, Henryk Ziomek, Beata Baczynska, [[:pl:Florian Śmieja|Florian Śmieja]], Piotr Sawicki, and Kazimierz Sabik. Grzegorz Bak studied the image of Spain in 19th-century Polish literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bak&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hispanism in Portugal and Brazil===

====Brazil====
The integration of Brazil into [[Mercosur]] in 1991 created a need for closer relations between Brazil and the Hispanic world, as well as better knowledge of the Spanish language within Brazil. For this reason, Brazil has promoted the inclusion of Spanish as a required subject in the country's education system. A large core of Spanish scholars formed at the [[University of São Paulo]], including [[:pt:Fidelino de Figueiredo|Fidelino de Figueiredo]], Luis Sánchez y Fernández, and José Lodeiro. The year 1991 also marks the creation of the ''Anuario Brasileño de Estudios Hispánicos'', whose [http://www.mec.es/sgci/br/es/publicaciones/anuario/abeh2000s.pdf ''Suplemento: El hispanismo en Brasil'' (2000)], traces the history of Hispanic Studies in the country. In 2000 the first Congresso Brasileiro de Hispanistas took place, and its proceedings were published under the title [https://books.google.com/books?id=g9GBAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Hispanismo+2000&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BKYHTsnZJ66v0AHmv7H5Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ ''Hispanismo 2000'']. At that meeting, the Associação Brasileira de Hispanistas was established. The organization's second congress took place in 2002, and since then it has been held every two years.

====Portugal====
Compared to Brazil, Portugal has shown less interest in Hispanism; it was not until 2005 that a national association for it was founded. Portuguese activities in this field are mostly of a [[Comparative literature|comparatist]] nature and focus on Luso-Spanish topics, partly because of academic and administrative reasons. The journal [http://web.letras.up.pt/ibericos/peninsulaesp.htm ''Península''] is one of the most important Hispanist journals in the country. Portuguese Hispanism appears somewhat limited, and to an extent there is a mutual distrust between the two cultures, motivated by a history of conflicts and rivalry. Nevertheless, Portuguese writers of the Renaissance—such as the dramatist [[Gil Vicente]], [[Jorge de Montemayor]], [[Francisco Sá de Miranda]], and the historian [[Dom Francisco Manuel de Mello|Francisco Manuel de Mello]]—wrote in both Spanish and Portuguese.

===Hispanism in Italy===
The cultural relationship between Spain and Italy developed early in the Middle Ages, especially centered in [[Naples]] through the relation that it had with the [[Crown of Aragon]] and Sicily, and intensified during the Spanish Pre-Renaissance and Renaissance through Castile. [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] engaged members of the [[Accademia Pontaniana]] and introduced the [[Petrarch]]ian metrical style and themes to Spanish lyric poetry. This close relation extended throughout the periods of [[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th century the poet Giambattista Conti (1741–1820) was perhaps the foremost Spanish scholar, translator and anthologist of Europe. Dramatist, critic, and theater historiographer [[:es:Pietro Napoli Signorelli|Pietro Napoli Signorelli]] (1731–1815) defended Spanish literature against critics such as [[Girolamo Tiraboschi]] and [[Saverio Bettinelli]], who accused it of "bad taste", "corruption", and "barbarism". [[Giacomo Casanova]] and [[Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti|Giuseppe Baretti]] traveled throughout Spain, leaving interesting descriptions of their experiences: Baretti was fluent in Spanish. The critic Guido Bellico was in the [[Colegio Imperial de Madrid|Reales Estudios de San Isidro]] with the eminent  Arabist Mariano Pizzi. Among other prominent Italian Hispanists were Leonardo Capitanacci, Ignazio Gajone, Placido Bordoni, Giacinto Ceruti, Francesco Pesaro, Giuseppe Olivieri, Giovanni Querini and Marco Zeno.&lt;ref&gt;Quinziano, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Italian Romanticism took great interest in the Spanish ''[[romancero]]'', with translations by [https://books.google.com/books?id=3w0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Giovanni+Berchet+1837&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7xAIToY5kKW3B5H6xLsN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false [[Giovanni Berchet]]] in 1837 and [https://books.google.com/books?id=uH0SHQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Pietro+Monti+1855&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hhAITp7KMIvBtgfX66DfDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ Pietro Monti] in 1855. [[Edmondo de Amicis]] traveled throughout Spain and wrote a [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg5FAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Edmundo+de+Amicis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XBEITq7pB4ugtweZopTRDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Edmundo%20de%20Amicis&amp;f=false book] of his impressions. [[:es:Antonio Restori|Antonio Restori]] (1859–1928), a professor at the Universities of Messina and of Genoa, published some works of Lope de Vega and dedicated his [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wIzAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Saggi+di+bibliografia+teatrale+spagnuola&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CxIITr6qKMebtwf6hMjlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA ''Saggi di bibliografia teatrale spagnuola''] (1927) to the bibliography of the Spanish theater; he also wrote ''Il Cid, studio storico-critico'' (1881) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=reQPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=La+gesta+del+Cid+Restori&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ohIITuqvEsKjtge_qsxd&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=La%20gesta%20del%20Cid%20Restori&amp;f=false ''Le gesta del Cid''] (1890). [[:es:Bernardo Sanvisenti|Bernardo Sanvisenti]], a professor of Spanish language and literature at the University of Milan, wrote [https://books.google.com/books?id=lccAAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Manuale+di+letteratura+spagnuola+1907&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LBMITu2EFYGbtwfpp9zJDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Manuale di letteratura spagnuola''] (1907), as well as a [https://books.google.com/books?id=0HQNAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=I+primi+influssi+di+Dante,+del+Petrarca&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6xMITvG9OMu3twe36qG4DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false study] (1902) on the influence of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] in Spanish literature.

Italian Hispanism arose from three sources, already identifiable in the 19th century. The first of these was the Spanish hegemonic presence in the Italian peninsula, which sparked interest in the study of Spain and in the creation of works about Spain. Secondly, Italian Hispanism was encouraged by a [[Comparative literature|comparatist]] approach, and in fact the first Italian studies on literature in Spanish were of a comparative nature, such as [[Benedetto Croce]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=p1poAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=La+Spagna+nella+vita+italiana+durante+la+Rinascenza+1907&amp;dq=La+Spagna+nella+vita+italiana+durante+la+Rinascenza+1907&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MpIITprxH5PUgAfdobncDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA ''La Spagna nella vita italiana durante la Rinascenza''] (1907) and the works of [[:es:Arturo Farinelli|Arturo Farinelli]] and Bernardino Sanvisenti, which were dedicated to the relationships between Spain and Italy, Italy and Germany, and Spain and Germany. Thirdly, the development of Italian Hispanism was supported by Romance philology, especially through the works of [[:es:Mario Casella|Mario Casella]] (author of [https://books.google.com/books?id=KAmyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Cervantes+il+Chisciotte%27%27+1938&amp;dq=Cervantes+il+Chisciotte%27%27+1938&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bZQIToeRF5K_gQeO48DWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ ''Cervantes: Il Chisciotte''] [1938]), [[:es:Ezio Levi|Ezio Levi]], [[:es:Salvatore Battaglia|Salvatore Battaglia]], and [[:es:Giovanni Maria Bertini|Giovanni Maria Bertini]] (translator of Spanish modern poetry, especially the poems of [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]]). [[:es:Cesare de Lollis|Cesare de Lollis]] also made important contributions to Cervantes studies.

The field of modern Hispanic Studies originated in 1945, with the trio of [[:es:Oreste Macrì|Oreste Macrì]] (editor of works of [[Antonio Machado]] and of Fray [[Luis de León]]), [[:es:Guido Mancini|Guido Mancini]], and [[:es:Franco Meregalli|Franco Meregalli]]. Eventually Spanish-American studies emerged as an area of independent of the literature of Spain. Between 1960 and 1970 the first professorships of Spanish-American language and literature were created, pioneered by Giovanni Meo Zilio, who occupied the first chair of that sort created at the [[University of Florence]] in 1968. He was followed by [[:es:Giuseppe Bellini|Giuseppe Bellini]] (historian of Spanish-American literature, translator of [[Pablo Neruda]], and student of [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]); [[:es:Roberto Paoli|Roberto Paoli]] (Peruvianist and translator of [[César Vallejo]]); and [[:es:Darío Puccini|Dario Puccini]] (student of the lyric poetry of Sor [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]], as well as that of the 20th century).

The [http://www.aispi.it/ Association of Italian Hispanists] (AISPI) was created in May 1973 and has held numerous congresses almost annually since then. Italian Hispanists include [[:es:Silvio Pellegrini|Silvio Pellegrini]], [[:es:Pio Rajna|Pio Rajna]], [[:es:Antonio Viscardi|Antonio Viscardi]], [[:es:Luigi Sorrento|Luigi Sorrento]], [[:es:Guido Tammi|Guido Tammi]], [[:es:Francesco Vian|Francesco Vian]], [[:es:Juana Granados de Bagnasco|Juana Granados de Bagnasco]], [[:es:Gabriele Ranzato|Gabriele Ranzato]], [[:es:Lucio Ambruzzi|Lucio Ambruzzi]], [[:es:Eugenio Mele|Eugenio Mele]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3rzHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Manlio+Castello&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JxsKTum1EJPMsQKkoJDdAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA Manlio Castello], [[:es:Francesco Ugolini|Francesco Ugolini]], Lorenzo Giussi, [http://www.google.com/search?q=Elena+Milazzo&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Elena Milazzo], [[:es:Luigi de Filippo|Luigi de Filippo]], [[:es:Carmelo Samonà|Carmelo Samonà]], [[:it:Giuseppe Carlo Rossi|Giuseppe Carlo Rossi]], the poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] (who translated [[Luis de Góngora|Góngora]]) and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[:es:Margherita Morreale|Margherita Morreale]], [[:es:Giovanni Maria Bertini|Giovanni Maria Bertini]], [[Giuliano Bonfante]], [[Carlo Bo]] (who worked with the poetry of [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]]), [[:es:Ermanno Caldera|Ermanno Caldera]], [[:es:Rinaldo Froldi|Rinaldo Froldi]], and [[:es:Guido Mancini|Guido Mancini]] (author of a [https://books.google.com/books?id=LHnyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Storia+della+letteratura+spagnola&amp;dq=Storia+della+letteratura+spagnola&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2hgKTv7wD4uEsALUrZ2RAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA ''Storia della letteratura spagnola''].

===Hispanism in Israel===
At the time of its founding in 1948, the modern state of Israel already included a substantial Spanish-speaking community. Their language, [[Judeo-Spanish]], was derived from [[Old Spanish]] along a path of development that diverged from that of the Spanish of Spain and its empire, beginning in 1492, when the [[Sephardi Jews|Jews]] were [[Alhambra Decree|expelled]] from Spain. Between the 16th and 20th centuries many of them lived in the old [[Ottoman Empire]] and North Africa. There are some 100,000 speakers of Judeo-Spanish in Israel today.

At present there are several Israeli media outlets in (standard Castilian) Spanish, some of which have a long history. The newsweekly ''Aurora'', for example, was founded in the late 1960s, and today it also has an [http://www.aurora-israel.co.il/ online edition]. Israel has at least three radio stations that broadcast in Spanish.

Modern Israeli Hispanists include [[:es:Samuel Miklos Stern|Samuel Miklos Stern]] (the discoverer of the Spanish [[kharja]]s and a student of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]), professor [[Benzion Netanyahu]], and Haim Beinart. Other Israeli scholars have studied the literature and history of Spain, frequently influenced by the theses of [[Américo Castro]]. ''[[Don Quixote]]'' has been translated into Hebrew twice, first by Natan Bistritzky and Nahman Bialik (Jerusalem, Sifriat Poalim, 1958), and later (Tel Aviv: Hakibutz Hameuchad, 1994) by Beatriz Skroisky-Landau and Luis Landau, the latter a professor in the Department of Hebrew Literature at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] and author of ''Cervantes and the Jews'' (Beer Sheva: Ben-Gurion University Press, 2002). The historian [[:es:Yosef Kaplan|Yosef Kaplan]] has written numerous works and has translated [[Isaac Cardoso]]'s ''Las excelencias y calumnias de los hebreos'' into Hebrew. The [http://www.ahisrael.org/SobreAHI.htm Asociación de Hispanistas de Israel] was created on 21 June 2007 at the [http://telaviv.cervantes.es/es/default.shtm Instituto Cervantes de Tel Aviv], consisting of over thirty professors, researchers and intellectuals linked to the languages, literatures, history and cultures of Spain, Portugal, Latin America and the Judeo-Spanish Sephardic world. Its first meeting was convened by professors [[:es:Ruth Fine|Ruth Fine]] ([[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]), who was appointed the first president of the association; Raanán Rein ([[Tel Aviv University]]); Aviva Dorón ([[University of Haifa]]); and Tamar Alexander ([[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]]).

===Hispanism in the Arab world===
Spain's links with the Arab world began in the Middle Ages with the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]]. Arabic-speaking [[Al-Andalus|Moorish kingdoms]] were present in Spain until 1492, when the [[Reconquista]] defeated the [[Emirate of Granada]]. Many Moors remained in Spain until their final expulsion in 1609. The [[Spanish Empire]], at its height, included a number of Arabic-speaking enclaves in the [[Maghreb]], such as [[Spanish Sahara]] and [[Spanish Morocco]].

The Moroccan historian [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari]] (c. 1591 – 1632) wrote about the Muslim dynasties in Spain. The Egyptian poet [[Ahmed Shawqi]] (1869–1932) spent six years of exile in Andalusia. Perhaps the first "scientific" Arab Hispanist was the Lebanese writer [[Shakib Arslan]] (1869–1946), who wrote a book about his trips to Spain in three volumes. The Egyptian writer [[Taha Husayn]] (1889–1973) promoted the renewal of relations with Spain, among other European countries of the Mediterranean, and led the creation of an edition of the great 12th-century Andalusian literary encyclopedia ''Al-Dajira'', of [[Ibn Bassam]]. Other important figures were 'Abd al-`Aziz al-Ahwani, 'Abd Allah `Inan, Husayn Mu'nis, Salih al-Astar, Mahmud Mekki, and Hamid Abu Ahmad. Linked to the [[:es:Instituto Egipcio de Estudios Islámicos en Madrid|Egyptian Institute of Madrid]] are Ahmad Mukhtar al-'Abbadi (who specialized in the history of Moorish Granada), Ahmad Haykal, Salah Fadl, As'ad Sharif 'Umar, and Nagwa Gamal Mehrez. The [http://www.heg-eg.org/ Asociación de Hispanistas de Egipto] was formed in 1968. The First Colloquium of Arab Hispanism took place in Madrid in  1975.&lt;ref&gt;Utray Sardá, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hispanism in the Netherlands===
In spite of [[Dutch Revolt|a bitter war]] between Spain and the United Provinces in the late 16th century, Hispanism has deep roots in the Netherlands. The influence of [[Spanish Golden Age]] literature can be seen in the work of the Dutch poet and playwright [[Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero|Gerbrand Bredero]] and in the translations of  [[:es:Guilliam de Bay|Guilliam de Bay]] in the 17th century. Nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]] aroused Dutch curiosity about the exoticism of things Spanish. The Arabist [[Reinhart Dozy]] (1820–1883) made important contributions to the study of the Moorish domination in Spain, including [https://books.google.com/books?id=k5pWDAFhIzQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dozy+Histoire+des+Musulmans+d%27Espagne&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nswRTpzBDIS3twe_7aXVDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne''] (1861) and the continuation [https://books.google.com/books?id=nsW93SQfEJkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dozy+Recherches+l%27Histoire+et+litt%C3%A9rature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6swRTvDuMMjd0QHNhtyuDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Recherches sur l'Histoire et littérature de l'Espagne''], which was published in its definitive form in 1881. A few years later, the Dutch scholar [[:es:Fonger de Haan|Fonger de Haan]] (1859–1930) held the chair of Spanish literature at [[Boston University]]. Two of his publications, [https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_605142 ''Pícaros y ganapanes''] (1899) and [https://books.google.com/books?id=weoCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=haan+outline+of+the+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5NARTtrxLZO6tgfyo5zhDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''An Outline of the History of the'' Novela Picaresca ''in Spain''] (1903) still serve as starting points for research today. In 1918 he tried in vain to spark the interest of the State [[University of Groningen]] in Hispanic Studies, but nevertheless donated his library of Hispanic Studies to it a few years later.

Serious studies of literature gained new impetus thanks to the work of [[:es:Jan te Winkel|Jan te Winkel]] of the [[University of Amsterdam]] who, with his seven-volume
[https://books.google.com/books?id=hwUoAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jan+te+Winkel+Ontwikkelingsgang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4tsRTpfAOcicgQew5t2FDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''De Ontwikkelingsgang der Nederlandsche Letterkunde''] (1908–1921), drew attention to the influence that Spanish literature exerted on Dutch literature in the 17th century. Other researchers, such as [[:es:William Davids|William Davids]] (1918), [[:es:Joseph Vles|Joseph Vles]] (1926) and [[:es:Simon Anselmus Vosters|Simon Vosters]] (1955), continued in the same direction as te Winkel. Two Romanists who were of great importance to Dutch Hispanism were Salverda de Grave and Sneyders de Vogel. [[:es:Jean Jacques Salverda de Grave|Jean Jacques Salverda de Grave]] (1863–1947) became a professor of Romance philology at the [[University of Groningen]] in 1907, and he was succeeded by [[:es:Kornelis Sneyders de Vogel|Kornelis Sneyders de Vogel]] (1876–1958) in 1921. In 1906, for the first time since 1659, a

Doctor W. J. van Baalen was an important popularizer of the history, customs, and wealth of Spanish America, producing ten books in those areas. Along with C. F. A. Van Dam, he founded the Nederlandsch Zuid-Amerikaansch Instituut in order to promote commercial and cultural contact between both worlds. The Groningen poet [[Hendrik de Vries]] (1896–1989) travelled twelve times to Spain between 1924 and 1936 and—although his father, an eminent philologist and polyglot, always refused to study Spanish because of the [[Eighty Years' War]]—the poet dedicated his book of poems [https://books.google.com/books?id=sVdAGQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Hendrik+de+Vries+iberia+1964&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ezsSTtaZBYGSgQe1ppT-DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Iberia''] (1964) to Spain.

In the Netherlands, the Institute of Hispanic Studies at the [[University of Utrecht]] was founded in 1951 by [[:es:Cornelis Frans Adolf van Dam|Cornelis Frans Adolf van Dam]] (who was a student of [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]]) and has since been an important center for Spanish scholars. The Mexican Training Center at the [[University of Groningen]] was established in 1993.

Johan Brouwer, who wrote his thesis on Spanish mysticism, produced twenty-two books on Spanish subjects, as well as numerous translations. [[:es:Jonas Andries van Prague|Jonas Andries van Prague]], a professor at Groningen, studied Spanish Golden Age theater in the Netherlands and the [[Generation of '98]], as well as the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] refugee writers in the Netherlands. [[Cees Nooteboom]] has written books about travel to Spain, including [https://books.google.com/books?id=FC9fiEgbf_IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cees+Nooteboom&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bY8STo7aNI6SgQeHyuSKCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Roads to Santiago''].[[:es:Barber van de Pol|Barber van de Pol]] produced a Dutch translation of ''Don Quixote'' in 1994, and Hispanism continues to be promoted by Dutch writers such as Rik Zaal  ([https://books.google.com/books?id=sk5-AAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Rik+Zaal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=upISTrasB5OcgQeTpLzrAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ ''Alles over Spanje'')], Gerrit Jan Zwier, Arjen Duinker, Jean Pierre Rawie, Els Pelgrom ([https://books.google.com/books?id=6eZLGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Els+Pelgrom&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6JMSTrSHAsPEgQeC76TdDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ ''The Acorn Eaters'']), Chris van der Heijden ([https://books.google.com/books?id=GrU-HQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Chris+van+der+Heijden&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SpQSTv7qJZDqgAfMiMGHDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''The Splendour of Spain from Cervantes to Velázquez'']), [[Lou Lichtveld|"Albert Helman"]], Maarten Steenmeijer, and Jean Arnoldus Schalekamp ([https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zncQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Jean+Schalekamp&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RpUSTviFOs7TgAfSvIGpCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ ''This is Majorca: The Balearic Islands : Minorca, Ibiza, Formentera'']).

''Don Quixote'' was translated into [[Danish language|Danish]] (1776–1777) by [[Charlotte Dorothea Biehl]], who also translated Cervantes's ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1780–1781). [[Hans Christian Andersen]] made a trip to Spain and kept a diary about his experiences. Other prominent Danish Hispanists include [[:es:Knud Togeby|Knud Togeby]]; Carl Bratli (''Spansk-dansk Ordbog'' [Spanish/Danish dictionary], 1947); Johann Ludwig Heiberg (1791–1860, [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] studies); Kristoffer Nyrop (1858–1931, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vqNEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Kristoffer+Nyrop&amp;dq=Kristoffer+Nyrop&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xFsTTpu_M4Xf0QG7g_msDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDge ''Spansk grammatik'']); and Valdemar Beadle (Middle Ages and the Spanish and Italian Baroque).

In [[Sweden]], prominent Hispanists include [[:es:Erik Staaf|Erik Staaf]]; [[:es:Edvard Lidforss|Edvard Lidforss]] (translator of ''Don Quixote'' into Swedish); [[:es:Gunnar Tilander|Gunnar Tilander]] (publisher of medieval Spanish ''[[fuero]]s''); [[:es:Alf Lombard|Alf Lombard]]; Karl Michaëlson; [[:es:Emanuel Walberg|Emanuel Walberg]]; Bertil Maler (who edited [https://books.google.com/books?id=hnybbwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Bertil+Maler&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RGETTtX_NIGv0AHWp5nADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBzge ''Tratado de las enfermedades de las aves de caza'']); [[:es:Magnus Mörner|Magnus Mörner]]; [[:es:Bengt Hasselrot|Bengt Hasselrot]]; and [[:es:Nils Hedberg|Nils Hedberg]]. [[:es:Inger Enkvist|Inger Enkvist]] researched Latin American novels and [[Juan Goytisolo]].

====Norway====
Hispanism was founded in [[Norway]] by professor [[:es:Magnus Gronvold|Magnus Gronvold]], who translated ''Don Quixote'' into Norwegian in collaboration with [[Nils Kjær]]. Leif Sletsjoe (author of [https://books.google.com/books?id=97hiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Leif+Sletsjoe&amp;dq=Leif+Sletsjoe&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uGcTTsnsNsHd0QGMivX7DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Sancho Panza, hombre de bien'']) and Kurt E. Sparre (a [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] scholar) were both professors at the [[University of Oslo]]. Currently there is a strong and renewed interest in Hispanism among Norwegian youth, and the 21st century has seen the publication of at least three Spanish grammars for Norwegians—one by [https://books.google.com/books?id=ecwcQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Spansk+grammatikk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J2kTTuijN6jx0gGW6JS1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ Cathrine Grimseid] (2005); another by [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zQeQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Spansk+grammatikk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J2kTTuijN6jx0gGW6JS1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg Johan Falk, Luis Lerate, and Kerstin Sjölin] (2008); and one by [https://books.google.com/books?id=0c81QAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Spansk+grammatikk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qWoTTqG3Gcn40gGKsP2WDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDgK Ana Beatriz Chiquito] (2008). There is an Association of Norwegian Hispanism, a National Association of Professors of Spanish, and several journals, including ''La Corriente del Golfo (Revista Noruega de Estudios Latinoamericanos'', ''Tribune'', and ''Romansk forum''.

====Finland====
In [[Finland]], at the beginning of the 20th century there was an important group of Hispanists in [[Helsinki]], including [[Oiva Tuulio|Oiva J. Tallgren]] (1878–1941; he adopted the surname Tuulio in 1933); his wife [[Tyyni Tuulio]] (1892–1991); [[Eero K. Neuvonen]] (1904–1981), who studied [https://books.google.com/books?id=IkgmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Eero+Neuvonen&amp;dq=Eero+Neuvonen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=27ITTpT6I5CSgQeFrsH9BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg Arabisms in Old Spanish]; and Sinikka Kallio-Visapää (translator of [[José Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset]]).

===Hispanism in Romania===
In Romania, the initiator of Hispanism was [[Ștefan Vârgolici]], who translated a great part of ''Don Quixote'' into Romanian and published—under the title ''Studies on Spanish Literature'' (Jasi, 1868–1870)—works on [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], and [[Lope de Vega]], which had appeared in the journal ''Convorbiri literare'' (Literary Conversations). [[Alexandru Popescu-Telega]] (1889–1970) wrote a book on [[Miguel de Unamuno|Unamuno]] (1924), a comparison between Romanian and Spanish [[folklore]] (1927), a biography of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] (1944), a translation from the [[romancero]] (1947), a [https://books.google.com/books?id=p9c8AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Alexandru+Popescu-Telega+Unamuno&amp;dq=Alexandru+Popescu-Telega+Unamuno&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=P2wUTruQNMrt0gGCoeHlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ book on Hispanic Studies in Romania] (1964), and an anthology in Romanian. [[Ileana Georgescu]], [[George Călinescu]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=JX7ZPQAACAAJ&amp;dq=George+C%C4%83linescu+cervantes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lG8UToa6CKmp0AGd3o2CDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw ''Iscusitul hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha'']), and [[Tudor Vianu]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=eR21YgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Tudor+Vianu+cervantes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N3AUTvmJEqLv0gGZm8j_DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Cervantes'']) have published books on Cervantes.

===Hispanism in Asia and the Pacific===
There is an Asian Association of Spanish Scholars ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111002043007/http://hispanismo.cervantes.es/Asociaciones_ficha.asp?DOCN=12 Asociación Asiática de Hispanistas ]), which was founded in 1985 and meets every three years.

====The Philippines====
Hispanism in Asia and the Pacific is mostly related to the literature and languages of the [[Philippines]], where Spanish has a history as a colonial language. In 1900 a million Filipinos spoke Spanish as their mother tongue; [[Spanish language in the Philippines|estimates of the number of Filipinos whose first language is Spanish]] today vary widely, ranging from 2,660 to over 400,000. Spanish remains alive in some [[creole languages]], such as [[Chavacano language|Chabacano]]. In [[Manila]], the [[Instituto Cervantes|Cervantes Institute]] has given Spanish classes for years, and the [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language]] is involved in the teaching and standard use of Spanish in the Philippines. But there is no institution or association that brings together and defends the interests of Hispanic Filipinos themselves. The most important Spanish scholars—aside from the national hero, poet and novelist [[José Rizal]] (who wrote in Spanish)—are Antonio M. Molina (not the composer [[Antonio Molina (composer)|Antonio J. Molina]]), José María Castañer, [[Edmundo Farolan]], [[Guillermo Gómez Rivera|Guillermo Gómez]], Miguel Fernández Passion, Alfonso Felix, and Lourdes Castrillo de Brillantes. The weekly ''Nueva Era'', edited by [[Guillermo Gómez Rivera]], is the only newspaper in Spanish still published in the Philippines, although the quarterly journal [http://www.revista.carayanpress.com/ ''Revista Filipina''], edited by Edmundo Farolán, also exists, in print and online.

====Japan====
The first Japanese institution to offer Spanish language classes, in 1897, was the Language School of Tokyo, known today as the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]]. There, [[:es:Gonzalo Jiménez de la Espada|Gonzalo Jiménez de la Espada]] mentored the first Japanese Hispanists, including Hirosada Nagata (1885–1973, now considered a "patriarch" of Hispanism in Japan) and Shizuo Kasai. Meanwhile, the [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] established Hispanic Studies in its curriculum in 1921, but most university Hispanic Studies departments were founded in the 1970s and '80s. Translations of ''Don Quixote'' into Japanese are at first incomplete and by way of an English version (e.g. one by Shujiro Watanabe in 1887, and others in 1893, 1901, 1902, and 1914). Japanese versions of ''Don Quixote'' in its entirety—although still based on an English translation—were published in 1915 (by Hogetsu Shimamura and Noburu Katakami) and in 1927–28 (by Morita). In 1948, Hirosada Nagata published a nearly-complete direct (from the Spanish) Japanese translation. It fell to Nagata's student, Masatake Takahashi (1908–1984), to complete that translation (published in 1977). Meanwhile, an entire, direct Japanese translation of ''Don Quixote'' was also produced (the two parts in 1958 and 1962) by Yu Aida&lt;ref&gt;Not [[Yu Aida]] the ''manga'' author, born in 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; (1903–1971).&lt;ref&gt;Serrano Vélez, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.soc.nii.ac.jp/ajh/indexsp.htm Asociación Japonesa de Hispanistas] was founded in Tokyo in 1955, consisting mostly of university professors. The association publishes the journal [http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/ajh/hispanica_es.html ''Hispánica'']. The journal [http://hispanismo.cervantes.es/archivo.asp?DOCN=8 ''Lingüística Hispánica''] is published by the Círculo de Lingüística Hispánica de Kansai.

Japanese Hispanism was surveyed by Ryohei Uritani in the article "Historia del hispanismo en el Japón", which was published in the journal ''Español actual: Revista de español vivo'' (48 [1987], 69–92).

====Korea====
The relations between Spain and [[Korea]] began with [[:es:Gregorio Céspedes|Gregorio Céspedes]] in the 16th century, who was studied by [http://cvc.cervantes.es/ensenanza/biblioteca_ele/asele/pdf/10/10_0503.pdf Chul Park]. Spanish education in Korea has continued for the past fifty years, and there is currently a strong demand for it. Since 2001, Spanish has been an optional language in secondary education. The Asociación Coreana de Hispanistas was founded in 1981 and holds two annual congresses, one in June and another in December. It also publishes the journal ''Hispanic Studies''.

The '''Hoosier Salon''' is an annual juried art exhibition that features the work of [[Indiana]] artists and provides them with an outlet to market their work. The Hoosier Salon Patron's Association, the nonprofit arts organization that organizes the event, also operates year-round galleries in [[Carmel, Indiana]] and [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. These spaces host exhibitions of Salon artists throughout the year, as well as workshops and demonstrations. An artist must have lived in [[Indiana]] and must be a member of the Hoosier Salon arts organization to become eligible for the Salon's exhibitions. The Hoosier Salon has exhibited art from many of Indiana's most notable painters, sculptors, cartoonists, and mixed-media artists, including [[Hoosier Group]] artists, several members of the [[Brown County Art Colony]], and other artists with ties to Indiana.

The Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], hosted the first annual Hoosier Salon in 1925 at the [[Marshall Field and Company]]'s galleries in [[Chicago]]. In 1942 the annual exhibition was relocated to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, where it has been held at several venues, including the [[William H. Block Co.|William H. Block Company]] and the [[L. S. Ayres|L. S. Ayres and Company]] department stores, the [[Indiana State Museum]], and the [[Indiana Historical Society]]. The Hoosier Salon has survived wars, economic recessions, a fire, venue changes for its annual exhibition, relocation of its offices and gallery spaces, and modifications to its outreach programs. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth continuous year of annual exhibitions.

==Mission==
The Hoosier Salon is a statewide nonprofit arts organization whose mission is to "create an appreciation of art by promoting Hoosier artists and their art."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoosiersalon.org/index.html Welcome to the Hoosier Salon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420192655/http://www.hoosiersalon.org/index.html |date=April 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=88cat&gt;{{cite book | title =Hoosier Salon 88th Annual Exhibition: Where Art and History Converge | publisher =Hoosier Salon Art Patrons Association | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2012 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | url = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salon's exhibitions also provide viewers an opportunity to see and appreciate the talents of artists with ties to Indiana.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; The organization's vision is to foster an appreciation for visual art through activities that "educate, inspire, and enhance the lives of the citizens of our state while promoting the creativity, talent and technique of Indiana artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hoosier Salon: About | work = | publisher =Hoosier Salon | date = | url = http://hoosiersalon.org/about-2/ | format = | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoosiersalon.org/aboutus.html Hoosier Salon: Our Legacy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927063413/http://www.hoosiersalon.org/aboutus.html |date=September 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins in Chicago===
The idea for the Hoosier Salon originated in May 1924, when the 160-member Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the Chicago metro area, held a gathering devoted to [[Hoosier]] painters.&lt;ref name=GT1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Judith Vale Newton |author2=Carol Weiss | title =A Grand Tradition: The Arts and Artists of the Hoosier Salon, 1925–1990  | publisher =Hoosier Salon Patrons Association | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1993 | location =Indianapolis, IN | page =1 | url = | isbn =0-9638360-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this initial meeting, Estella King, chair of the group's arts committee, led the organization's plans for an exhibition featuring high quality artwork from Hoosier artists that would help gain more recognition for them outside of Indiana. The group's goals were to inspire Indiana artists to develop their talents, to showcase artists who depicted Indiana themes in their work, and to provide an opportunity to market their art.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank15&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marilyn Shank| title =Art for Indiana's Sake: A History of the Hoosier Salon | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =24 | issue =3 | page =15 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Summer 2012 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoosier Salon's name and concept come from the nineteenth-century French tradition of annual art exhibitions held in the [[Grand Palais|Grand Palais des Champs- Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton23&gt;{{cite journal | author=Judith V. Newton | title =This Eternal Beauty: Celebrating the Art of the Hoosier Salon | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =6 | issue =4| pages =23 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Fall 1994 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, [[Illinois]], was selected as the site for the first Hoosier Salon because of its large population and its reputation as a [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] art center.&lt;ref name=GT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt; The annual Salon ran in Chicago from 1925 through 1941, when it moved to [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Since January 1942 the annual exhibition has taken place at various sites around Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Newton24&gt;Newton, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early exhibitions===
The first Hoosier Salon ran from March 9 to 19, 1925, at the art galleries of [[Marshall Field's|Marshall Field and Company]] at 28 East Washington Street in Chicago.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 15 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daughters of Indiana, who organized and sponsored the first Salon, were assisted by several other groups, such as the Indiana Society of Chicago and volunteers from Chicago's [[Earlham College]] Alumni Association.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;

The first Hoosier Salon was open to painters who had lived in Indiana for at least a year. Entries for the juried exhibition were submitted from across the United States. The selections featured 253 works of art from 132 artists.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=IHS-INP&gt;{{cite journal | title =Hoosier Salon: Celebrating a 90-Year History of Honoring Indiana Artists | journal =INPerspective | volume =20 | issue =3 | page =6 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis, IN | date =May 2014 | language = | url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoosier Group artist T. C. Steele and his wife, Selma, attended the opening of the Salon's first exhibition, which was well received by art critics and the public.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT2-3&gt;Newton and Weiss, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first exhibition's favorites was a set of three "[[Little Orphan Annie]]" cartoons from their creator, [[Harold Gray]], a 1917 graduate of [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt; Hoosier artists whose work also appeared at the first Salon included all four Hoosier Group members who were still living ([[T.C. Steele]], [[William Forsyth (artist)|William Forsyth]], [[Otto Stark]], and [[J. Ottis Adams]]). Other exhibitors with Indiana ties included [[Wayman Elbridge Adams]], [[Frank V. Dudley]], Frederick M. Polley, [[Will Vawter|J. Will Vawter]], [[Eugene Savage]], and Clifton Wheeler, among others. Traditional Indiana landscapes and still-life paintings were represented, as well as works from Hoosier artists who lived outside the state.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18&gt;Shank, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first Hoosier Salon merit prizes were awarded to Steele for ''Winter Morning, First Snow'', judged best picture  and painted by a man more than sixty years of age. Wayman Adams won a $200 merit award for his oil portrait of Indiana author [[Booth Tarkington]], and Forsyth's ''Glory of Autumn'' still life won a $100 merit prize. Savage, who was originally from [[Covington, Indiana]], won the top prize of $500 for ''Recessional''. Thirty percent of the accepted entries came from women artists, including two works submitted by [[Marie Goth]]. Several women were recognized with merit prizes for their art: Dorothy Morlan for ''Frosty Morning, Southern Indiana''; Lucy M. Taggert for ''Eleanor''; Laura A. Fry for ''A Shaft of Sunlight''; Lucie Hartrath for ''The Valley, Morning''; and [[Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer]] for ''A Garden''.&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louise Zaring]] received a prize for Best Marine Scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b75ab2bab49cc41eda0989f2e&amp;id=3c2f9b5474|title=Indiana and Florida artist Louise Eleanor Zaring|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marguerite B. Williams, art critic for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', remarked at the time of the first Salon that Indiana was well known for its writers; however, "it would seem that some of this desire for self-expression has overflowed into painting for there is probably no other state that could show as many and such a high average of practically unknown painters."&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; Hoosier authors Tarkington, [[George Ade]], and [[Meredith Nicholson]] supported the idea of an annual exhibition featuring Indiana artists. In the forward to the Hoosier Salon's exhibition catalog in 1926, Nicholson wrote, "we are anxious for our brothers and sisters who paint or draw or sculpt to have their day in court, just as we have had it."&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt;

Following the critical and popular success of the first exhibition, the Daughters of Indiana wanted to make it an annual event that was open to artists with ties to Indiana. In 1926 the second Hoosier Salon ran for fourteen days at Marshall Field's galleries in Chicago. It featured 339 works by 149 artists and drew more than 50,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; For the first time the show was opened to sculpture in addition to paintings. [[Janet Scudder]], a native of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], who gained an international reputation for her work as a sculptor, earned the $300 merit prize for her outstanding sculpture called ''Victory''. Wayman Adams won the $500 merit prize for the exhibition's outstanding picture, ''The Art Jury'', a life-size portrait of the four surviving members of the Hoosier Group&amp;ndash;Steele, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and Forsyth.&lt;ref name="GT2-3"/&gt; (Steele and Stark died by the end of 1926; J. Ottis Adams died in 1927.)&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; [[William Edouard Scott]], a former student of Stark, was one of the first African American artists to participate in the Hoosier Salon. Scott exhibited ''Lights on a Summer Night'' at the second Hoosier Salon.&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;

===Other events===
In 1926, after the Daughters of Chicago hosted the second exhibition, the group partnered with other art patrons to formally organize the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association, a nonprofit organization that would continue the event and its original mission of recognizing talented Indiana artists. John C. Shaffer, editor and publisher of the ''[[Chicago Evening Post]]'', the ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]'', and newspapers in [[Muncie, Indiana]], and Terre Haute, Indiana, became the Association's first president. Estella King, a native of [[Peru, Indiana]], and chair of the Daughters of Indiana art committee for the first two Hoosier Salons, became the group's executive chairman.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt; In addition to the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association, ongoing sponsors and supporters of the annual Hoosier Salon have included Kappa Kappa Kappa, first connected to the Salon in 1927; Delta Sigma Kappa sorority, a supporter since 1937; and [[Psi Iota Xi]], a sponsor since 1941.&lt;ref name=Shank22&gt;Shank, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT5-22-85&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 5, 22, and 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to hosting the annual Salon during its seventeen-year run in Illinois, the patron’s association opened a year-round gallery on October 15, 1928, in donated space in the ''Chicago Evening Post'' Building on West Wacker Drive.&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT5-22-85/&gt; Art that had appeared in at least one of the Salons could be exhibited and sold at the Chicago gallery. The Association also hosted traveling exhibitions, a tradition that continued over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a brief time the group's Hoosier Program Bureau, which was formed in 1929, helped Hoosier musicians secure public appearances. The offering was discontinued in 1941, when the Salon moved its headquarters to Indianapolis and the group decided to focus on visual arts.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26&gt;Newton, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, not all of the Salon's exhibitions were held in Chicago. In June 1936 the Hoosier Salon held its annual exhibition during the summer months at the [[Lake Wawasee history#Spink Wawasee Hotel|Spink-Wawasee Hotel]] at [[Lake Wawasee]] in Indiana.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank20&gt;Shank, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the Art Department of the Woman's Department Club of Indianapolis sponsored a traveling Hoosier Salon exhibition at the William H. Block Company's department store in downtown Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; Following the success of this event in Indianapolis and continued support from the department store, the Woman's Department Club was instrumental in helping to move the Salon's headquarters and its annual exhibition to Indianapolis in 1942.&lt;ref name=Shank22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this same time several of the early leaders in Chicago began to retire, moved away, or experienced failing health, so it was not unexpected that on June 30, 1941, the Salon's trustees formally voted to approve the move of its headquarters to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana years===
In late 1941 the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association moved into two donated rooms in the State Life Building (also known as the Thomas Building) on Washington Street in Indianapolis. These rooms also served as the Association's art gallery until 1973, when fire destroyed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 20 and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Salon's relocation to Indiana, several new sponsors began their longtime support of the Hoosier Salon. Representatives from the Woman's Department Club and its Art Department, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Psi Iota Xi, and women from the Indiana Federation of Clubs and the Indiana Federation of Art Clubs formed the Hoosier Salon Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the move from Chicago, the Association's next annual Hoosier Salon opened in downtown Indianapolis on January 19, 1942, for a two-week run in the sixth-floor auditorium of the William H. Block Company department store at Market and Illinois Streets.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank20/&gt; The event took place shortly after the bombing at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the war effort "dominated the show."&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; Lillian Alt's ''Men and Guns'' and William A. Eyden Jr.'s ''Steel for Defense'' were among the 261 pieces on display.&lt;ref name=Shank20/&gt; The annual Salon was scaled back during World War II, and the wartime themes that continued for several years frequently outnumbered the usual landscapes, still lifes, and portraits.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;

In 1949 the Hoosier Salon marked its twenty-fifth year, a significant achievement that also achieved national recognition. After the Salon's run in Indianapolis, a special exhibition featuring all 168 pieces from the Indiana show were exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|National Museum of American Art]] in April 1949.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indiana State Society of [[Washington, D.C.]], sponsored two fund-raising events for the Salon's exhibition in Washington, D.C.&amp;mdash;a style show at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] and a dance at the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel|Shoreham Hotel]], where Hoosier songwriter [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and his wife, Ruth, were special guests.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s several artists who had contributed to the first exhibitions in Chicago continued to submit works for the Salons, including Polley, Wheeler, and Wayman Adams, among others. Salons in the 1960s marked the changing times for Hoosier artists with the introduction of new materials, such as prints, metal sculpture, collage, and fewer of the more traditional landscapes of southern Indiana.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23&gt;Shank, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few weeks before the Hoosier Salon's fiftieth anniversary exhibition of 1974, disaster struck. On November 5, 1973, a fire destroyed the Thomas Building, including the Salon's historical materials and 311 paintings. The Association established temporary offices at the back of the William A. Block department store’s auditorium and resumed plans for the annual exhibition. A [[Lilly Endowment]] grant of $5,000 and additional $1,000 contributions from several sponsors allowed the Hoosier Salon to open in January 1974, although the other planned events were cancelled. The Salon's fiftieth anniversary exhibition included 163 pieces from 117 different artists. Goth and William A. Eyden Jr. were honored at the annual event. Both of these artists had contributed art for the original exhibition in 1925.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goth had work accepted for every Salon since 1925; her last Salon entries were in 1975. See Newton and Weiss, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Hoosier Salon exhibition remained at Block's department store in Indianapolis from 1942 to 1977. The event moved to the L. S. Ayres department store in downtown Indianapolis at Meridian and Washington Streets in 1978, and remained there until 1989. From 1990 to 2011 the annual exhibition was held at the Indiana State Museum. In 2012 the exhibition moved to the Indiana Historical Society's Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 71 and 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual juried art exhibition continues to showcase the works of Hoosier artists from all walks of life. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth consecutive annual exhibition.&lt;ref name=IHS-INP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton27&gt;Newton, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1974 the Hoosier Salon purchased the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] Bals-Wocher mansion on Indianapolis's North Delaware Street as the new location for its year-round gallery. Because the nonprofit did not have the funds to operate two galleries, it closed its gallery in the former Indianapolis [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton Hotel]] lobby at Meridian and Ohio Streets in December 1974.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 60 and 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978 the Bals-Wocher mansion proved too costly for the group to maintain, so the Salon sold it and moved its gallery to the Morrison Opera building on Indianapolis's South Meridian Street, where it had been renting office space.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1991 the Association relocated its offices to North College Avenue in Indianapolis's [[Broad Ripple Village, Indianapolis|Broad Ripple Village]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =75th Hoosier Salon Diamond Jubilee Gala Celebration (Invitation)  | publisher =Hoosier Salon | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1999 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | url = | isbn =}}, in the collections of the William H. Smith Memorial Library, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; where it had previously established a year-round gallery.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; The Hoosier Salon operated two other galleries in addition to the one in Broad Ripple. One gallery was at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]; the other at [[Wabash, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank24-25&gt;Shank, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 the Hoosier Salon maintained gallery space at New Harmony, but the Wabash gallery closed and the property owner converted it to another purpose.&lt;ref name=Eason&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Eason | title =Hoosier Salon moving main gallery to Carmel | newspaper =Indianapolis Star | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =2014-04-16 | url = http://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/hamilton-county/2014/04/16/hoosier-salon-moving-main-gallery-carmel/7782609/ | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the annual Hoosier Salon remains the organization's biggest event, it also provides other outreach efforts.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; In 2006 the Hoosier Salon initiated the French tradition of a [[Salon Des Refusés]] (exhibition of rejects) at its Broad Ripple gallery.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt; The Salon also provides educational outreach to schools and collaborates with other organizations to promote the arts.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;

In May 2014 the Hoosier Salon closed its main gallery in Broad Ripple and moved to a new gallery space in the Carmel Arts and Design District in Carmel, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hoosier Salon art gallery opens in Carmel | work = | publisher =Indianapolis Star  | date =2014-05-10 | url = http://www.indystar.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/arts/2014/05/10/hoosier-salon-art-gallery-opens-in-carmel/8955009/| format = | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoosier Salon artists==
Since 1925, many of Indiana's most notable artists have exhibited at the Hoosier Salon. In order to qualify as a Salon exhibitor, an artist must be a Hoosier Salon member and must have lived in Indiana for a minimum of one year at any point during their life. Salon entries are independently reviewed by experienced judges in the art field and selected for the annual exhibition. The works of well-established master artists are displayed alongside the work of newcomers to the field.&lt;ref name=Shank24-25/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieber"&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Lieber  | first = Tammy  | title = Hoosier Salon paints its role in broad strokes  | newspaper = Indianapolis Business Journal  | location = Indianapolis, Indiana  | pages =| language =   | publisher =  | date = September 12, 2005  | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/10575806-1.html  | accessdate = November 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Hoosier Salon claims ties to the Hoosier Group and several members of the Brown County Art Colony.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; However, not all of the Salon's art has Indiana as it subject. Work from Salon artists with Hoosier ties is inspired from locales outside Indiana as well. New York City-based Wayman Adams, born near [[Muncie, Indiana]], exhibited his artwork at the Salon for thirty-five years.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; Several southwestern artists  were linked to Indiana as well. [[Shelbyville, Indiana]], native [[William Victor Higgins]], who was a member of [[New Mexico]]'s "Taos Ten", and [[Gustave Baumann]], who worked in [[Brown County, Indiana]], for seven years before moving to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], in 1918, were Salon exhibitors. [[Fairmount, Indiana]], native [[Olive Rush]], whose art studio was in Santa Fe, was a Salon prizewinner.&lt;ref name=Newton24/&gt;

In the past, Hoosier cartoonists have been well represented at the Salons. In addition to comic-strip illustrator Harold Gray's "Little Orphan Annie", cartoonists who competed for the Salon's prizes and recognition were [[Kin Hubbard|Frank McKinney "Kin" Hubbard]]'s nationally syndicated "Abe Martin" cartoons; [[Gaar Williams]], who created "Among the Folks in History"; [[Fontaine Fox]], creator of the syndicated cartoon"[[Toonerville Folks|Toonerville Trolley]]"; and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [[John T. McCutcheon]], who drew editorial cartoons. Gray, Hubbard, Williams, and McCutcheon also provided artwork to help advertise the Salon.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton24/&gt;

In more recent years Salon entries have changed to reflect the new artistic styles of Hoosier artists. Past Salon works have included Kanwal Prakash (K. P.) Singh's architectural renderings, lithographs from Garo Z. Antreasian, watercolors from Floyd Hopper, portraits by [[Nancy Noel]], the acrylics of James Lee Cunningham, and abstract art from Martha Slaymaker.&lt;ref name=Newton27/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT298&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''instrumental''' is a [[musical composition]] or recording without [[lyrics]], or [[singing]], although it might include some inarticulate [[vocal]]s, such as shouted [[backup vocal]]s in a [[Big Band]] setting. The word "song" is widely misused by people in the popular music industry to describe any musical composition, whether sung or played only by instruments. The [[music]] is primarily or exclusively produced using [[musical instrument]]s. An instrumental can exist in [[music notation]], after it is written by a [[composer]]; in the mind of the [[composer]] (especially in cases where the composer himself will perform the piece, as in the case of a [[blues]] solo guitarist or a [[folk music]] [[fiddle]] player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a [[musical ensemble]], which could range in components from a [[duet|duo]] or [[trio (music)|trio]] to a large [[Big Band]], [[concert band]] or [[orchestra]].

In a [[song]] that is otherwise [[Singing|sung]], a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an '''instrumental interlude''', or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental [[introduction (music)|introduction]]. If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a "solo" (e.g., the [[guitar solo]] that is a key section of [[heavy metal music]] and [[hard rock]] songs). If the instruments are [[percussion instrument]]s, the interlude can be called a [[Break (music)|percussion interlude]] or "percussion break". These interludes are a form of [[Break (music)|break]] in the song.

Modern instrumentals are produced using a [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstation (DAW)]] such as [[FL Studio]], [[Cubase]] and [[Logic Pro]]. These pieces of software allow instrumental music to be composed with ease.

==In popular music==
In commercial [[popular music]], instrumental tracks are sometimes renderings, [[remix]]es of a corresponding release that features vocals, but they may also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A [[blues]] band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include [[electric guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[upright bass]]/[[electric bass]] and [[drum kit]].

==Opposite concept==
The opposite of instrumental music, that is, music for voices alone, without any [[accompaniment]] instruments, is [[a cappella]], an Italian phrase that means "in the chapel". In [[early music]], instruments such as [[trumpet]] and [[drums]] were considered outdoor instruments, and music for inside a chapel typically used quieter instruments, voices, or just voices alone. A capella music exists in both [[Classical music]] [[choir]] pieces (for choir without any [[accompanist]] [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]]) and in popular music styles such as [[doo wop]] groups and [[Barbershop quartet]]s. For [[genre]]s in which a non-vocal song or interlude is conceived using computers and software, rather than with acoustic musical instruments or [[electronic musical instrument]]s, the term instrumental is still used for it.

==Borderline cases==
Some recordings which include brief or non-musical use of the human voice are typically considered instrumentals. Examples include songs with the following:
* Short verbal interjections (as in "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]" or "[[Topsy (instrumental)|Topsy]]" or "[[Wipe Out (instrumental)|Wipe Out]]" or "[[Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]" or "[[Bentley Rhythm Ace (album)|Bentley's Gonna Sort You Out]]")
* Repetitive [[nonsense]] words (e.g., "la la..." (as in "[[Calcutta (song)|Calcutta]]") or "[[Woo-Hoo (Rock-A-Teens song)|Woo Hoo]]")
* Non-musical spoken passages in the background of the track (e.g., "[[To Live Is to Die]]" by [[Metallica]]; "[[Desolation of Eden|Wasteland]]" by [[Chelsea Grin]])
* Wordless vocal effects, such as [[drone (music)|drones]] (e.g., "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" or "[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]")
* [[Vocal percussion]], such as beatbox [[B-sides]] on rap singles
* [[Yodeling]] (e.g., "[[Hocus Pocus (song)|Hocus Pocus]]")
* [[Whistling]] (e.g., "[[I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman]]" or "[[Colonel Bogey March]]")
* Spoken statements at the end of the track (e.g., God Bless the Children of the Beast by [[Mötley Crüe]], [[For the Love of God (instrumental)|For the Love of God]] by [[Steve Vai]])
* Non-musical vocal recordings taken from other media (e.g., "[[Vampires (Godsmack song)|Vampires]]" by [[Godsmack]])
* [[Field recording]]s which may or may not contain non-lyrical words. (e.g., many songs by [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and other [[post-rock]] bands.)

Songs including actual musical—rhythmic, melodic, and lyrical—vocals might still be categorized as instrumentals if the vocals appear only as a short part of an extended piece (e.g., "[[Unchained Melody]]" (Les Baxter), "[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]", "[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]", "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]", "[[Fly, Robin, Fly]]", "[[Get Up and Boogie (song)|Get Up and Boogie]]", "[[Do It Any Way You Wanna]]", and "[[Gonna Fly Now]]"), though this definition is loose and subjective.

Falling just outside of that definition is "[[Theme From Shaft]]" by [[Isaac Hayes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6395">The '''International Federation of Rock Art Organizations (IFRAO)''' is a coordinating body of 57 organizations concerned with prehistoric [[rock art]].  

==History==
The IFRAO was formed in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]] on 3 September 1988, during the first major international academic conference dedicated entirely to the study of prehistoric rock art. Nine rock art organizations formed this international federation of independent national or regional bodies. At the founding meeting, it was decided that IFRAO should be a common forum and initiator of policies, projecting or representing the common interests of member organizations without interfering in their autonomy. It would operate as a democratic advisory body in which each member organization would hold one vote, exercised by an official representative. International meetings would be held by nominating suitable rock art conferences as official IFRAO congresses at regular intervals. 

Over the subsequent twelve years, the number of affiliate members quadrupled to almost 40, and the current 57 members of IFRAO cover most of the world. The combined memberships of these organizations include about 9,000 rock art specialists, which is practically all such specialists in the world. 

Until the late 1980s, individual rock art researchers as well as rock art organizations around the world operated largely without being aware of the work conducted in other parts of the world — sometimes even in their own country or region of activity. As a result, the discipline experienced a great diversity of research approaches and terminology, reflected in a multitude of idiosyncratic constructs, sequences, chronologies, names and definitions. Therefore, one of IFRAO’s initial principal concerns was the [[standardization]] of those aspects of the discipline that are essential for effective communication and collaboration: [[methodology]], [[terminology]], [[ethics]], and the [[technical standards]] used in analysis and recording. These subjects were addressed through extensive consultation of specialists and, where appropriate, the deliberations of appointed subcommittees.

==Objectives==
The IFRAO members produce about twenty specialist periodicals, whose flagship is ''[[Rock Art Research]]'', the official organ of the federation. IFRAO has been particularly effective in the area of rock art protection and preservation, achieving sometimes spectacular successes, such as the electoral defeat of recalcitrant Portuguese governments in 1995 and 2002. Subsequently IFRAO secured the preservation and return to Aborigines of the reputedly largest rock art gallery in the world, in the Dampier Archipelago of Western Australia, against bitter opposition from the State Government and 18 multinational companies. Thus the federation has become the principal international body pursuing the conservation of prehistoric rock art effectively. Another of its greatest achievements to date has been its successful campaign of empowering traditional indigenous societies to secure the return of rock art sites into their care and possession.

'''Jacob Marrel''' (1613/1614 – 11 November 1681) was a German [[still life]] painter active in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] during the [[Dutch Golden Age]].

==Biography==
[[File:Jacob marrel - two tulips.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob Marrel: ''Two tulips, a shell and an insect'', 1634]]
Jacob Marrel was born in [[Frankenthal]]. He moved with his family in 1624 to Frankfurt, where he became a student of [[Georg Flegel]] in 1627. Attracted by the high prices for flower still life paintings, Marrel studied from 1632-1650&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/52795 Jacob Marrel] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Jan Davidszoon de Heem]] in [[Utrecht (city)]], before returning to Frankfurt, where he married Johanna Sybilla Heim(ius), the widow of [[Matthäus Merian]], who died in 1650. He took on students, and his wife's daughter [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] became a renowned painter of flowers and insects, rivalling [[Rachel Ruysch]] as a female artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0385.htm Maria Sybille Merian biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; She later married one of his pupils, [[Johann Andreas Graff]], in 1665, after a 6-year tour he made to Venice and Rome upon completion of his studies under Marrel.&lt;ref name=RKD /&gt;

In 1660 Marrel spent another period in Utrecht, with his student [[Abraham Mignon]], who married and settled there. This is presumably the period in which Maria Sibylla Merian was introduced to Dutch flower painting. In 1665 Marrel returned to Germany, attending the wedding of his step-daughter in [[Nuremberg]] and in Frankfurt establishing a school of his own in flower painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_artists/00018493?lang=nl Jacob Marrel] at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]], retrieved 30-aug-09&lt;/ref&gt; He was active as an art dealer in Utrecht until 1669.&lt;ref name=RKD /&gt; He died in [[Frankfurt]].

He signed his work with ''Jacobus Marrellus Fecit''.

'''Javanshir Fortress''' is a defensive fortress located located 4 km north of the village of [[Talıstan|Talystan]] in the Ismayilli region, on the right bank of Aghcachay.&lt;ref name="azertag"/&gt; The castle was built by the ruler [[Javanshir]] during the reign of Mehranids dynasty in the Caucasus Albania. The fortress is named after him. It is believed that the fortress was used as an administrative center.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

==Structure==
The fortress was constructed of [[Lime (material)|lime]] and river stones. The area of the fortress is about 1.5 – 2 hectares. It consists of fortress and an inner fortress called Naringala. It is surrounded by valley of the Agchay river from three sides. The complex consists of the main part and Ichgala. The polygonal shaped Ichgala was built on the highest point of the mountain. In most places only basis of it remains. The walls of the Ichgala are demolished. Thickness of the southern wall of the main portion is 2 meters and its height is more than 10 meters. The western walls were completely destroyed by landslides. The defense complex includes 6 towers and their height are up to 8 meters.&lt;ref name="azertag"&gt;{{cite web|title= Cavanşir qalası |url= http://portal.azertag.az/az/node/2031|publisher= portal.azertag.az |language= az|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the northern end of the tower there is a wall with a width of 2 meters and a ledge length of 50 meters. The wall is completed with a cylinder-shaped tower. The entrance to the castle was only from the southern side. There was a gate place with 2.5 m width. There were comb-shaped [[merlon]]s about 0.5 m from each other on top of the walls. Tower was built to strengthen walls of the castle.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Cavanşir qalası (İsmayıllı) |url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/defensive-structure/8d4e3bf2d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az |language= az|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichgala is in the northern part of the fortress. Towers are four-cornered on the south, and rounded on other sides. Some of their diameters reach 8 meters. The main surveillance point is located at the northern end of the fortress. There used to be a hidden path on the north-eastern side of the fortress. This gave opportunity to the fortress to communicate with outside during a blockade.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

'''John Champlin Gardner Jr.''' (July 21, 1933 – September 14, 1982) was an American novelist, essayist, literary critic and university professor. He is best known for his 1971 novel ''[[Grendel (novel)|Grendel]]'', a retelling of the [[Beowulf]] myth from the monster's point of view.

==Early life and education==
Gardner was born in [[Batavia, New York]]. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught English at a local school. Both parents were fond of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and often recited literature together.  He was active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank. As a child, Gardner attended public school and worked on his father's farm, where, in April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a [[cultipacker]].  Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother's death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks.  The incident informed much of Gardner's fiction and criticism — most directly in the 1977 short story "Redemption," which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Allan Chavkin | title = Conversations with John Gardner | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-87805-422-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner began his university education at [[DePauw University]], but received his undergraduate degree from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1955. He received his [[M.A.]] (1956) and [[Ph.D.]] (1958) from the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name=pabook&gt;[http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Gardner__John.html Gardner, John Champlin, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127221427/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Gardner__John.html |date=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Detroit]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesee.edu/gcc/gardner/ John C. Gardner Appreciation Page ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910132708/http://www.genesee.edu/gcc/gardner/ |date=2010-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Gardner's best-known novels include ''[[The Sunlight Dialogues]]'', about a disaffected policeman asked to engage a madman fluent in classical mythology; ''[[Grendel (novel)|Grendel]]'', a retelling of the [[Beowulf]] legend from the monster's point of view, with an existential subtext; and ''October Light'', about an embittered brother and sister living and feuding with each other in rural Vermont (the novel includes an invented "trashy novel" the woman reads). This last book won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionawardwinners.com/reviews.cfm?id=277 October Light - Fiction Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and controversies==
Gardner was a lifelong teacher of fiction writing.  He was a favorite at the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]].&lt;ref name=genesee&gt;[http://www.hollandlandoffice.com/06jg.html The Twenty - Five Things That Made Genesee County Famous: John Gardner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303050828/http://www.hollandlandoffice.com/06jg.html |date=2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His two books on the craft of writing fiction—''The Art of Fiction'' and ''On Becoming a Novelist''—are considered classics{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.  He was famously obsessive with his work, and acquired a reputation for advanced craft, smooth rhythms, and careful attention to the continuity of the fictive dream.  His books nearly always touched on the redemptive power of art.

In 1978, Gardner's book of literary criticism, ''[[On Moral Fiction]]'', sparked a controversy that excited the mainstream media, vaulting Gardner into the spotlight with an interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' (May 16, 1978) and a cover story in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (July, 1979).&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/john-gardner-pugilist-at-rest/ John Gardner, Pugilist at Rest]&lt;/ref&gt;  His judgments of contemporary authors—including such luminaries of American fiction as [[John Updike]] and [[John Barth]]—which could be termed either direct, courageous, or unflattering, depending on one's perspective—harmed his reputation among fellow writers and book reviewers. Gardner claimed that lingering animosity from critics of this book led to unflattering  reviews of what turned out to be his last finished novel, ''[[Mickelsson's Ghosts]]'', although literary critics later praised the book. What was seemingly lost in the furor over ''[[On Moral Fiction]]'' was Gardner's central thesis: that fiction should distinguish right from wrong.

[[Gore Vidal]] found the book, as well as Gardner's novels, sanctimonious and pedantic, and called Gardner the "late apostle to the lowbrows, a sort of Christian evangelical who saw Heaven as a paradigmatic American university."&lt;ref&gt;Vidal, Gore (1986) [http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/1000/vidal/essay.html "Calvino's Death."] From ''The Essential Gore Vidal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner inspired and, according to [[Raymond Carver]], sometimes intimidated his students. At [[Chico State College]] (where he taught from 1959 to 1962), when Carver mentioned to Gardner that he had not liked the assigned short story, [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s "Blackberry Winter," Gardner said, "You'd better read it again."  "And he wasn't joking", said Carver, who related this anecdote in his foreword to Gardner's book ''On Becoming a Novelist''.  In that foreword, he makes it clear how much he respected Gardner and also relates his kindness as a writing mentor.

In addition to Chico State, Gardner taught at [[Oberlin College]] (1958-1959), [[San Francisco State College]] (1962-1965), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (1965-1974) and [[Binghamton University]] (1976-1982).&lt;ref name=genesee/&gt;

==Scholarship==
In 1977, Gardner published ''The Life and Times of Chaucer''.  In a review in the October 1977 issue of ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Sumner J. Ferris pointed to several passages that were allegedly lifted either in whole or in part from work by other authors without proper citation.  Ferris charitably suggested that Gardner had published the book too hastily, but on April 10, 1978, reviewer [[Peter S. Prescott|Peter Prescott]], writing in ''[[Newsweek]]'', cited the ''Speculum'' article and accused Gardner of [[plagiarism]], a claim that Gardner met "with a sigh."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3394/the-art-of-fiction-no-73-john-gardner John Gardner, The Art of Fiction No. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of the famous saying : "There are only two plots in all literature : a person goes on a journey, a stranger comes to town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/05/06/two-plots/|title=There Are Only Two Plots: (1) A Person Goes on a Journey (2) A Stranger Comes to Town {{!}} Quote Investigator|last=garson|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health problems==
On December 10, 1977, Gardner was hospitalized with [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].  He remained in [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] for about a month and a half. He struggled with substance abuse (alcoholism and smoking) late in his life.

==Family life==
Gardner married Joan Louise Patterson on June 6, 1953; the marriage, which produced children, ended in divorce in 1980.&lt;ref name=genesee/&gt;  Gardner married poet and novelist [[Liz Rosenberg]] in 1980, but this marriage also ended in divorce in 1982.&lt;ref name=pabook/&gt;

==Death==
Gardner was killed in a motorcycle accident about two miles from his home in [[Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] on Tuesday, September 14, 1982. [[Pennsylvania State Police|State Police]] said that at about 2:30 pm Gardner completed a curve on [[Pennsylvania Route 92|Route 92]] about {{Convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Oakland, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Oakland]] (41.986246, -75.601200). Passing the home of photographer John Wood, he lost control of his 1979 [[Harley-Davidson]], went into the dirt shoulder, struck the guard rail, and was thrown from the motorcycle, suffering blunt force trauma to his body from his handlebars. He was pronounced dead at Barnes-Kasson Hospital in Susquehanna.&lt;ref name= Schenectady1982&gt;{{Citation |title= John Gardner Killed on His Motorcycle  |author= [[United Press International]] |location= [[Oakland, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Oakland, Pennsylvania]] |newspaper= [[Schenectady Gazette]] |date= 15 September 1982 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EQwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2070,4056176 |accessdate= 2010-09-03 |page= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StPetersberg1982&gt;{{Citation |title= Novelist Gardner dies in crash |author= [[Associated Press]] |location= [[Binghamton, New York]] |newspaper= [[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date= September 15, 1982 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BWkaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2ykEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6948,3651651 |accessdate= 2010-11-09 |pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's fiancée, Susan Thornton, stated that Gardner had been drinking the night before the accident.&lt;ref name=Thornton2000&gt;Thornton, Susan.

'''The Kraków Dance Theatre''' ('''''Krakowski Teatr Tańca''''') is a [[Contemporary dance|dance theatre]] that evolved in 2008 from the GRUPAboso Dance Theatre (founded in 1996) and works under the artistic direction of Eryk Makohon at the Nowa Huta Centre of Culture in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]].

In 2008 the Krakowski Teatr Tańca GRUPAboso Association was established, whose aim is to support the artistic and educational activities of the Theatre.

In 2010 the METAphysical Laboratory was established as the source of new [[dancer]]s. The students-dancers of the Laboratory have become the guest dancers of the Theatre and they have an opportunity to create their own [[Choreography|choreographies]] with a professional support.

Some of the company's awards were won at: the Tychy Theatre Meetings (2007, 2009), the Polish Contemporary Dance Confrontation in [[Konin]] (2009), the Polish edition of the Solo &amp; Duo Dance Festival (2009 and 2010). Additionally, the company represented Poland at the 13th Biennial of Young Artists from [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]], which took place in May 2008 in [[Bari]] ([[Italy]]).

'''{{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}''' ("The Origin of the World") is a picture painted in oil on canvas by the French artist [[Gustave Courbet]] in 1866. It is a close-up view of the [[genitals]] and [[abdomen]] of a naked woman, lying on a bed with legs spread. The framing of the nude body, with head, arms and lower legs outside of view, emphasizes the [[eroticism]] of the work.

== History ==
=== Identity of the model ===
[[File:The Origin of the World (upper section).jpg|thumb|Putative upper section of ''L'Origine du monde'']]
Art historians have speculated for years that Courbet's model for {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} was his favourite model, [[Joanna Hiffernan]], also known as ''Jo''. Her lover at the time was the American painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], a friend of Courbet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/25/joanna-hiffernan-courbet-nude-lorigine-du-monde |title=Who posed for the 'Mona Lisa of vaginas'? |last=Jones |first=Jonathan |author-link=Jonathan Jones (journalist) |date=25 September 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gustave Courbet - Jo, la belle Irlandaise (MET-Museum).jpg|thumb|''La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo)'' by Courbet: Joanna Hiffernan, possible model for ''L'Origine du monde'']]
Hiffernan was the subject of a series of four portaits by Courbet entitled [[Jo, the Beautiful Irishwoman|''La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo)'']] painted in 1865-66. The possibility that she was the model for {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}&lt;ref name=tele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Benoit|last1=Noël|first2=Jean|last2=Hournon|title=Parisiana – La capitale des peintres au XIX&lt;sup&gt;ème&lt;/sup&gt; siècle|publisher=Les Presses Franciliennes|chapter=Gustave Courbet – L'Origine du Monde, 1866|page=37|isbn=9782952721400|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that she was having an affair with Courbet might explain Courbet's and Whistler's brutal separation a short while later.&lt;ref name=Kosinski&gt;Dorothy M. Kosinski, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1483342 Gustave Courbet's ''The Sleepers.'' The Lesbian Image in Nineteenth Century French Art and Literature], Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 9, No. 18  (1988), p.187&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Hiffernan's [[red hair]] contrasting with the darker pubic hair of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}, the hypothesis that Hiffernan was the model continues. Redhead Jacky Colliss Harvey puts forward the idea that the woman's body-hair suggests a more obvious candidate might be the brunette painted with Hiffernan in Courbet's ''[[Le Sommeil]]''; and that the identification with Hiffernan has been greatly influenced by the eroticised and sexualised image of the female redhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = RED: A History of the Redhead|last = Colliss Harvey|first = Jacky|publisher = Black Dog &amp; Leventhal|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-57912-996-5|location = New York|pages = 119-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Melle Queniaux opéra (ballet) par Nadar (1820-1910).jpg|thumb|left|Constance Quéniaux, possible model for ''L'Origine du monde'']]
In February 2013, ''[[Paris Match]]'' reported that Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fernier had authenticated a painting of a young woman's head and shoulders as the upper section of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} which according to some was severed from the original work. Fernier has stated that because of the conclusions reached after two years of analysis, the head will be added to the next edition of the Courbet [[catalogue raisonné]].&lt;ref name=tele&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9854914/Amateur-art-buff-finds-35-million-head-of-Courbet-masterpiece.html "Amateur art buff finds £35 million head of Courbet masterpiece"] by Henry Samuel, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Paris Match]]|title=''L'Origine du monde'': Le secret de la femme cachée|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Culture-Match/Art/Actu/L-Origine-du-monde-de-Gustave-Courbet-Le-secret-de-la-femme-cachee-463132/|date=7 February 2013|language=French|access-date=2013-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415141855/http://www.parismatch.com/Culture-Match/Art/Actu/L-Origine-du-monde-de-Gustave-Courbet-Le-secret-de-la-femme-cachee-463132/|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Musée d'Orsay]] has indicated that ''L'Origine du monde'' was not part of a larger work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/9860793/Has-the-head-of-The-Origin-of-the-World-been-found.html|title=Has the head of The Origin of the World been found? |work= The Telegraph|date=10 February 2013|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that "experts at the [French] art research centre CARAA (Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Archéologie) were able to align the two paintings via grooves made by the original wooden frame and lines in the canvas itself, whose grain matched."&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; According to CARAA, it performed pigment analyses which were identified as classical pigments of the 2nd half of the 19th century. No other conclusions were reported by the CARAA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caraa.fr/EN/detail-actu.php?actu=18 "Summary of analytical report – Painting on canvas, portrait of a woman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217201825/http://www.caraa.fr/EN/detail-actu.php?actu=18 |date=2015-02-17 }}, Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Archéologie, 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The claim reported by ''Paris Match'' was characterized as dubious by ''[[Le Monde]]'' art critic [[Philippe Dagen]], indicating differences in style, and that canvas-similarities could be caused by buying from the same shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2013/0209/1224329840770.html|title=Art collector claims to have found top part of Courbet's ''Origin of the World''|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=11 February 2013|date=9 February 2013|author=Ruadhán Mac Cormaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary evidence however links the painting with [[Constance Quéniaux]], a former dancer at the [[Paris Opera]] and a mistress of the Ottoman diplomat [[Halil Şerif Pasha]] (Khalil Bey) who commisioned the painting. According to the historian Claude Schopp and the head of the [[French National Library]]'s prints department, Sylvie Aubenas, the evidence is found in correspondence between [[Alexandre Dumas fils]] and [[George Sand]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/25/origin-of-gustave-courbet-scandalous-painting-revealed |title=Mystery solved? Identity of Courbet's 19th-century nude revealed |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |location=Paris |date=2018-09-25 |website=the Guardian |language=en |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential model was [[Marie-Anne Detourbay]], who also was a mistress of Halil Şerif Pasha.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

=== Owners ===
Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) is believed to have commissioned the work shortly after he moved to Paris. [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] introduced him to Courbet and he ordered a painting to add to his personal collection of erotic pictures, which already included {{Lang|fr|[[The Turkish Bath|Le Bain turc]]}} (''The Turkish Bath'') from [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and another painting by Courbet, ''[[Le Sommeil]]'' (''The Sleepers''), for which it is supposed that Hiffernan was one of the models.
[[File:Halil Sherif Pasha.jpg|thumbnail|left|Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) commissioned the painting.]]
After Khalil Bey's finances were ruined by gambling, the painting subsequently passed through a series of private collections. It was first bought during the sale of the Khalil Bey collection in 1868, by antique dealer Antoine de la Narde. [[Edmond de Goncourt]] hit upon it in an antique shop in 1889, hidden behind a wooden pane decorated with the painting of a castle or a church in a snowy landscape. According to [[Robert Fernier]], who published two volumes of the Courbet catalogue raisonné and founded the [[Musée Courbet]], Hungarian collector Baron [[Ferenc Hatvany]] bought it at the [[Bernheim-Jeune]] gallery in 1910 and took it with him to Budapest. Towards the end of the [[Second World War]] the painting was looted by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]], but later ransomed by Hatvany. Hatvany left Hungary, which was on the brink of a Communist takeover, in 1947. He was allowed to take only one art work with him, and he took {{Lang|fr|L'Origine}} to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2008/02/01/the-mysterious-journey-of-an-erotic-masterpiece/ "The Mysterious Journey of an Erotic Masterpiece"] by Konstantin Akinsha, ''[[ARTnews]]'', 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs, about 4,285 US dollars at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/exchangeglobal/result.php?year_source=1955&amp;year_result=1955&amp;countryE%5B%5D=France|title=Measuring Worth - Relative Worth Comparators and Data Sets|website=www.measuringworth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its new owner was the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. He and his wife, actress [[Sylvia Bataille]], installed it in their country house in [[Guitrancourt]]. Lacan asked [[André Masson]], his stepbrother, to build a double bottom frame and draw another picture thereon. Masson painted a surrealist, allusive version of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Lacan and the Matter of Origins'' by Shuli Barzilai, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/courbet.htm|title=courbet - origin of the world|website=www.lacan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York public had the opportunity to view {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} in 1988 during the ''Courbet Reconsidered'' show at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]; the painting was also included in the exhibition ''Gustave Courbet'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 2008. After Lacan died in 1981, the French Minister of Economy and Finances agreed to settle the family's [[inheritance tax]] bill through the transfer of the work ({{Lang|fr|[[Acceptance in lieu|"Dation en paiement"]]}} in French law) to the [[Musée d'Orsay]]; the transfer was finalized in 1995.

=== Provocative work ===
During the 19th century, the display of the nude body underwent a revolution whose main activists were Courbet and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. Courbet rejected academic painting and its smooth, idealised nudes, but he also directly recriminated the hypocritical social conventions of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], where [[eroticism]] and even [[pornography]] were acceptable in [[mythology|mythological]] or [[oneiric]] paintings.

Courbet later insisted he never lied in his paintings, and his [[realism (arts)|realism]] pushed the limits of what was considered presentable. With {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}, he has made even more explicit the eroticism of Manet's ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]''. [[Maxime Du Camp]], in a harsh tirade, reported his visit to the work's purchaser, and his sight of a painting "giving realism's last word".{{sfn|Du Camp|1878|p=190}}

[[File:Courbet-origine-monde.jpg|thumb|{{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} in the {{Lang|fr|Musée d'Orsay}}]]
By the very nature of its realistic, graphic nudity, the painting still has the power to shock and triggers censorship.

Although moral standards and resulting taboos regarding the artistic display of nudity have changed since Courbet, owing especially to [[photography]] and [[film|cinema]], the painting remained provocative. Its arrival at the Musée d'Orsay caused high excitement. According to postcard sales, {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} is the second most popular painting in the Musée d'Orsay, after [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir's]] ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/arts_and_commentary/article759415.ece|title=The history of ''The Origin of the World''| location=London|work=The Times Literary Supplement|first=Mark|last=Hutchinson|date=8 August 2007}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics maintain that the body depicted is not (as has been argued) a lively erotic portray of a female but of a corpse: "''L’Origine'' does not represent a full female body but rather a slice of one, cut off by the frame [...]. The pallidness of the skin and the mortuary gauze surrounding the body suggest death."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|p=95}}

== Influence ==
The explicitness of the picture may have served as an inspiration, albeit with a satirical twist, for [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s last major work, ''[[Étant donnés]]'' (1946–1966), a construction also featuring the image of a woman lying on her back with her legs spread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toutfait.com/femalic-molds/ "Femalic Molds"], The Marcel Duchamp Studies Online Journal (toutfait.com), 1 April 2003/5 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, French artist [[Orlan]] created the [[cibachrome]] ''L'origine de la guerre'' (''The Origin of War''), a male version of ''L'origine du monde'' showing a [[penile erection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loeildelaphotographie.com/2013/11/27/exhibition/23329/orlan-l-origine-de-la-guerre-orsay-masculin-masculin |title=ORLAN: L’origine de la Guerre |last= |first= |date= |website=The Eye of Photography |publisher= |access-date=2018-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1994, the novel {{Lang|fr|Adorations perpétuelles}} (''Perpetual Adorations'') by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Henric|fr}} reproduced {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} on its cover. Police visited several French bookshops to have them withdraw the book from their windows. A few proprietors maintained the book, but others complied, and some voluntarily removed it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Brazilian artist [[Vik Muniz]] created two versions of the famous painting. "The first [1999] is a photograph made of dust or dirt, which plays with the common moralist association between female genitalia and filth. In the second piece [2013], Muniz remakes ''L’Origine'' from an assemblage of journal clippings that are reminiscent of the anatomic and artistic procedure of cutting that produced [...] the female body."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|pp=103-105}}

''Two Origins of the World'' (2000) by Mexican artist [[Enrique Chagoya]] "recycles ''L’Origine du monde'' as a spectral backdrop behind three solid black, blue and white squares of canvas in three of the corners of the painting. In the foreground of the bottom right corner, an indigenous man sits at a fourth canvas, this one on an easel, apparently 'interpreting' the Courbet painting."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|p=105}}

In 2002, American artist [[Jack Daws]] created an homage to the painting. Entitled ''Origins of the World'', it is a collection of various photographs of vulvas, taken from pornographic magazines, and framed in montage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gregkucera.com/daws_sculpture.htm |title=Jack Daws Sculpture |website=Greg Kucera Gallery, Inc. |publisher= |access-date=2018-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British artist [[Anish Kapoor]] created an installation in 2004 called ''L'Origine du monde'', which references Courbet's painting. The piece is in the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanazawa21.jp/data_list.php?g=97&amp;d=78&amp;lng=e|title=金沢21世紀美術館|website=金沢21世紀美術館}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image is also referenced as inspiring [[Catherine Breillat]]'s filming of the female genitalia in her 2004 film {{Lang|fr|Anatomie de l'enfer}} (''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/Catherine%20BREILLAT/breillat_interview.html "Catherine Breillat, cinéaste"] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004064647/http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/Catherine%20BREILLAT/breillat_interview.html |date=2009-10-04 }}, interview by Laurent Devanne, [[Radio libertaire]] (1 February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian [[performance art]]ist [[Tanja Ostojić]] parodied the work in a poster in 2005, informally called the "EU panties" poster. Like Courbet's painting, the poster proved controversial, and was ultimately removed from the art exhibition in which it was originally displayed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On February 23, 2009 in [[Braga]], Portugal, [[Polícia de Segurança Pública|the police]] confiscated the book ''Pornocratie'' by Catherine Breillat, displayed in bookshops using {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} as its cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great deal of controversy was sparked by the police action. The reason given was the need to maintain public order. Also, the book title incorrectly hinted at pornographic content. Portuguese law forbids public displays of pornography.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 2010, British composer [[Tony Hymas]] composed {{Lang|fr|De l'origine du monde}} a [[Suite (music)|musical suite]] dedicated to the picture as well as relations between Courbet and the [[Paris Commune]], based on texts by Courbet himself, [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Pierre Dupont]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In February 2011, [[Facebook]] censored {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} after it was posted by Copenhagen-based artist Frode Steinicke, to illustrate his comments about a television program aired on DR2. Following the incident, many other Facebook users defiantly changed their profile pictures to the Courbet painting in an act of solidarity with Steinicke. Facebook, which originally disabled Steinicke's profile, finally re-enabled it without the {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} picture. As the case won media attention, Facebook deleted other pages about the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Greenberg [http://cornellsun.com/node/46245 "Facebook, Censorship and Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105104721/http://cornellsun.com/node/46245 |date=2011-11-05 }}, ''Cornell Daily Sun'', 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dépêche AFP du 17/02/10 [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvF1OWi_2s8sEFr2VEnAUYozmU0g?docId=CNG.9ddadf8072b82cd68b8e61e1dcc3a108.7e1 "''L'Origine du monde'' de Courbet interdit de Facebook pour cause de nudité"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, again, a complaint was lodged against Facebook with the [[Tribunal de grande instance de Paris]] (Paris court of general jurisdiction) by a French Facebook user after his profile was disabled for showing a picture of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}. The picture was a link to a television program aired on [[Arte]] about the history of the painting. As he got no answer to his emails to Facebook, he decided to lodge a complaint for "infringement of freedom of expression" and against the legality of Facebook's terms which define the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, as the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all litigating claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/l-origine-du-monde-assigne-facebook-en-justice-24-10-2011-1388626_3.php "''L'Origine du monde'' assigne Facebook en justice"], ''[[Le Point]]'', 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the Paris court ruled that Facebook could be sued in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/facebook-faces-trial-in-france-over-nudity-censorship-case-a6871791.html "Facebook in landmark censorship case after banning French user who posted naked artwork" ''The Independent'' 13 February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German-born Turkish artist [[Taner Ceylan]] has painted a work named ''1879 (From the Lost Paintings Series)'' (2011) in which a veiled Ottoman noblewoman stands before the framed canvas of ''L'Origine du monde''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Garreth|title=Up front and personal: Turkish artist Taner Ceylan|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d14ba7c-2d23-11e4-8105-00144feabdc0|accessdate=4 October 2017|work=Financial Times|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taner Ceylan 1879 (FROM THE LOST PAINTING SERIES)|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/contemporary-art-turkish-l11221/lot.14.html|publisher=Sothebys|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2014, a Luxembourg performance artist, [[Deborah De Robertis]], sat on the floor in front of the painting and mimicked the view of the subject. This resulted in security guards closing the room and her arrest.{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|pp=82-83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artist-arrested-again-for-nude-stunt-in-front-of-manets-olympia-in-paris-gallery-a6819886.html|title=An artist has been arrested (again) for a nude stunt in a Paris gallery|date=18 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US artist [[Candice Lin]] recreated ''L’Origine du monde'' in a video of her an audiovisual sculpture ''Hunter Moon / Inside Out'' (2015). In it, ''Courbet’s L’Origine du monde with eyes'' "looks back at the onlookers." From a feminist point of view, Lin's work challenges "the asymmetry of power [...] between those who look and those who are seen."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|p=85}}

'''Lena Söderberg''', born '''Sjööblom''' (born 31 March 1951) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] model who appeared as a [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] in the November 1972 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date = November 1972 |title = Playmate of the Month |journal = Playboy Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Lenna Sjööblom'''. Her [[centerfold]] was photographed by [[Dwight Hooker]].

A head and shoulder section of her centerfold, this cropped section itself known as [[Lenna]], is often used to test algorithms in [[digital image processing]].&lt;ref name=JH&gt;Jamie Hutchison, [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf "Culture, Communication, and an Information Age Madonna"], ''IEEE Professional Communication Society Newsletter'' Vol. 45, No. 3, May/June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the [[Society for Imaging Science and Technology]] in 1997, where she gave a presentation about herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml Imaging Experts Meet Lenna in Person].&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the ubiquity of her ''Playboy'' photo scan, she has been called the "first lady of the internet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19260550 BBC News].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/playboy_backups/lena.html |title=Playboy Newsdesk - Lena |newspaper=Cs.cmu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was given to her by Jeff Seideman in a press release he issued announcing her appearance at the 50th annual IS&amp;T Conference.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''''Leonidas''''' is a sculpture of [[hoplite]] made of [[Parian marble]] in 480–470 BC and unearthed in 1926. The sculpture was dubbed "Leonidas" by a local Greek workman after its discovery, in reference to [[Sparta]]n king [[Leonidas I]].&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;{{cite book | author=Paul Cartledge| title =Thermopylae: The Battle That Changed the World| publisher =The Overlook Press| year =2006| page =&lt;!-- not numbered --&gt;| isbn =1590208404}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found southwest of [[peribolos]] of the sanctuary of [[Athena Chalkioikos]] on the [[Acropolis of Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.onassis.org/uploaded/EVENTS/Press-release-Athens-Sparta_en.pdf|title=New York, USA. "Athens-Sparta: from the 8th to the 5th Centuries B.C." – Exhibition 
|publisher=Onassis.org| accessdate =17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is housed in the [[Archaeological Museum of Sparta]] which acquired it from the [[British School at Athens]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://museum.classics.cam.ac.uk/collections/casts/leonidas|title="Leonidas"|publisher=University of Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology Databases|accessdate =17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture features a [[Corinthian helmet]] with ram-shaped cheek pieces. While most of the plume is a restoration, fragments of a leg, foot, shield and helmet were also found nearby.&lt;ref name="cam"/&gt; 

The sculpture was part of a group, probably affixed to the sanctuary pediment. According to several scholars, it formed part of the memorial on the Spartan acropolis to honor Leonidas on his reburial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nic Fields| title =Thermopylae 480 BC| publisher =Osprey Publishing| year =2007| page =32| isbn =978 184176 180 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Cartledge]], however, argued it would have represented a mythical hero or a god rather than the historical person of Leonidas.&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt; One estimation dates the sculpture before rather than after 480 BC, the year of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] where Leonidas died.&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt;

The '''Mogao Caves''', also known as the '''Thousand Buddha Grottoes''' or '''Caves of the Thousand Buddhas''', form a system of 492 temples {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the center of [[Dunhuang]], an oasis strategically located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the [[Silk Road]], in [[Gansu]] province, China. The caves may also be known as the '''Dunhuang Caves''', however, this term is also used as a collective term to include other Buddhist cave sites in and around the Dunhuang area, such as the [[Western Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Yulin Caves]], and [[Five Temple Caves]]. The caves contain some of the finest examples of [[Buddhist art]] spanning a period of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/440
|title=Mogao Caves
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=2007-08-05
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The first caves were dug out in 366 AD as places of Buddhist meditation and worship.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Wengin&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are the best known of the [[China|Chinese]] Buddhist grottoes and, along with [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], are one of the three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China.

An important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called "Library Cave", which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The contents of the library were subsequently dispersed around the world, and the largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the [[International Dunhuang Project]] exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, with a number open for visiting.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Makinen, Julie (September 27, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-mogao-grottoes-buddhist-caves-dunhuang-20140928-story.html "Getty Institute helps save China's Mogao Grottoes from tourism's impact"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The caves are commonly referred to in Chinese as the Thousand Buddha Caves ({{zh|c=千佛洞|p=qiānfó dòng}}), a name that some scholars have speculated to have come from the legend of its founding, when a monk Yuezun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas at the site.  This name however may have come from the large number of Buddha figures at the site, or the miniatures figures painted on the walls of these caves as these figures are called "thousand Buddhas" colloquially.{{sfn|Chung|1994|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} The name Mogao Caves ({{zh|c={{linktext|莫高窟}}|p= Mògāo kū}}) was used in the Tang dynasty, where 'Mogao' refers to an administrative district at the site during the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger|page=242 |publisher=Routledge|date=13 June 1996|isbn= 978-1884964046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao may mean  "peerless" (literally "none higher", where "''mo''" means "none", and "''gao''" means "high");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/13/dunhuang-caves-artifacts-ancient-history-chinese-civilization-getty-institute-silk-road-los-angeles |title=Artifacts from ancient Chinese cave temples head west for California exhibit |first=Jordan |last=Riefe|date=13 May 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWmmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cave Temples of Mogao at Dunhuang: Art History on the Silk Road: Second Edition |authors= Roderick Whitfield, Susan Whitfield, Neville Agnew |page=55 |publisher=Getty Publications|edition= 2nd |date=29 September 2015|isbn= 978-1606064450}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative reading may be "high in the desert" if "mo" is read as a variant of the Chinese term for "desert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6wmQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mogao+desert+high&amp;q=mo+desert+high |title=Frescoes and Fables: Mural Stories from the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang|first=Naomi |last=McPherson |publisher=New World Press|date= 1998|page=14 |isbn=9787800054006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao is also used as the name of a modern town that is administered by [[Dunhuang]] city: Mogao Town ({{linktext|莫高|镇}}).&lt;ref name="xzqhdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/gs/30392.html |script-title=zh:敦煌市历史沿革 |trans-title=Dunhuang City Historical Development |publisher=XZQH.org |language=Simplified Chinese |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statsdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/tjyqhdmhcxhfdm/2016/62/09/620982.html |title=2016年统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码：敦煌市 |trans-title=2016 Statistical Area Numbers and Rural-Urban Area Numbers: Duhuang City |language=zh-hans |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] |date=2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are also often referred to as the Dunhuang Caves after the nearest city [[Dunhuang]], which means "blazing beacon" as beacons were used  at the frontier outpost to warn of attacks by nomadic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HDBZDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Cave Temples of Dunhuang |isbn=9781606064894 |author1=Agnew |first1=Neville |last2=Reed |first2=Marcia |last3=Ball |first3=Tevvy |date=2016-05-07 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Dunhuang Caves however is also used in a broader sense as a collective term for all the caves found in or around the Dunhuang area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIa9sere_8C&amp;pg=PA427#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Eighteen Lectures on Dunhuang |first= Xinjiang |last=Rong |page=427 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=9789004252332 |date=2013-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dunhuang Mogao cave 159.jpg|thumb|left|Details of painting of the meeting of [[Manjusri]] and [[Vimalakirti]]. Cave 159.]]
Dunhuang was established as a frontier garrison outpost by the Han Dynasty [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wudi]] to protect against the [[Xiongnu]] in 111 BC. It also became an important gateway to the West, a centre of commerce along the [[Silk Road]], as well as a meeting place of various people and religions such as [[Buddhism]].

The construction of the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang is generally taken to have begun sometime in the fourth century AD. According to a book written during the reign of Tang [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], ''Fokan Ji'' ({{lang|zh-hant|佛龕記}}, ''An Account of Buddhist Shrines'') by Li Junxiu ({{lang|zh|李君修}}), a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk named Lè Zūn ({{lang|zh-hant|樂尊}}, which may also be pronounced Yuezun) had a vision of a thousand [[Gautama Buddha|Buddhas]] bathed in golden light at the site in 366 AD, inspiring him to build a cave here.&lt;ref&gt;''Fokan Ji'' {{lang|zh-hant|《佛龕記》}} '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|莫高窟者厥，秦建元二年，有沙门乐僔，戒行清忠，执心恬静。当杖锡林野，行至此山，忽见金光，状有千佛。□□□□□，造窟一龛。}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story is also found in other sources, such as in inscriptions on a [[stele]] in cave 332; an earlier date of 353 however was given in another document, ''Shazhou Tujing'' ({{lang|zh-hant|沙州土鏡}}, ''Geography of Shazhou'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Le Huu Phuoc |title=Buddhist Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Grafikol |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9844043-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined by a second monk Faliang ({{lang|zh|法良}}), and the site gradually grew, by the time of the [[Northern Liang]] a small community of monks had formed at the site. The caves initially served only as a place of meditation for hermit monks, but developed to serve the monasteries that sprang up nearby. Members of the ruling family of [[Northern Wei]] and [[Northern Zhou]] constructed many caves here, and it flourished in the short-lived [[Sui Dynasty]]. By the [[Tang Dynasty]], the number of caves had reached over a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Sui and Tang dynasties, Mogao Caves had become a place of worship and pilgrimage for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dunhuang Sees Great Changes Over the Years |author=Xiuqing Yang |publisher=China Intercontinental Press |year=2007 |isbn=7-5085-0916-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 4th until the 14th century, caves were constructed by monks to serve as shrines with funds from donors. These caves were elaborately painted, the cave paintings and architecture serving as aids to [[meditation]], as visual representations of the quest for enlightenment, as [[mnemonic]] devices, and as teaching tools to inform those illiterate about Buddhist beliefs and stories. The major caves were sponsored by patrons such as important clergy, local ruling elite, foreign dignitaries, as well as Chinese emperors. Other caves may have been funded by merchants, military officers, and other local people such as women's groups.

During the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang became the main hub of commerce of the Silk Road and a major religious centre. A large number of the caves were constructed at Mogao during this era, including the two large statues of Buddha at the site, the largest one constructed in 695 following an edict a year earlier by Tang Empress [[Wu Zetian]] to build giant statues across the country.&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=daqin&amp;f=false  |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site escaped the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|persecution of Buddhists]] ordered by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] in 845 as it was then under [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] control. As a frontier town, Dunhuang had been occupied at various times by other non-Han Chinese people. After the Tang Dynasty, the site went into a gradual decline, and construction of new caves ceased entirely after the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. By then Islam had conquered much of Central Asia, and the Silk Road declined in importance when trading via sea-routes began to dominate Chinese trade with the outside world. During the Ming Dynasty, the Silk Road was finally officially abandoned, and Dunhuang slowly became depopulated and largely forgotten by the outside world. Most of the Mogao caves were abandoned; the site, however, was still a place of pilgrimage and was used as a place of worship by local people at the beginning of the twentieth century when there was renewed interest in the site.

=== Discovery and revival ===
[[File:Anonymous-Bodhisattva Leading the Way.jpg|thumb|right|Bodhisattva leading a lady [[donor portrait|donor]] towards the Pure Lands. Painting on silk (Library Cave), Late Tang.]]
During late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Western explorers began to show interest in the ancient Silk Road and the lost cities of Central Asia, and those who passed through Dunhuang noted the murals, sculptures, and artifacts such as the [[Stele of Sulaiman]] at Mogao. The biggest discovery, however, came from a Chinese [[Taoist]] named [[Wang Yuanlu]] who appointed himself guardian of some of these temples around the turn of the century.

Some of the caves had by then been blocked by sand, and Wang set about clearing away the sand and made an attempt at repairing the site. In one such cave, on 25 June 1900, Wang discovered a walled up area behind one side of a corridor leading to a main cave.&lt;ref name="Duan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idp"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous [[Dunhuang manuscripts|hoard of manuscripts]]. In the next few years, Wang took some manuscripts to show to various officials who expressed varying level of interest, but in 1904 Wang re-sealed the cave following an order by the governor of Gansu.

[[File:Wang Yuanlu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Abbot [[Wang Yuanlu]], discoverer of the hidden Library Cave]]
Words of Wang's discovery drew the attention of a joint British/Indian group led by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist [[Aurel Stein]] who was on an archaeological expedition in the area in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-9/V-2/page/0283.html.en Aurel Stein, Serindia vol. II] pg. 801-802&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein negotiated with Wang to allow him to remove a significant number of manuscripts as well as the finest paintings and textiles for a fee. He was followed by a French expedition under [[Paul Pelliot]] who acquired many thousands of items in 1908, and then by a Japanese expedition under [[Otani Kozui]] in 1911 and a Russian expedition under [[Sergei F. Oldenburg]] in 1914. A well-known scholar [[Luo Zhenyu]] edited some of the manuscripts Pelliot acquired into a volume which was then published in 1909 as "Manuscripts of the Dunhuang Caves" ({{lang|zh-hant|敦煌石室遺書}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/dunhuang-shi-shi-yi-shu/oclc/52768538 Dunhuang shi shi yi shu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein and Pelliot provoked much interest in the West about the Dunhuang Caves; however, there was initially little interest in official circles in China. Concerned that the remaining manuscripts might be lost, Luo Zhenyu and others persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the rest of the manuscripts to be sent to Peking ([[Beijing]]) in 1910. However, not all the remaining manuscripts were taken to Peking, and of those retrieved, some were then stolen. Some of the caves were [[Russians in China#Vandalism of Mogao Caves|damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers]] when they were used by the local authority in 1921 to house Russian soldiers fleeing the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] following the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="杨秀清2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang |first1=Xiuqing (杨秀清) |script-title=zh:风雨敦煌话沧桑: 历经劫难的莫高窟 Feng yu Dunhuang hua cang sang: li jing jie nan de Mogao ku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtshc7KLLJwC&amp;pg=PT163|year=2006| publisher = [[:zh:五洲传播出版社|China Intercontinental Press]]|isbn=978-7-5085-0916-7|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, American explorer [[Langdon Warner]] removed a number of murals as well as a statue from some of the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foreign Devils on the Silk Road |author=Peter Hopkirk |authorlink = Peter Hopkirk|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DoxsQDBQHYEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7195-6448-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/209770 |title = From the Harvard Art Museums’ collections Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha (from Mogao Cave 323, Dunhuang, Gansu province) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://img.mp.itc.cn/upload/20160413/2e3f23e8bbaf4d3598091e5b13e369c0.jpg |title = Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 [[Kuomingtang]] soldiers stationed at Dunhuang caused some damage to the murals and statues at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew|title= Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road |year=2000|publisher= The British Library |page=37|isbn= 0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation improved in 1941 when, following a visit by [[Wu Zuoren]] to the site the previous year, the painter [[Zhang Daqian]] arrived at the caves with a small team of assistants and stayed for two and a half years to repair and copy the murals. He exhibited and published the copies of the murals in 1943, which helped to publicize and give much prominence to the art of Dunhuang within China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp The Epochal Significance in Zhang Daqian's Copies of Dunhuang Fresco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728114420/http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Xiang Da then persuaded [[Yu Youren]], a prominent member of the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party), to set up an institution, the Research Institute of Dunhuang Art (which later became the [[Dunhuang Research Academy|Dunhuang Academy]]), at Mogao in 1944 to look after the site and its contents. In 1956, the first [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]], [[Zhou Enlai]], took a personal interest in the caves and sanctioned a grant to repair and protect the site; and in 1961, the Mogao Caves were declared to be a specially protected historical monument by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and large-scale renovation work at Mogao began soon afterwards. The site escaped the widespread damage caused to many religious sites during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;pg=233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=223 |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Library Cave ==

[[File:Dunhuang Cave 16.jpg|thumb|280px|Picture of Cave 16, by Aurel Stein in 1907, with manuscripts piled up beside the entrance to Cave 17, the Library Cave, which is to the right in this picture.]]
The cave no. 17 discovered by [[Wang Yuanlu]] came to be known as the Library Cave. It is sited off the entrance leading to cave no.16, and was originally used as a memorial cave for a local monk Hongbian on his death in 862. Hongbian, from a wealthy Wu family, was responsible for the construction of cave 16, and the Library Cave may have been used as his retreat in his lifetime. The cave originally contained his statue which was moved to another cave when it was used to keep manuscripts, some of which bear Hongbian's seal. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002 were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts, including a Hebrew penitential prayer (selichah) (see [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]). The Library Cave also contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia. According to Stein who was the first to describe the cave in its original state:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-8/V-2/page/0246.html.en Opening of the hidden chapel] M. Aurel Stein, ''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol II''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Heaped up in layers, but without any order, there appeared in the dim light of the priest's little lamp a solid mass of manuscript bundles rising to a height of nearly ten feet, and filling, as subsequent measurement showed, close on 500 cubic feet. The area left clear within the room was just sufficient for two people to stand in.|Aurel Stein|''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol. II''}}
The Library Cave was walled off sometime early in the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed as the reason for sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the [[Tripitaka]] became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Fujieda, "The Tun-Huan Manuscripts", in ''Essays on the sources for Chinese history'' (1973). edited by Donald D. Leslie, Colin Mackerras, and Wang Gungwu. [[Australian National University]], {{ISBN|0-87249-329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf The Provenance and Character of the Dunhuang Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223151/http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as Pelliot, suggested an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents in advance of an attack by invaders, perhaps when [[Western Xia|Xi Xia]] invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed in light of the absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist [[kingdom of Khotan]] to [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanids]] invaders from [[Kashgar]] in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Rong, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/asie_0766-1177_1999_num_11_1_1155 The Nature of the Dunhuang Library Cave and the Reasons for its Sealing]&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is generally accepted to be 1002, and although other dates have been suggested, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.

===Dunhuang manuscripts===
{{Main|Dunhuang manuscripts}}
[[File:Pelliot cave163.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Paul Pelliot]] examining manuscripts in the Library Cave, 1908]]

The manuscripts from the Library Cave date from fifth century until early eleventh century when it was sealed. Up to 50,000 manuscripts may have been kept there, one of the greatest treasure troves of ancient documents found. While most of them are in Chinese, a large number of documents are in various other languages such as [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uigur]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], including the then little-known [[Saka language|Khotanese]]. They may be old hemp paper scrolls in Chinese and many other languages, Tibetan pothis, and paintings on hemp, silk or paper. The subject matter of the great majority of the scrolls is Buddhist in nature, but it also covers a diverse material. Along with the expected Buddhist canonical works are original commentaries, [[apocrypha]]l works, workbooks, books of prayers, [[Confucian]] works, [[Taoist]] works, [[Nestorian Christian]] works, works from the Chinese government, administrative documents, anthologies, glossaries, dictionaries, and calligraphic exercises.

Many of the manuscripts were previously unknown or thought lost, and the manuscripts provide a unique insight into the religious and secular matters of Northern China as well as other Central Asian kingdoms from the early periods up to the Tang and early Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitfield, Susan |title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith. |year=2004  |publisher=British Library, Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscripts found in the Library Cave include the earliest dated printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] from 868, which was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the fourth century. These scrolls also include manuscripts that ranged from the Nestorian [[Jesus Sutras]] to the [[Dunhuang Go Manual]] and ancient music scores, as well as the image of the [[Chinese astronomy]] [[Dunhuang map]]. These scrolls chronicle the development of Buddhism in China, record the political and cultural life of the time, and provide documentation of mundane secular matters that gives a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of these eras.

The manuscripts were dispersed all over the world in the aftermath of the discovery. Stein's acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and [[Lotus Sutra]]s. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained [[Sinology|sinologist]] literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better selection of documents than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men's groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of [[palimpsest]] whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the [[paper]]. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of [[International Dunhuang Project]].

The art of Dunhuang covers more than ten major genres, such as [[architecture]], [[stucco]] sculpture, [[Mural|wall paintings]], silk paintings, calligraphy, woodblock printing, embroidery, literature, music and dance, and popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew. "Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road" (2000). The British Library. {{ISBN|0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The caves are examples of [[rock-cut architecture]], but unlike [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], the local rock is a rather soft [[gravel]] conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' styles seen in places such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the [[stupa]] round which worshippers may [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] (''[[parikrama]]'') and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian [[vihara]] (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.

Many of the caves originally had wooden porches or fore-temples built out from the cliff, but most of these have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses the Great Buddha and was originally 4 storeys high, but it has been repaired at least 5 times and is no longer the original structure. A storey was added between 874-885, then repaired in the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murals===
[[File:Dunhuang General Zhang Yichao army detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of mural commemorating the victory of General [[Zhang Yichao]] over the [[Tibetan Empire]]. Cave 156, Late Tang Dynasty.]]
The murals in the caves date from a period of over a thousand years, from the 5th to the 14th century, and many earlier ones were repainted at later points within the period. The murals are extensive, covering an area of {{convert|490,000|ft2|m2|abbr=off}}. The most fully painted caves have paintings all over the walls and ceilings, with geometrical or plant decoration filling the spaces not taken by figurative images, which are above all of the [[Buddha]]. Sculpture is also brightly painted. The murals are valued for the scale and richness of content as well as their artistry. Buddhist subjects are most common, however some have traditional mythical subjects and [[donor portrait|portraits of patrons]]. These murals document the changing styles of Buddhist art in China for nearly a thousand years. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee during the Tang period, and the quality of the work dropped after the tenth century.

Early murals showed a strong Indian and Central Asian influence in the painting techniques used, the composition and style of the paintings as well as costumes worn by the figures, but a distinct Dunhuang style began to emerge during Northern Wei Dynasty.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite book |title=Three Thousands Years of Chinese Paintings |author=Yang Xin, Rihard M. Branhart, Nie Chongzheng, [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]], Lang Shaojun, Wu Hung. |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motifs of Chinese, Central Asian and Indian origin may be found in a single cave, and Chinese elements increased during the Western Wei period.&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

A common motif in many caves is the areas entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which this and other "Thousand Buddhas Caves" are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using [[stencil]]s so that identical figures may be replicated. Flying [[apsara]]s, or celestial beings may be depicted in the ceiling or above the Buddhas, and figures of donors may be shown along the bottom of the walls. The paintings often depict [[jataka tales]] which are stories of the life of Buddha, or [[avadana]] which are parables of the doctrine of [[karma]].

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao mural repainted.jpg|thumb|Early mural revealed after later over-painting had been partly removed. The flesh tones of the figure with its pigments protected from oxidation contrast with the darkened tone of buddhas in later painting seen on the right. Cave 253, Northern Wei.]]

[[Bodhisattvas]] started appearing during the Northern Zhou period, with [[Avalokitesvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), which was originally male but acquired female characteristics later, the most popular. Most caves show [[Mahayana]] and [[Sravakayana]] ([[Theravada]] or [[Hinayana]]) influences, although Mahayana Buddhism became the dominant form during the Sui Dynasty. An innovation of the Sui-Tang period is the visual representation of the sutra &amp;ndash; Mahayana Buddhist teachings transformed into large complete and detailed narrative paintings.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"/&gt;  One of the central features of Tang art in Mogao is the representation of the paradise of the [[Pure Land]], indicating the increasing popularity of this school of Mahayana Buddhism in the Tang era. The iconography of [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]], such as the eleven-headed or thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, also started to appear in Mogao wall paintings during the Tang period. It became popular during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang and the subsequent periods, especially during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"/&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang figures showing shading technique.jpg|thumb|left|Figures showing shading technique, and on the left, the effect of darkening of the paint used in shading which changed the appearance of the figure.]]
While Buddhist art is stylistically distinct from secular art, the style of paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as we know of this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General [[Zhang Yichao]], who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s ([[Uyghur Gansu Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Qocho]]) and the Saka [[Kingdom of Khotan]] and their portraits are featured prominently in some of the caves.&lt;ref name="dra"/&gt;

Many of the figures have darkened due to oxidation of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light. Many early figures in the murals in Dunhuang also used painting techniques originated from India where shading was applied to achieve a 3-dimensional or [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref name="dra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.dha.ac.cn/content.aspx?id=185436748917 |title=The Art of Dunhuang |work=Dunhuang Research Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the darkening of the paint used in shading over time resulted in heavy outlines which is not what the painters had originally intended. This shading technique is unique to Dunhuang in East Asia at this period as such shading on human faces was generally not done in Chinese paintings until much later when there were influences from European paintings. Another difference from traditional Chinese painting is the presence of figures that are semi-nude, occasionally fully nude, as figures are generally fully clothed in Chinese paintings. Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.

===Sculptures===
[[File:Great Buddha, Cave 96, Mogao Caves.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Buddha of cave 96]]

There are around 2,400 surviving clay sculptures at Mogao. These were first constructed on a wooden frame, padded with reed, then modelled in clay stucco, and finished with paint. The giant statues however have a stone core. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is generally shown as the central statue, often attended by [[boddhisattva]]s, [[Four Heavenly Kings|heavenly kings]], [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s, and apsaras, along with [[yaksha|yaksas]] and other mythical creatures.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Grotta nr 275.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in cave 275 from [[Northern Liang]] (397-439), one of the earliest caves. The crossed ankle figure with a three-disk crown shows influence from [[Kushan]] art.]]

The early figures are relatively simple and mainly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Buddhas of Northern Wei may have two attendant Bodhisattvas, and two further disciples were added in Northern Zhou, forming a group of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Figures from the Sui and Tang periods may be present as larger groups of seven or nine, and some showed large-scale [[parinirvana]] scene with groups of mourners. The early sculptures were based on Indian and Central Asian prototypes, with some in the [[Greco-Indian]] style of [[Gandhara]]. Over time the sculptures showed more Chinese elements and became gradually sinicized.

The two giant statues represent [[Maitreya Buddha]]. The earlier and larger one in cave 96, at 35.5 m high, was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and giant statues in 694. The smaller one is 27 m tall and was constructed in 713-41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger northern giant Buddha was damaged in an earthquake and had been repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing, colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its original Early Tang appearance. The southern statue however is largely in its original form apart for its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger Buddha is housed in a prominent wooden 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"/&gt;
[[File:BeijingNationalArtMuseumofChina7.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of the reclining Buddha of the Tibetan period from cave 158. [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing.]]

One type of caves constructed during the Tibetan era is the Nirvana Cave, which features a large reclining Buddha that covers the entire length of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of mourners in murals or in sculptural forms are also depicted along the length of the hall behind the Buddha. The Buddha figure in cave 158 measures 15.6 m long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |pages=170–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original function of the "Library Cave" was as a shrine commemorating Hong Bian, the 9th-century monk. His portrait statue, unusual here and among all surviving works in China, was removed to another spot when the cave was sealed up in the 11th century, but has been returned now the library has been removed. There is also a stone [[stele]] describing his life, and the wall behind the statue is painted with attendant figure; such blending of painted sculpture and wall paintings into a single composition is very common at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings on silk and paper===
Before the discovery in the Library Cave, original paintings on silk and paper from the Tang dynasty, a formative period in Chinese art, were very rare, and most of the surviving examples were copies made in later periods. Over a thousand paintings on silk, banners, and embroideries were found in the Library Cave, none apparently dating before the late 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of the paintings are anonymous, but many are of high quality, especially from the Tang. Most are sutra paintings, images of Buddha, and narrative paintings. The paintings show something of the contemporary Chinese style of the capital [[Chang'an]], but many also reflect Indian, Tibetan and Uighur painting styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |page=235 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are brush paintings in ink alone, some in just two colours, as well as many in full colour. Most common are single figures, and most paintings were probably donated by an individual, who is often portrayed on a diminutive scale. The donor figures become notably more elaborate in dress by the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 21, and numbers 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed images===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|280px|The Chinese ''Diamond Sūtra'', the oldest known dated [[Woodblock printing|printed]] book in the world, {{IDP|Or.8210/P.2|British Library}}.]]
The Library Cave is equally important as a source of rare early images and texts produced by [[woodblock printing]], including the famous [[Diamond Sutra]], the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also printed out at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 99-107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao textile embroidery.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of embroidered panel from the Library Cave. A small duck is shown in the middle among the flowers. Tang Dynasty.]]

===Textiles===
The textiles found in the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks' apparel ([[Kasaya (clothing)|kāṣāya]]). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth as a sign of humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Museum Book of Chinese Art |author=Jessica Rawson |publisher=British Museum Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7141-1453-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered.  [[Window valance|Valances]] used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caves==
[[File:Dunhuang mural flying apsarasa.jpg|thumb|Flying apsaras, or celestial beings. Caves 285, 538-539 AD, Western Wei Dynasty]]
The caves were cut into the side of a cliff which is close to two kilometers long. At its height, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], there were more than a thousands caves, but over time many of the caves were lost, including the earliest caves. 735 caves currently exist in Mogao; the best-known ones are the 487 caves located in the southern section of the cliff which are places of pilgrimage and worship.   248 caves have also been found to the north which were living quarters, meditation chambers, and burial sites for the monks. The caves at the southern section are decorated, while those at the northern section are mostly plain.

The caves are clustered together according to their era, with new caves from a new dynasty being constructed in different part of the cliff. From the murals, sculptures, and other objects found in the caves, the dates of around five hundred caves have been determined. Following is a list of the caves by era, compiled in the 1980s (more have been identified since):

* [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (366-439) - 7 caves, the oldest dated to [[Northern Liang]] period.
* [[Northern Wei]] (439-534) and [[Western Wei]] (535-556) - 10 from each phase
* [[Northern Zhou]] (557-580) - 15 caves
* [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618) - 70 caves
* Early Tang (618- 704) - 44 caves
* High Tang (705-780) - 80 caves
* Middle Tang (781-847) - 44 caves (This era in Dunhuang is also known as the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] period because Dunhuang was then under Tibetan occupation.)
* Late Tang (848-906) - 60 caves (This and the subsequent periods until the Western Xia period are also known collectively as the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period (歸義軍, Return to Righteousness Army, 848-1036) when Dunhuang was ruled by the Zhang and Cao families.)
* [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|The Five Dynasty]] (907-960) - 32 caves
* [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1035)- 43 caves
* [[Western Xia]] (1036–1226) - 82 caves
* [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1227–1368) - 10 caves

The '''music of Iraq''' or '''Iraqi music''', ({{lang-ar|موسيقى عراقية}}), also known as the '''Music of Mesopotamia''' encompasses the music of a number of ethnic groups and musical genres. Ethnically, it includes [[Arabic music]], [[Assyrian/Syriac folk music|Assyrian]],  [[Kurdish music|Kurdish]] and the music of [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], among others. Apart from the traditional music of these peoples, Iraqi music includes contemporary music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[urban contemporary]].

Iraq is recognized mainly for three instruments, the [[Oud]], [[Iraqi Santur]] and [[Rebab|Joza]]. The most renowned Oudists are [[Ahmed Mukhtar]], [[Naseer Shamma]], [[Rahim AlHaj]], [[Sahar Taha]] and [[Munir Bashir]].

==Classical Iraqi Music==
[[Image:ComedianpartyBaghdad.jpg|thumb|Musical theater group in [[Baghdad]], 1920s.]] 
Iraqi classical music necessitates some discussion of the social environment, as well as references to the poetry. Poetry is always rendered clearly. Poetry is the art of the Iraqis, and sung poetry is the finest of all. In [[Baghdad]] from 760-1260, writers spurned musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/caml/en/review/31-2/conference.htm Classical Music in Iraq] Virginia Danielson, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; The music is melodically modal, and moves in a stepwise motion with repeated notes. Use of the lower end of a melodic range is characteristic, as is the use of silence; one listens through the silence. Following a cadence, the singer moves up to the next range of pitches. An arch shape is discernible, and the work ends in the original mode.

Singers of the Baghdad Court were praised for their excellence in composition, their knowledge of history and songs, and their ornaments and innovations. There was support for female singers and orators, such as Arib, a skilled poet, calligrapher, lutenist, composer, and backgammon player who wrote more than one thousand songs. The common instrument (comparable in popularity to the piano or violin in the west) is the oud. Classical Iraqi music is identifiable by the genre/canon, and by how it is performed.

Historically, music would have been played for gatherings of men. With the advent of the sound recording industry, things have changed somewhat. Today one invites musicians to perform at weddings; by the first quarter of the century, concerts were being staged at concert venues.

===Maqam===
[[Image:Iraqi-fluteplayer.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional flute player from Iraqi folk troupe]]
Across the Arab world, ''[[Arabic maqam|maqam]]'' refers to specific [[mode (music)|melodic modes]]. When a musician performs maqam performances, the performer improvises, based on rules. There are a number of different maqams, each with its own mood and characteristics.  There are between fifty and seventy maqams, many of which have sub-styles.  Other characteristics of Iraqi music include a slow tempo, rhythmically free ornamentation or melodic lines, and predominantly minor modes.  Instruments include [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]], [[riq]], santur, [[goblet drum|darbuka]], [[naqareh]], [[ney]], djose and [[oud]].  Baghdad's ''Chalgi'' ensembles typically include the djoze and ney, and may also utilize an oud.
[[file:Ahmed_al-Musili,_Muwashah_02.ogg|right|thumb|"Lil 'Ashiqi fi-l Hawa Dala'il" by Ahmed Abdul Qadir al-Musili (1877-1941).]]
[[Maqama]] texts are often derived from classical [[Arabic poetry]], such as by [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri]], [[al-Mutanabbi]] and [[Abu Nuwas]], or Persian poets like [[Hafez]] and [[Omar Khayyám]].  Some performers used traditional sources translated into the dialect of Baghdad, and still others use Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Hebrew, Turkmen, Aramaic or Persian language lyrics.

====History====
The roots of modern Iraqi maqam can be traced as far back as the Abbassid Caliphate, when that large empire was controlled from Baghdad.

The [[pesteh]], a kind of light song which concludes a maqam performance, has been popularized in the later 20th century, growing more prominent along with the rise of recorded music and broadcast radio.  Among the most popular pesteh performers are the husband and wife [[Salima Pasha]] and [[Nazem Al-Ghazali]].

The most popular modern singers of maqam are [[Rachid Al-Qundarchi]] (1887–1945), [[Youssouf Omar]] (1918–1987), [[Nazem Al-Ghazali]] (1920–1963), [[Salim Shibbeth]] (born 1908), [[Hassan Chewke]] (1912–1962), [[Najim Al-Sheikhli]] (1893–1938), [[Mohammed Al-Qubanchi]] (1900–1989), [[Hamid Al Saadi]] (1959-)  and [[Farida Mohammad Ali]] (1963- ).

==Modern era==
[[File:MBashir.jpg|thumb|[[Munir Bashir]], an acclaimed oud singer.]]
[[File:Omar bashir.jpeg|thumb|[[Omar Bashir]], a modern day oud singer.]]

For much of the 20th century, Egypt was the center for Arab popular music, with only a few stars from other countries finding international success. Singers were [[Muslim]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Christian]]s.

[[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] instrumentalists attended the famous 1932 Arabic music congress in Cairo, which the Muslim vocalist Muhammed al-Qubanchi also attended. In 1936, Iraq Radio was established by two of Iraq's most prominent performers and composers, Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaity with an ensemble, with the exception of the percussion player.  The nightclubs of Baghdad also featured almost entirely Jewish musicians.  At these nightclubs, ensembles consisted of oud, qanun and two percussionists while the same format with ney and cello were used on the radio.&lt;ref name=Kojaman&gt;{{cite web|last=Kojaman|first=Yeheskel|title=Jewish Role in Iraqi Music|url=http://www.dangoor.com/72page42.html|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons for the predominance of Jewish instrumentalists in early 20th century Iraqi music was a prominent school for [[blindness|blind]] Jewish children, which was founded in the late 1920s by the great ''qanunji'' ("qanun player") Joseph Hawthorne (''Yusef Za'arur'') ({{lang-he|דנדהי ללוואלד-יוסף זערור}} {{lang-ar|يوسف زعرور}}). Many of the students became musicians, eventually forming the Arabic music ensemble "Israel Radio" ({{lang-he|קול ישראלי}} ''Qol Yisraeli'' ).

The most famous singer of the 1930s&amp;ndash;1940s was perhaps [[Salima Pasha]].&lt;ref name="Kojaman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasseh"&gt;{{Citation | last=Manasseh | first=Sara | publication-date=February 2004 | title=An Iraqi samai of Salim Al-Nur | periodical=Newsletter | publication-place=London | publisher=Arts and Humanities Research Board Research Centre for Cross-Cultural Music and Dance Performance | issue=3 | page=7 | url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/ahrbmusicanddance/newsletter/musicanddance3.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-09 | format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AManasseh+intitle%3AAn+Iraqi+samai+of+Salim+Al-Nur&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051202084829/http://www.soas.ac.uk/ahrbmusicanddance/newsletter/musicanddance3.pdf |archivedate = December 2, 2005}} .&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, two brothers began to gain prominence in the field of music in Iraq; the Kuwaiti brothers - Salih, a violin player, and Dawud, an oud player. Almost at the same time, the name of a woman singer, Salima Pasha began to achieve fame. The brothers, Salih and Dawud el-Kuwaiti began to perform and to compose new songs for Pasha. Salih became the most prominent musician in Iraq, and Pasha became the most famous singer.

Following the opening of the Iraqi Broadcast Station in 1936. Salih was asked to form the official music ensemble for the radio station. It was due to him, that two instruments, the cello and nay (flute), were introduced for the first time into the instrumental music ensemble. The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time, since public performance by women was considered shameful and most female singers were recruited from brothels.&lt;ref name="Kojaman"/&gt;

Numerous instrumentalists and singers of the middle and late twentieth century were trained at the [[Baghdad Conservatory]].

In recent years the Iraqi school of oud players has become very prominent, with players such as [[Salman Shukur]] and Munir Bashir developing a very refined and delicate style of playing combining older Arabic elements with more recent [[Anatolia]]n influences.

==Pop music==
Pop music in Iraq more often than not means musical motifs and lyrics dating back centuries but performed with a mix of traditional and modern instruments. [[Kadim Al Sahir]], for example, may be nicknamed "the Elvis of the Middle East," but he sings in classical Arabic. Popular musician [[Ilham al-Madfai]] features the electric guitar and saxophone, but uses the instruments to reinterpret age-old folk songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906050302/http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]], the most popular [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] was the '''Voice of Youth''', which used to play the popular music of Iraq to continue the culture of the country. The station also played a mix of rock, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and pop music from artists as far-ranging as [[Eminem]] to [[R.E.M.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906050302/http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which had to be imported via [[Jordan]] due to international [[economic sanctions]], and both disc jockeys and callers spoke exclusively in [[English language|English]]. [[Irish people|Irish]] bands  [[The Corrs]] and [[Westlife]] were especially popular. Iraq also produced a major pan-Arab pop star in exile in [[Kadim Al Sahir]], whose songs include ''Ladghat-e Hayya'', which was banned by Hussein for its racy lyrical content.

Other modern Iraqi singers include [[:ar:علي العيساوي (مغني)|Ali Al Essawi]], whose song ''Makhtuba'' became huge hit in the Arab world and made him famous throughout the region. Major artists include [[Shatha Hassoun]], Rahma Mezher, [[Majid al-Muhandis]], [[Hussam Al-Rassam]], [[Rida Al Abdullah]] and Iraq's very own boy band [[Unknown to No One]], as well as [[Acrassicauda]], Iraq's first [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. There are also ethnic  [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] singers such as [[Klodia Hanna]], [[Ashur Bet Sargis]] and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]  as well as a number of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Yazidi]], [[Dom people|Dom]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] musicians such as [[Seta Hagopian]].

==Effect of 2003 Iraq War==
Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and fall of Saddam Hussein, some militant extremists have been attacking musicians, especially those in the port city of [[Basra]], where the Wahabis are believed to be responsible.Basra's [[sea shanties]] are well known throughout Iraq.  Music shops in the [[Summar]] district have been the target of grenade bombings.  Extremist religious leaders have closed some of the concert halls and clubs in the city.

'''Nadhim Ramzi''' ({{lang-ar|ناظم رمزي}}; 14 July 1928 – 18 September 2013 from a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] family) was an Iraqi [[graphic designer]], [[calligrapher]], photographer, and painter best known for documenting life in Iraq from the 1950s by photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Photographer Bio |first= |title=Iraq, the land and the people|url=https://books.google.iq/books?id=KMqePQAACAAJ&amp;dq=iraq+the+land+and+the+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi54KD6gJ3SAhVGb5oKHSYKCroQ6AEIGjAA |agency=(1977) Iraqi Cultural Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career ==
Nadhim Ramzi was born in Baghdad into a family of Kurdish background. In his youth, Ramzi began to recognize the beauty of his natural environment and the local people in various parts of Iraq due to his father's constant movement. His father was administrative staff member during 1934–1944; Ramzi liked birds hunting and learned to draw them. He also loved the wilderness and the native people. Ramzi started to get involved and participate in a lot of hobbies that affected his future.&lt;ref name="Hamid"/&gt;

In Al-[[Yusufiyah]] he started practicing [[Islamic geometric patterns]] and became obsessed with it, and in [[Khan Bani Saad]] he found happiness in the life of the countryside and grazing sheep: "It was to this small village a great impact on my lifestyle and behavior. He watched artisans making carpets and ceramics, which aroused his interest in traditional design. He taught himself to paint at a very young age. &lt;ref name="moo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamid"/&gt;

And in [[Al-Mahawil District]] he got in touch with the ancient hills and ruins of the [[Babylonia]]n civilization, amazed and inspired by [[Art of Mesopotamia]] that has survived for decades.&lt;ref name="Hamid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mai Muzaffar (25 September 2013)|first=|title=The Iraqi artist N.Ramzi:In love with the land and people|url=http://www.alquds.co.uk/?p=87224|date=|language=Arabic |agency=Al-Quds Al-Arabi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramzi started photography as a hobby at the age of 16, when he received his first camera as a gift. "&lt;ref name="moo"&gt;{{cite news|last=  |first=|title=From the memory|url=|date=|agency=a book by N.Ramzi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Ramzi's good friend, Rifat Chidirji, described the photographer's approach:

{{block quote| Nadhim Ramzi was a very good friend of mine, and I knew of Latif Al-Ani's work through publications and exhibitions. They photographed with an attention to aesthetics, looking for beautiful compositions. I photographed things as they are. One day, I went out to take photographs with Nadhim Ramzi. We saw a bench. I immediately took several photographs, focusing on its structure. Ramzi went around it for about five minutes, and he ended up taking one image only. That was the difference between us. I documented quickly and moved on.&lt;ref&gt;Alsaden, A., "Capturing Evanescence: Rifat Chadirji and Balkis Sharara in conversation with Amin Alsaden," ''Ibraaz,'' 16 November 2016 [https://www.ibraaz.org/interviews/206 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ramzi's Printing Company===
Ramzi's traveled to Paris in 1964 where he stayed for two years and was introduced to printing methods and its techniques, He founded a printing company in [[Baghdad]] and named it after his name,&lt;ref name="Hamid"/&gt; It was one of the best printing companies in Iraq, it was located near Al Rasheed Camp's main road. The company was established in 70s and founded by Ramzi himself. It offered a variety of printing products and services with a focus on quality, and service.&lt;ref name="nkad"/&gt;

It contained three main departments:&lt;ref name="nkad"&gt;{{cite news|last=  |first=|title=The departure of the Iraqi art|url=http://www.alnaked-aliraqi.net/article/18404.php|date=|language=Arabic |agency=Al Mada Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guggenheim Museum and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, NY; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], CA; [[Tate Modern]], London, UK; [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris, France; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands among others. Fast Lives and works in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jamescohan.com/artists/omer-fast&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast is one of several contemporary artists who restages existing films, including [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Robert Melee]] and [[Yasumasa Morimura]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (March 8, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/08/arts/art-in-review-brice-delsperger.html ART IN REVIEW; Brice Delsperger] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''August'' (2017)===
In 2017, Fast was met with protests and allegations of [[racism]] by the Chinatown Art Brigade and others, including the [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] artist and 47 Canal gallery owner Margaret Lee,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.affidavit.art/articles/chinatown&lt;/ref&gt; for his August exhibition in the James Cohan gallery on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]]. The show was titled “August” after its centerpiece, a fine 3D video from 2016 that was inspired by the life of [[August Sander]], a German portrait and documentary photographer. But that video, along with an earlier one, has been upstaged by a surrounding installation that transforms Cohan’s white-box space into a New York Chinatown shop or bus-company waiting room with metal chairs, broken A.T.M.s and a shabby facade. Fast seems to have intended the Cohan gallery “waiting room” not as a replication of any real Chinatown but as the kind of fantasy version of immigrant neighborhoods evoked to justify “slum clearance.” While the work was intended to provoke a strong reaction&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer-fast-art-poverty-porn&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of Chinatown-based activists have called out&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/artists-chinatown-depiction-ignites-protests.html&lt;/ref&gt; the piece as racist “poverty porn,” pure and simple, and demanded its removal.

=== ''Remainder'' (2015)===
In 2015 Fast released his first [[feature film]],{{where|date=December 2017}} based on the [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] novel ''[[Remainder (novel)|Remainder]]''
.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://variety.com/2014/film/news/cannes-first-image-from-omer-fasts-remainder-starring-tom-sturridge-1201176279/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Continuity'' (2012) ===
''Continuity'' features an older couple who hires male escorts to play out their dead son’s return from Afghanistan. The 40-minute work explores loss and grief as much as the narrative constructions of fiction and the cinematic conventions used in documentary films.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Rojas (August 14, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cardiff-prize-show-isnt-afraid-to-talk-politics/33386 Cardiff prize show isn’t afraid to talk politics] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''5000 Feet is the Best'' (2011)===
Fast is the director of this [[short film]] shown on the [[Biennale di Venezia]] in 2011.

=== ''Nostalgia'' (2009)===
In October 2009, Fast’s exhibition "Nostalgia" opened at [[South London Gallery]]. The exhibition included ''Nostalgia'', a three-part film installation that intermingles a man’s account of his struggle for asylum in Britain with a reenactment of his story as a 1970s [[science fiction movie]] in which he attempts to flee a dystopian Europe and relocate to a colony in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Carnelia. "[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32955/omer-fast/ Omer Fast]." ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fast's 2009-2010 Nostalgia at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] was part of the 2008 [[Bucksbaum Award]], given to the most prominent artist in that year's [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAdams|first=Shane|title=Omer Fast|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=February 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/02/artseen/omer-fast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Casting'' (2007) ===
In the four-channel video piece ''Casting'',&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/arts/design/08fast.html Is It Reality or Fantasy? The Boundaries Are Blurred] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the viewer walks into the screening room initially encountering two hanging projection screens.  Each screen contains a different depiction of a narrative showing the characters acting while silent and remaining completely still.  The projection screens are double sided and contain two additional images on the rear side where the viewer sees two men engaged in an interview.  The two men are a young American Army sergeant and the artist in a dialog about the narrative.  The artist states during the interview that he is interested only in memory and how memory gets mediated; he says the work he is trying to achieve has or should have no political slant.  Although the work is politically ambiguous it shows the powerlessness of an American Army sergeant in the current Iraqi conflict and possibly the powerlessness of perceived American hegemonic power.

=== ''CNN Concatenated'' (2002)===
In 2002, Fast released ''CNN Concatenated'', an 18-minute-long single-channel video which uses CNN news anchor clips. The video is cut so that each word is spoken by a different newsperson. The pieces literally asks the viewers questions about media authenticity and gives CNN a distinct voice.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Wong: [http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/wong/wong7-22-02.asp Televisions], July 22nd, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Spielberg's List'' ===
The 59-minute two-channel work centers on interviews with residents of [[Krakow]], Poland, who worked as extras in the concentration camp scenes in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (April 18, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/arts/art-in-review-omer-fast.html ART IN REVIEW; Omer Fast] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The video suggests that, whatever their experience, many of them conflated the Hollywood version of the Holocaust with historical reality.&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/arts/design/08fast.html Is It Reality or Fantasy?

[[Image:Sarcophagus Portonaccio Massimo.jpg|thumb|280px|The Portonaccio sarcophagus]]
The '''Portonaccio sarcophagus''' is a 2nd-century [[ancient Roman]] [[sarcophagus]] found in the [[Portonaccio (Roma)|Portonaccio]] quarter of [[Rome]] and now held at the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]] ([[palazzo Massimo]]). Dating to between 190 and 200, it was used for the burial of a Roman general involved in the campaigns of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and shows influences similar to those of the [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]].
==Description==
The sarcophagus is one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group, and shows both considerable similarities to the [[Great Ludovisi sarcophagus]], the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Donald, et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 205, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300052936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Martin (ed), ''A Handbook of Roman Art'', p. 93, Phaidon, 1983, {{ISBN|0714822140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pairs of figures of an older man and a woman stand beneath trophies at either end of the main face, uninvolved in the battle.  These are at the same scale as the general, and all other the battling figures are smaller; indeed, in defiance of any attempt at perspective, the soldiers and horses at the "front" of the scene in the lower part are somewhat smaller than their equivalents at the "back" in the upper part.

[[File:Universidad de Alcala.jpg|thumb|300px|Facade of the [[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]], [[University of Alcalá|University of Alcalá de Henares]], by [[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]] (1537–1553).]]
'''Purism''' is an initial phase of [[Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance architecture in Spain]], which took place between 1530 and 1560, after to [[Isabelline Gothic]] and prior to the [[Herrerian]] architecture in the last third of the 16th century. The name "Prince Philip" refers to the period in which [[Philip II of Spain]] (born in 1527) had not yet received the inheritance of the [[Spanish Monarchy]] by abdication of his father the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] (1556). The name "Serlian" is due to the influential architect and treatise [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (in addition to the architectural element called ''Serlian'' in his honor). The [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], the purist and the [[Castizo|casticist]] are related to the interpretation given to different elements of style, whether intellectual, formal, structural or decorative. Until then, writers of the period termed the [[Classicism|classicist]] forms of the [[Italian Renaissance]] as the ''roman'' (Diego de Sagredo ''Las Medidas del Romano'', 1526), while the late-Gothic forms were called ''the modern''.&lt;ref&gt;Maroto, J. ''Historia del Arte'', Casals, {{ISBN|978-84-218-4021-4}}, pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt; For a more stylistic periodization more common in the [[art history]], at that point of the 16th century the ''[[Cinquecento]]'' had entered in its [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] phase, while for the Spanish art is commonly used the expression High Renaissance (reserving the term Low Renaissance for the last third of the century).

== Description ==
The introduction of the [[Renaissance]] in Spain coincided with a period of great splendor political, economic and social, after the union between [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], the end of the [[Reconquista]], the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of America]] and the coming to power of the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburgs]]. Although in its beginning the new style from [[Italy]] lived with the persistence of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Mudéjar]] forms, gradually took hold and served as the expression of the new political power, linked to the new conception of the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]]. In the first third of the 16th century came the [[Plateresque]], fine and elegant style of decoration, characterized by the use of [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] on the exterior walls, [[baluster]]ed [[column]]s with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], [[arch]]es or basket-handle, and [[pilaster]]s decorated with grotesques.

In front of the excessive decorate of [[Plateresque]] style, the Purism sought ways simpler and refined, in a sober and classic line, balance and technical perfection, taking more on structural issues and harmonious proportions. The architects have better preparation and training, with the publication of several theoretical treatises as ''Las Medidas del Romano'', [[Diego de Sagredo]] ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], 1526), first Renaissance Treaty writing outside Italy, which highlights the prevalence of proportion and the proper disposal of the elements over the decoration.

The purism was characterized by the use of oval or [[barrel vaults]], [[arch]]es, half domes and carved decoration limited to some strategic areas, evaluating the smooth space as an exponent of this new more pure and harmonious aesthetic. In general, the aspect of Purist architecture is of balance and monumentality, compared to the apparent fragility and decorativism of plateresque.

== Works ==
The main signs of the style are found in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Andalusia]].

In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] developed his work [[Alonso de Covarrubias]], launched in the [[plateresque]] (Courtyard of the [[Hospital de la Santa Cruz, Toledo|Hospital de la Santa Cruz]]), which reached the position of ''arquitecto real'' (1537). Among his buildings are the [[Puerta de Bisagra]] (in the form of a [[triumphal arch]]), the [[Alcázar of Toledo|Alcázar]] (rectangular and severe facade flanked by towers) and the [[Hospital de Tavera]] (1541), which for its classicism and sobriety aimed for Herrerian style. In [[Alcalá de Henares]] built the Palacio Arzobispal, a monumental facade topped by a gallery of arches.

[[File:Leon-diputacion.jpg|thumb|left|Palacio de los Guzmanes.]]
[[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]] worked mainly in [[Salamanca]], but was involved in projects throughout Castile. Also formed in the plateresque, although his most representative works are of purism. In 1539, projected –with Fray Martín de Santiago–, the [[Palace of Monterrey]], built only in one quarter, but that is a remarkable example of civil architecture, with magnificent towers with [[crenellation]]s and lookouts drafts. One of his best works would be the façade of [[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]] in the University of Alcalá de Henares (1537–1553), decorated with evenly distributed at regular intervals, [[pediment]] and top of [[crenellation]]s with garlands. Other works were the [[Palacio de los Guzmanes]] in [[León, León|León]], the [[Church of Santa María Magdalena (Valladolid)|church of Santa María Magdalena]] in [[Valladolid]] and the façades of the cathedralics dependences of [[Façade das Platerías|das Platerías]] in the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] (1540).

[[File:Cathedral de granda plan.jpg|thumb|Ground plan of the Cathedral of Granada.]]
[[Diego Siloe|Diego de Siloé]] also was initially one of the leading exponents of plateresque (Courtyard of the [[Colegio Mayor de Santiago el Zebedeo]], [[Salamanca]]; Golden Staircase of the [[Cathedral of Burgos]]). Subsequently, spent most of his work in [[Granada]], where he made the [[Pantheon (structure)|pantheon]] for [[El Gran Capitán]] in the [[Monastery of Saint Jerome (Granada)|Monastery of San Jerónimo]], in collaboration with the Italian [[Jacopo Torni]]. His main work was the [[Cathedral of Granada]] (begun in 1528), continuing the original Gothic design by [[Enrique Egas]], who made numerous changes, became the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] in a round dome shaped, preceded by a large triumphal arch type. In the [[Column|pillars]] of the [[nave]]s increased height with small columns on an entablature located in the capital, as had [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] in [[Florence]]. This provision influenced later works such as the cathedrals of [[Málaga Cathedral|Málaga]] and [[Guadix Cathedral|Guadix]], as well as [[Guadalajara Cathedral|Guadalajara (Mexico)]], [[Cathedral of Lima|Lima]] and [[Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco|Cuzco (Peru)]].

[[File:Ubeda.jpg|thumb|left|Sacra Capilla del Salvador in Úbeda.]]
in Granada also worked [[Pedro Machuca]], author of the [[Palace of Charles V]] at the [[Alhambra]] (started in 1528 and interrupted to death of the architect in 1550). The palace included a circular courtyard and an [[octagonal]] chapel, which was never built. The courtyard, of [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] influence, is one of the masterpieces of the Purism and the Spanish Renaissance architecture, example of balance and perfection of classical, with two-story with columns of [[Doric order|Doric]]-[[Tuscan order]] (lower) and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] (upper).

[[File:AlcarazTwinTowers.jpg|thumb|Torres de Alcaraz.]]
Another great example of Andalusian purism was [[Andrés de Vandelvira]], of own style that was directed then to [[Mannerism]]. One of his characteristic was the use of [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s, and in the Sacra Capilla del Salvador in [[Úbeda]] (1536) -project initiated by Siloé, with who Vandelvira worked in its beginning-. His great work was the [[Jaén Cathedral|Cathedral of Jaén]] (begun in 1540), rectangular, with pillars inspired by the [[Cathedral of Granada]]. Remarkably in this work the Sacristy, with double entablature and overlap of arches of Mannerist style, although of great structural simplicity. Other works were: the Chapel of San Francisco (1546), the Torre del Tardón in [[Alcaraz]] (1555), the palaces of Vela-Cobos (1561) and [[Vázquez de Molina Palace|Vázquez de Molina]] (1562) and the [[Hospital de Santiago]] (1562–1575), all in [[Úbeda]]. The work of Vandelvira left a strong mark on subsequent architecture, especially in Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante.

In Seville highlights the construction of the Royal Chapel of the [[Cathedral of Seville|cathedral]] and the [[Hospital de las Cinco Llagas]], by [[Martín de Gainza (arquitecto)|Martín de Gaínza]], and the top of the Giralda, by [[Hernán Ruiz the Younger]], of [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlian]] influence, that influence the later Andalusian altars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13223">'''"Rabbit rabbit rabbit"''' is a [[superstition]] found in Britain and North America wherein a person says or repeats the words "[[rabbit]]", "rabbits" and/or "white rabbits" aloud upon waking on the first day of a month, to ensure good luck for the rest of it.

==Origins and history==
The exact origin of the superstition is unknown, though it was recorded in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' as being said by children in 1909:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My two daughters are in the habit of saying 'Rabbits!' on the first day of each month. The word must be spoken aloud, and be the first word said in the month. It brings luck for that month. Other children, I find, use the same formula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In response to this note another contributor said that his daughter believed that the outcome would be a present, and that the word must be spoken up the chimney to be most effective; another pointed out that the word ''rabbit'' was often used in expletives, and suggested that the superstition may be a survival of the ancient belief in swearing as a means of avoiding evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It appeared in a work of fiction in 1922:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why," the man in the brown hat laughed at him, "I thought everybody knew 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.'  If you say 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit'—three times, just like that—first thing in the morning on the first of the month, even before you say your prayers, you'll get a present before the end of the month."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lynd, &lt;cite&gt;Solomon in All his Glory&lt;/cite&gt; (London, 1922), p. 49. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015048888161]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 1 of the [[Trixie Belden]] story ''The Mystery of the Emeralds'' (1962) is titled “Rabbit! Rabbit!” and discusses the tradition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Trixie Belden awoke slowly, with the sound of a summer rain beating against her window. She half-opened her eyes, stretched her arms above her head, and then, catching sight of a large sign tied to the foot of her bed, yelled out, “Rabbit! Rabbit!” She bounced out of bed and ran out of her room and down the hall. “I’ve finally done it!” she cried [...] “Well, ever since I was Bobby’s age I’ve been trying to remember to say ‘Rabbit! Rabbit!’ and make a wish just before going to sleep on the last night of the month. If you say it again in the morning, before you’ve said another word, your wish comes true.” Trixie laughed."&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kenny, &lt;cite&gt;The Mystery of the Emeralds&lt;/cite&gt; (1962), p. 1.

In the United States the tradition appears especially well known in northern [[New England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/marysfarm/rabbit#_ |title=Saying Rabbit, Rabbit - The Luck of the English |author=Edie Clark |date= |work=Yankee |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wdea.am/the-first-of-the-month-brings-the-luck-of-the-rabbit/ |title=The First of the Month Brings the Luck of the Rabbit |author=Chris Popper |date=September 30, 2012 |publisher=WDEA Ellsworth, Maine |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goodmorninggloucester.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/did-you-know-rabbit-rabbit/ |title=Did You Know? (Rabbit, Rabbit) |author= |date=December 1, 2011 |work=[[Good Morning Gloucester]] |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, like all folklore, determining its exact area of distribution is difficult. The superstition may be related to the broader belief in the rabbit or hare being a "lucky" animal, as exhibited in the practice of carrying a [[rabbit's foot]] for luck.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Panati | first1 = Charles | title = Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1989 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hI9Weq6q9dEC&amp;dq | accessdate = 2013-04-02 | isbn = 978-0060964191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1990s, [[United States|U.S.]] children's [[Cable television|cable]] channel [[Nickelodeon]] helped popularize the superstition in the United States as part of its "Nick Days," where during commercial breaks it would show an ad about the significance of the current date, whether it be an actual holiday, a largely uncelebrated unofficial holiday, or a made-up day if nothing else is going on that specific day. (The latter would be identified as a "Nickelodeon holiday.") Nickelodeon would promote the last day of each month as "Rabbit Rabbit Day" and to remind kids to say it the next day, unless the last day of that specific month was an actual holiday, such as [[Halloween]] or [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=Penny |url=http://www.thecheekybunny.com/2010/12/rabbit-rabbit-day.html |title=Rabbit Rabbit Day!! |publisher=The Cheeky Bunny |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116191100/http://www.thecheekybunny.com/2010/12/rabbit-rabbit-day.html |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice stopped by the late 1990s.

Rabbits have not always been thought of as lucky, however. In the 19th century, for example, fishermen would not say the word while at sea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==In other traditions==

There is another folk tradition which may use a variation "Rabbit", "Bunny", "I hate/love Grey Rabbits" or "White Rabbit" to ward off smoke that the wind is directing into your face when gathered around a campfire.&lt;ref&gt;http://folklore.usc.edu/?p=27779&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that this tradition may be related to the tradition of invoking the rabbit on the first of the month. Others conjecture that it may originate with a North American First Nation story about smoke resembling rabbit fur.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-I-hate-white-rabbits-campfire-tradition-come-from&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition may be more of a social tradition in a group setting than a genuine belief that certain words will change the wind direction, and may be more of a childhood tradition than an adult one. Children have sometimes adapted from Rabbit to "Pink Elephant" or other comical derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d6eki/what_did_you_do_as_a_kid_when_campfire_smoke_blew/&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this more mutable usage, historical record of this is even more scarce than other more static meanings.

As with all folklore, its truth is made evident even in its only occasional fulfillment: should the wind then appear to change direction, others will interpret the use of such an expression as evidence of its effectiveness and will then tend to adopt and repeat its use.  That multiple instances of its ''in''effectiveness also exist is discounted in light of the "fact" that it appeared to work once.

==Variants==
&lt;!-- ############# Please only add variations for which you can cite a good reliable source! ############### --&gt;
As with most [[folklore]], which is traditionally spread by word of mouth, there are numerous variants of the superstition, in some cases specific to a certain time period or region.

'''Rotten Sound''' is a Finnish [[extreme metal]] band from [[Vaasa]], formed in 1993. The band comprises vocalist Keijo Niinimaa, guitarist Mika Aalto, bassist Kristian Toivainen and drummer Sami Latva. The band has released eight studio albums and "earned a reputation for being one of the most intense bands on the Scandinavian death metal/grindcore scene".&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p440820|pure_url=yes}}|title=Rotten Sound Biography|last=Henderson|first=Alex|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Formation, ''Under Pressure'' and ''Drain'' (1993–2000) ===
Rotten Sound was founded by guitarist Mika Aalto in Vaasa, Finland, in 1993. The group started recordings in 1994, releasing the single ''Sick Bastard'' through Genet label. Their subsequent underground releases, between singles and EPs, included 1995's ''Psychotic Veterinarian'' on SOA, 1996's ''Loosin' Face'' on Anomie, and 1997's ''Splitted Alive'' on IDS.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;

Rotten Sound's first full-length album, ''Under Pressure'', was released by Repulse Records (a Spanish label) in 1998 and was followed by ''Drain'' (also on Repulse) in 1999. This album was also the debut of second guitarist Juha Ylikoski. In early 2000, the band signed with American [[Necropolis Records]], a subsidiary Deathvomit label for release the EP ''Still Psycho'', which included a cover of [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]'s "[[Symphonies of Sickness|Reek of Putrefaction]]".&lt;ref name="psycho-rev"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r494191|pure_url=yes}}|title=Still Psycho &gt; Review|last=Kott|first=Paul|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Kott of [[Allmusic]] praised the album saying, "Rotten Sound does a good job, and although the audio production does leave something to be desired, the finished product is well worth listening to for any fan of earlier death metal and more recent grindcore. The video segments are very well-produced, with fantastic live audio recording, multiple camera angles, and good edits."&lt;ref name="psycho-rev" /&gt; The band toured in Europe to promote the album, along with label mates Hateplow, In Aeturnum and [[Malevolent Creation]].&lt;ref name="Rockdetector"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/finland/rotten+sound#bio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325234054/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/finland/rotten+sound#bio|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-03-25|title=MusicMight – Artists – Rotten Sound &gt; Biography|publisher=rockdetector.com|accessdate=2008-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Murderworks'' and ''Exit'' (2001–2005) ===
Rotten Sound release their second full-length, ''[[Murderworks]]'', in 2002. The Allmusic reviewer Alex Henderson stated, "This 2002 release gives the listener no room to breathe; from start to finish, Murderworks is an exercise in sensory assault for the sake of sensory assault."&lt;ref name="murder-rev"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r570974|pure_url=yes}}|title=Murderworks &gt; Review|last=Henderson|first=Alex|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the album's promotion, the group headline a European tour, titled ''Murdering Europe'', with support of two [[Czech Republic|Czech]] bands, Fleshless and Lykathea Aflame.&lt;ref name="Rockdetector" /&gt; They also toured Europe during June 2003, along with Hateplow and [[Debauchery (band)|Debauchery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=12270|title=Hate Plow, Rotten Sound, Debauchery to tour Europe|date=2003-05-26|publisher=blabbermouth.net|accessdate=2008-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325125151/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=12270|archivedate=2009-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2004, Rotten Sound teamed up with [[Circle of Dead Children]], [[Phobia (band)|Phobia]] and Strong Intention for US ''Grind the East Coast'' tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=21245|title=Phobia, Rotten Sound, Strong Intention to team up for Grind the East Coast tour|date=2004-04-09|publisher=blabbermouth.net|accessdate=2008-10-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325125156/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=21245|archivedate=2009-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Exit (Rotten Sound album)|Exit]]'', was recorded at Soundlab studio in [[Örebro]], [[Sweden]] with engineer [[Mieszko Talarczyk]] and mastered at the Cutting Room.

===''Consume to Contaminate'' and ''Cycles'' (2006-2007)===
In January 2006, the band has embarked to European Tour dubbed the "Grind Your Face Off Tour 2006" in support of reissued ''[[Murderworks]]'' released on January 6, 2006 The "Grind Your Face Off Tour" extends for four weeks across European along with Sayyadina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=17379 |title=Rotten Sound Embark On European Tour |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date=January 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They released their an eight-song mini-CD ''[[Consume to Contaminate]]'' on June 7, 2006 via [[Spinefarm Records]].

===''Napalm'' and ''Cursed'' (2009-2011)===
In November 2009, the band signed a new record deal with [[Relapse Records]] to release their follow-up studio album of ''Cycles''. Keijo Niinimaa commented:

{{quote|Relapse Records has been a strong label for grindcore since they started, which is one of the reasons that made us want to re-release our ''Murderworks'' album through them in 2005. We will fit to their roster like a fist to an ass. Being along the same line with other label-mates is very important for us because we want to tour all over this planet with bands we like ourselves. The upcoming ''Napalm'' EP and the next full-length album will start a new and (even) more aggressive era for Rotten Sound. Doing it together with Relapse Records will make this period more grind than any of our phases before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rotten-sound-signs-to-relapse-records/ |title=ROTTEN SOUND Signs To RELAPSE RECORDS |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rotten Sound released the ''Napalm'' EP on March 30, 2010 via Relapse Records. It features three new tracks in addition to three [[Napalm Death]] covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rotten-sound-new-ep-to-include-napalm-death-covers/ |title=ROTTEN SOUND: New EP To Include NAPALM DEATH Covers |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotten Sound also join with [[Aborted]] and [[The Red Chord]] for the "Machines of Grind" tour, a three-week co-headlining European tour. The tour kicked off in mid-April, and included stops at the Neurotic Death Fest and Revolution Fest Open Air. The three bands also co-headlined on several dates throughout the United Kingdom for "Terrorizer Tour-ture", a tour sponsored by Terrorizer Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=52297 |title=Rotten Sound Announces European Tour Dates with Aborted and The Red Chord |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sacagawea dollar''' (also known as the "'''golden dollar'''") is a United States [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar coin]] that has been minted every year since 2000, although not released for general circulation from 2002 to 2008 and again from 2012 onward due to its general unpopularity with the public and low business demand for the coin. These coins have a copper core clad by [[manganese brass]], giving them a distinctive golden color.  The coin features an [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] by [[Glenna Goodacre]].  From 2000 to 2008, the reverse featured an eagle design by [[Thomas D. Rogers]]. Since 2009, the reverse of the Sacagawea dollar has been changed yearly, with each design in the series depicting a different aspect of Native American cultures.

The coin was first suggested as a replacement for the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]], which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The [[Statue of Liberty]] was originally proposed as the design subject, but [[Sacagawea]], the [[Shoshone]] guide of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], was eventually chosen.

The new dollar coin was heavily marketed by the [[United States Mint|Mint]] in a series of print, radio, and television advertisements, as well as Mint partnerships with [[Walmart]] and [[Cheerios]].  However, the Sacagawea dollar did not prove popular with the public, and mintage dropped sharply in the second year of production.  Production of Sacagawea dollars continued, from 2007 to 2016 in parallel with the U.S. [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential dollar]]s. In 2012, mintage numbers were reduced by over 90%, in line with a similar reduction for the Presidential Dollars, due to large stockpiles of unused dollar coins.

The Mint planned to issue the Sacagawea design in 22-[[Carat (purity)|karat]] gold as well, but this idea was quickly abandoned after the Mint's authority to strike the coins was questioned, and the Mint has retained ownership of the few such coins produced.  Soon after initial production of the dollar, it was noticed that a few of the dollar coins were erroneously struck with the obverse of a [[50 State Quarters|state quarter]] and the normal reverse.

==Background==
Due to the limited circulation of the cumbersome  [[Eisenhower dollar]], it was decided in the 1970s that a smaller dollar coin might prove more useful to the public.&lt;ref name="sba"&gt;{{cite journal

Anthony dollar|smaller dollar coin]] to be minted, which would depict [[Susan B. Anthony]], a prominent American [[suffragette]].&lt;ref name= "sba" /&gt; These new dollars also proved unpopular, due in large part to their similarity in size and metallic composition to the [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter-dollar]].&lt;ref name= "sba"/&gt; Since there was little interest in the coin as a circulating medium, most were placed in [[United States Mint]] and [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] vaults throughout the country, and mintage ceased after 1981.&lt;ref name="redbook"&gt;{{Cite book

Despite their initial lack of popularity, by the late 1990s the Treasury's supply of Anthony dollars began to dwindle due to their widespread use in vending machines (including more than 9,000 stamp machines situated in post offices across the United States) and mass transit turnstiles.&lt;ref name="sbasac"&gt;{{cite journal

| pages        = 22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1997, several bills were introduced to Congress with the intent of resuming mintage of small-sized dollar coins to keep up with demand.&lt;ref name="sbasac"/&gt; On March 20 of that year, Arizona Republican [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jim Kolbe]] introduced legislation calling for more dollar coins to be minted. Four months later, on July 24, Republican Representative [[Michael Castle]] of Delaware, a member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, also introduced legislation, calling for the [[Statue of Liberty]] to be the subject of the design.&lt;ref name="sbasac"/&gt; On October 21, Minnesota Republican [[Rod Grams]] introduced a bill in the Senate, also calling for the mintage of a newly designed dollar coin. The final legislation authorizing the design and production of a new dollar coin was based on Grams' bill.&lt;ref name="sbasac"/&gt; Also on October 21, in a hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, Treasury Department officials gave their support for a new dollar coin, recommending that it be gold-colored with a distinctive edge, to make it easily distinguishable from the quarter-dollar. During this hearing, [[Philip N. Diehl]], then Director of the Mint, estimated that it would take thirty months to begin production of the new coin.&lt;ref name="sbasac"/&gt;

The United States Senate approved the necessary legislation on November 9, 1997, and the House of Representatives did the same on November 13.&lt;ref name="sbasac"/&gt; On December 1 President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[50 State Quarters|50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act]], which became Public Law 105-124.&lt;ref name="50states"&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ124.105.pdf Public Law 105-124—Dec. 1, 1997]. United States Mint. Retrieved January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Section four of the act, which is entitled "United States $1 Coin Act of 1997", provided for a new dollar coin to be struck, stating in part: "The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the coin readily discernible".&lt;ref name="50states"/&gt; The act also gave authority to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to resume production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar until production could begin on the new dollar coin.&lt;ref name="50states"/&gt; In total, more than 41&amp;nbsp;million Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck bearing the date 1999.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt;

==Design history==

===Subject selection===
[[File:Mike Castle official portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Delaware Representative Michael Castle, who preferred the more popular Statue of Liberty design to the Sacagawea for the dollar coin.]]

Though the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 required a change in composition and edge, it did not dictate what was to appear on the coin.&lt;ref name="50states"/&gt; To determine this, Treasury Secretary [[Robert Rubin]] appointed a nine-member Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee. Rubin, who had the authority to select the coin's design as Secretary of the Treasury,&lt;ref name="liberty"&gt;{{cite journal

United States Mint. Retrieved January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They met in Philadelphia in June 1998, listening to seventeen concepts submitted by members of the public, and reviewing many more suggestions received by telephone, mail and email.&lt;ref name="designselection"/&gt; On June 9, 1998, the committee recommended [[Sacagawea]], the [[Shoshone]] guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, for the design of the new coin.&lt;ref name="designselection"/&gt; Despite the committee's choice of Sacagawea, Castle advocated that the Statue of Liberty be depicted, as per his earlier legislation.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; In a letter to the House of Representatives, Castle explained his objection, stating that the "goal in creating a new dollar coin is to make it more distinctive with a popular design that would encourage its wider use by the public."&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; Between November 18 and 22, 1998, the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] conducted a poll on behalf of Castle.&lt;ref name="gaopoll"&gt;[http://ftp.resource.org/gpo.gov/gao/reports/gg99024.pdf New Dollar Coin: Public Prefers Statue of Liberty Over Sacagawea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123055517/http://ftp.resource.org/gpo.gov/gao/reports/gg99024.pdf |date=November 23, 2011 }}. [[United States General Accounting Office]]. Retrieved January 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the poll was to determine which design the public would find more desirable.&lt;ref name="gaopoll"/&gt; In total, 65 percent preferred the Statue of Liberty, 27 percent preferred Sacagawea, two percent believed that either was acceptable, three percent said neither was acceptable, and an additional three percent had no opinion.&lt;ref name="gaopoll"/&gt; Despite Castle's objection, Sacagawea was ultimately chosen as the subject of the coin.

===Initial design selection===
Invitations were sent to 23&amp;nbsp;artists with guidelines as to what their designs should depict. The [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] was to depict a representation of Sacagawea, and the reverse an eagle symbolizing peace and freedom.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; Another guideline requested artists "be sensitive to cultural authenticity, and try to avoid creating a representation of a classical European face in Native American headdress."&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; In November and December 1998, members of the Native American community, teachers, [[Numismatics|numismatist]]s, historians, members of Congress, various government officials and others were invited by the United States Mint to review the submitted proposed designs.&lt;ref name="designselection"/&gt; Six obverse and seven reverse designs were originally selected for further consideration.&lt;ref name="designselection"/&gt;

After the Mint conducted a series of polls and focus groups, three obverse and four reverse designs were selected as finalists.&lt;ref name="designselection"/&gt; The Mint received approximately 90,000&amp;nbsp;e-mails in reference to the design selection process.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; In response to the large amount of feedback generated, Diehl stated that the internet has "allowed us to conduct a public outreach program of unprecedented scope to measure opinions of the designs."&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; All seven of the selected designs were forwarded to the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]]; the Commission chose an obverse design depicting Sacagawea with her infant son, [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]], as designed by sculptor [[Glenna Goodacre]]. Goodacre chose [[Randy'L He-dow Teton]] to model for Sacagawea, of whom there are no known contemporary portraits, to help the artist capture the features of a young Native American woman.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; The depiction of infant [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]] was partially modeled after one-year-old Adam Scholz, with assistance from his father, Peter Scholz. The chosen reverse, designed by Mint sculptor-engraver [[Thomas D. Rogers]], depicted a soaring eagle.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt;

===Native American redesign===
On September 20, 2007, {{USPL|110|82}}, known as the Native American $1 Coin Act, was signed by president [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="nativeamericanact"&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/nativeamerican/Legislation.pdf Public Law 110-82 – September 20, 2007]. United States Mint. Retrieved January 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The act specified in part that the one dollar coin shall depict "images celebrating the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and the history of the United States."&lt;ref name="nativeamericanact"/&gt; The act also called for the removal of the date from the obverse and "&lt;small&gt;[[E PLURIBUS UNUM]]&lt;/small&gt;" from the reverse of the coin, opting instead to add them to the edge.&lt;ref name="nativeamericanact"/&gt;  At this time the [[Mint mark|mintmark]] was also moved to the edge.

The program requires that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year.&lt;ref name="nativeamericanact"/&gt; In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the [[United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]], the Native American Caucus and the [[National Congress of American Indians]], the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint.&lt;ref name="designevaluation"&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/nativeamerican/?action=evalProc Reverse Candidate Theme and Design Evaluation and Selection Process for the Native American $1 Coin Program] United States Mint. Retrieved January 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="designevaluation"/&gt; At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes.&lt;ref name="designevaluation"/&gt; The suggestions are then sent to the [[Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee]], where a theme is recommended.&lt;ref name="designevaluation"/&gt; After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme.&lt;ref name="designevaluation"/&gt; Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.&lt;ref name="designevaluation"/&gt;

The first coin in the Native American series, issued in 2009, was designed by Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E.

==Production and release==
After her obverse design was approved, Goodacre visited the [[Philadelphia Mint]] engraving department six times in order to finalize the designs.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of [[Brass|manganese brass]] (containing about 77% copper, 12% [[zinc]], 7% [[manganese]], and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core.&lt;ref name="redbook"/&gt; This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetically]] identical to its predecessor, the [[cupronickel|copper-nickel]] Susan B. Anthony dollar.&lt;ref name="numismatist"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders |first=Mitch |date=March 2006 |title=Modern Dollar Coins |journal=[[The Numismatist]] |pages=114–115 |url=http://money.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=6241&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314014858/http://money.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=6241&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm |archivedate=March 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins.&lt;ref name="minting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilkes|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2010|title=Experimental Washes, Special Strikings Challenge to Collect|journal=[[Coin World]]|pages=126–128, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies.&lt;ref name="minting"/&gt; Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them.&lt;ref name="minting"/&gt; Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.&lt;ref name="minting"/&gt;

For her work creating the obverse of the Sacagawea dollar, Goodacre received a $5,000 commission; she requested that it be paid in dollar coins.&lt;ref name="goodacre"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilkes|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2010|title=Goodacre Receives Special Sac Dollars|journal=Coin World|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000-P dollars paid to Goodacre were struck on specially [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] blanks to give them a finish unique to that striking.&lt;ref name="goodacre"/&gt; Diehl and other Mint dignitaries personally delivered the coins to Goodacre on April 5, 2000.&lt;ref name="goodacre"/&gt; A similar specially burnished finish was used on the 75,000 2000-D dollars included in the Millennium Coin &amp; Currency sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smalldollars.com/dollar/add001.html|title=The 2000-D Burnished Sacagawea Dollar|website=www.smalldollars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Soon after release of the new coins, it was discovered that they tarnished quickly once in circulation. In April 2001 the Mint began testing an experimental rinse that would inhibit the tarnishing; however, the rinse was used only in that year.&lt;ref name="minting"/&gt;

===Marketing===
The act authorizing the dollar coin also provided for the Secretary of the Treasury to "adopt a program to promote the use of such coins by commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities, and Federal, State, and local government agencies."&lt;ref name="50states"/&gt; The Mint's initial advertising campaign, consisting of an estimated 1,600 television, radio and print advertisements and partnerships with the national retail chain [[Wal-Mart]] and the [[General Mills]] company, cost approximately $41&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="advertising"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Erik|date=March 8, 2010|title=Circulation Promotion for Sacagawea $1 Takes Unusual Paths|journal=Coin World|pages=119, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television ads consisted of the head of George Washington superimposed upon a body, voiced by actor [[Michael Keaton]], discussing the merits of the new dollar coin.&lt;ref name="advertising"/&gt;

Beginning in January 2000, the Mint began sending dollar coins to Wal-Mart and [[Sam's Club]] stores across the United States in order to help promote and circulate the coins.&lt;ref name="walmart"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mirabella|first=Lorraine|date=February 8, 2000|title=Sacagawea Dollar a Hit at Wal-Mart|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-02-08/business/0002080092_1_coin-wal-mart-anthony-dollar|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, $100&amp;nbsp;million worth of the dollars were shipped to the stores as part of the promotion.&lt;ref name="walmart"/&gt; Some store owners criticized the Mint's partnership with Wal-Mart and Sam's Club as being unfair to smaller retailers.&lt;ref name="walmart"/&gt; In response, Diehl noted that "every retailer and commercial establishment has the right to carry the Golden Dollar. The Mint's agreement with Wal-Mart is designed to encourage all retailers and commercial businesses in the nation to use the new Golden Dollar in everyday transactions."&lt;ref name="walmart"/&gt;

During this time, the Mint began a partnership with the General Mills company, in which 10,000,000 boxes of [[Cheerios]] cereal would contain a 2000-dated [[Lincoln cent]] as a prize, one in every 2,000 boxes would contain a new Sacagawea dollar and one in every 4,400 would hold a certificate redeemable for 100 Sacagawea dollars.&lt;ref name="cheerios"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilkes|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2010|title=Cereal Promotion Offers Collectors Welcome $1 Surprise|journal=Coin World|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that the dollars included in every 2,000 boxes were in fact early strikes, differing from those ultimately issued for circulation by the number of tail feathers on the eagle.&lt;ref name="cheerios"/&gt; Approximately 5,500 of the coins were included in the boxes of cereal.&lt;ref name="cheerios"/&gt;  Far less of these dollars are known, since many may have been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/cheerios-dollar-profile-768545|title=Why Is This Sacajawea Dollar Worth Thousands of Dollars?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later analysis also showed that an unknown number of them had the normal "Reverse of 2000" rather than what collectors called the enhanced tail feathers "Reverse of 1999".  Thus the fact that a coin came from the cereal box does not guarantee that it is the rare variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgs.com/News/Cheerios-Sacagawea-Dollar-Found-Without-Enhanced-Tail-Feathers-Design|title="Cheerios" Sacagawea Dollar Found Without Enhanced Tail Feathers Design|website=www.pcgs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold dollars===
[[File:STS-93 crew.jpg|thumb|right|The crew of the Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' for STS-93, the mission during which twelve gold Sacagawea dollars were sent into space]]

In 1999, the Mint struck a number of Sacagawea dollars in .9167 fine (22-[[carat (purity)|karat]]) gold.&lt;ref name="gold"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilkes|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2010|title=Special 2000–W Sacagawea Dollars Travel on Space Shuttle|journal=Coin World|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial production of the coins, they were denominated at five dollars in order to help the public distinguish them from their circulating counterparts.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; The plan was to sell gold versions of the coins to collectors.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; On March 20, this plan was halted when some Congressmen questioned the authority of Mint officials to strike the coins in a composition different from what had already been authorized.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; Full-scale coin production never took place even though the Mint maintained that it did have authority to do so, as the coins would be considered numismatic items and not regular-issue coins.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; Similar gold coins were also struck, this time bearing the denomination of one dollar and a "W" [[mint mark]], signifying that the coins were struck at the [[West Point Mint]].&lt;ref name="goldpress"&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?action=press_release&amp;ID=821 United States Mint Displays Never-Before-Seen Gold Space Coins in Milwaukee]. United States Mint. Retrieved January 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 39 such coins were struck, twelve of which were found to be of adequate quality, while the rest were eventually destroyed.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; Unlike those denominated at five dollars, the one dollar pieces were "struck to commemorate the historic flight of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in July 1999", according to Former Mint Director [[Edmund C. Moy|Ed Moy]].&lt;ref name="goldpress"/&gt; The twelve surviving gold dollars were sent into space aboard ''Columbia'' on mission [[STS-93]] in July 1999.&lt;ref name="goldpress"/&gt; Following the return of the shuttle, the coins were placed in storage at [[Fort Knox]], where they remained until 2007, when they were exhibited at the [[American Numismatic Association]] World's Fair of Money in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="goldpress"/&gt; After the event, the coins were returned to Fort Knox; however, the Mint is currently planning to loan the coins to various museums throughout the country.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt;

===Mule error===
In May 2000, an [[Mint-made errors|error coin]] bearing the [[George Washington]] obverse design of a U.S. [[50 State Quarters|state quarter]] and the eagle reverse of a Sacagawea dollar was discovered in a roll of dollar coins purchased from a bank in [[Mountain Home, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="mule"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilkes|first=Paul|date=March 8, 2010|title=Double-Denomination Mule Features Sacagawea $1 Reverse|journal=Coin World|pages=132–133, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mule#11"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gikes|first=Paul|title=11th quarter-dollar/dollar mule surfaces:  Chicago dealer acquires NGC-certified coin|url=http://www.coinworld.com/articles/11th-quarter-dollar-dollar-mule-surfaces/|work=Coin World (11 August 2011)|publisher=Coin World|accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The undated coin, known as a [[Mule (coin)|double-denomination mule]], was the first of eleven discovered and authenticated.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt; Mint officials estimate that the coins, which bear the 'P' mint mark for [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]], were struck from late April to early May 2000.&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt;  They were produced on dollar-coin planchets clad with manganese bronze, not quarter planchets with copper-nickel cladding.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt;

Following the initial discovery, a bin containing several thousand of the error coins was impounded at the Philadelphia Mint,&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt; and all such coins within it were ordered melted.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt; Some of the coins that had been released were eventually tracked back to a [[Coin wrapper|coin-wrapping]] facility near [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt; Employees at the wrapping facility were instructed to watch for any of the coins; those discovered were turned over to the Mint.&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt;

A subsequent [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] investigation into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals.&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt; In 2002, Mint officials announced that two of the ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might be seized.&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt; However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt;

As of August 2011, eight of the eleven error coins, including the one initially discovered in Arkansas, are owned by a New Mexico collector who purchased them between 2000 and 2003, paying as high as $75,000 for a single specimen.&lt;ref name="mule"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Fred Weinberg &amp; Co. |title=2000-P "Mule" Sacagawea Dollar Reverse w/ States Quarter Obverse |url=http://www.fredweinberg.com/mules.php |publisher=Fred Weinberg &amp; Co. |accessdate=September 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112180446/http://www.fredweinberg.com/mules.php |archivedate=November 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the other three documented mules, one is owned by its discoverer, a Missouri collector,&lt;ref name=Weinberg /&gt; another was purchased by an unnamed collector,&lt;ref name=Weinberg /&gt; and the third, first reported in 2011, was purchased in 2011 by a Chicago dealer from an individual who had owned the coin for about ten years.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg /&gt;  Sale prices as high as $200,000 have been reported.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt;  Three different [[die (manufacturing)|die]] combinations have been identified among the eleven available error coins.&lt;ref name="Mule#11"/&gt;

==Reception==

The coin received mixed reviews from the nation's senators. In an interview with [[Associated Press]] columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas described United States currency as "crummy".&lt;ref name="gramm"&gt;{{cite news

Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer.&lt;ref name="lawmakers"/&gt; Texas Republican Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time.&lt;ref name="lawmakers"/&gt; Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation "looks like play money."&lt;ref name="lawmakers"/&gt; Senators [[Mike DeWine]] of Ohio and [[Byron Dorgan]] of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.&lt;ref name="lawmakers"/&gt;

'''Samuel Barclay Beckett''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|k|ɪ|t}}; 13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish [[avant-garde]] novelist, playwright, theatre director, poet, and literary translator who lived in [[Paris]] for most of his adult life. He wrote in both English and French.

Beckett's work offers a bleak, [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] outlook on human existence, often coupled with [[black comedy]] and gallows humor, and became increasingly [[Minimalism|minimalist]] in his later career. He is considered one of the last [[Modernism|modernist]] writers, and one of the key figures in what [[Martin Esslin]] called the "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cakirtas, O. Developmental Psychology Rediscovered: Negative Identity and Ego Integrity vs. Despair in Samuel Beckett's Endgame. International Journal of Language Academy.Volume 2/2 Summer  2014 p. 194/203. http://www.ijla.net/Makaleler/1990731560_13.%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett was awarded the 1969 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for his writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1969|publisher=Nobelprize|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1969/|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected [[Saoi]] of [[Aosdána]] in 1984.

==Early life and education==
Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin on [[Good Friday]], 13 April 1906, to William Frank Beckett, a [[quantity surveyor]] and descendant of the [[Huguenots]], and Maria Jones Roe, a nurse, when both were 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc7.htm |title=Samuel beckett -1906-1989 |publisher=Imagi-nation.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had married in 1901. Beckett had one older brother, Frank Edward Beckett (1902–1954). At the age of five, Beckett attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School in Dublin city centre near Harcourt Street. The Becketts were members of the Anglican [[Church of Ireland]]. The family home, Cooldrinagh in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Foxrock]], was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Samuel's father, William. The house and garden, together with the surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby [[Leopardstown Racecourse]], the Foxrock railway station and  Harcourt Street station at the city terminus of the line, all feature in his prose and plays.

In 1919/1920, Beckett went to [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[County Fermanagh]] (which [[Oscar Wilde]] had also attended). He left 3 years later, in 1923. A natural athlete, Beckett excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later, he was to play for [[Dublin University Cricket Club|Dublin University]] and played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref name="wisden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ireland/content/player/24553.html|title=Samuel Beckett|website=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played first-class cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154150.html|title=Never a famous cricketer|last=Rice|first=Jonathan|year=2001|website=Wisden|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett studied French, Italian, and English at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors was the eminent [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] scholar [[A. A. Luce]], who introduced him to the work of [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colangelo|first1=Jeremy|title=Nothing is Impossible: Bergson, Beckett, and the Pursuit of the Naught|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|date=2017|volume=40|issue=4|page=39|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.40.4.03|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/671605|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and, after teaching briefly at [[Campbell College]] in Belfast, took up the post of ''lecteur d'anglais'' at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris from November 1928 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley and Gontarski, ''Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'', 161&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author [[James Joyce]] by [[Thomas MacGreevy]], a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay entitled "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce".&lt;!-- sic! those periods are correct! See "An exagmination of James Joyce", page 3 --&gt; The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' (a book of essays on Joyce which also included contributions by [[Eugene Jolas]], [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[William Carlos Williams]]). Beckett's close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] owing to her progressing [[schizophrenia]]. Beckett's first short story, "Assumption", was published in Jolas's periodical [[Transition (literary journal)|''transition'']]. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem "Whoroscope", which draws on a biography of [[René Descartes]] that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.

In 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the [[Toulouse]] poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called ''le Concentrisme''. It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be "at odds with all that is clear and distinct in [[Descartes]]". Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Ackerley and S. E. Gontarski, ''The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (New York: Grove Press, 2004), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem "Gnome", which was inspired by his reading of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and eventually published in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' in 1934:

{{quote|Spend the years of learning squandering&lt;br/&gt;Courage for the years of wandering&lt;br/&gt;Through a world politely turning&lt;br/&gt;From the loutishness of learning&lt;ref&gt;"Gnome" from ''Collected Poems''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beckett travelled in Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'', his critical study of French author [[Marcel Proust]]. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with [[Tavistock Clinic]] psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion|Dr. Wilfred Bion]]. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as ''Watt'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuel-beckett.net/speople.html Beckett, Samuel. (1906–1989)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215351/http://samuel-beckett.net/speople.html |date=14 October 2007 }} – Literary Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'', but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 [[Short story|short-story]] collection ''[[More Pricks Than Kicks]]''.

Beckett published essays and reviews, including "Recent Irish Poetry" (in ''[[The Bookman (literary magazine)|The Bookman]]'', August 1934) and "Humanistic Quietism", a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy's ''Poems'' (in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'', July–September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, [[Brian Coffey]], [[Denis Devlin]] and [[Blanaid Salkeld]], despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their [[Celtic Revival]] contemporaries and invoking [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|French symbolists]] as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming "the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland", Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic [[Modernism|modernist]] canon.&lt;ref&gt;''Disjecta'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935—the year that Beckett successfully published a book of his poetry, ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates''—Beckett worked on his novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] at the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in Moscow. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production.  In 1936, a friend had suggested him  to look up the works of [[Arnold Geulincx]], which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in ''Murphy'' and the reading apparently left a strong impression.&lt;ref&gt;The notes that Beckett took have been published and commented in ''Notes de Beckett sur Geulincx'' (2012) ed. N. Doutey, Paris: Les Solitaires Intempestifs, {{ISBN|978-2-84681-350-1}} and ''Arnold Geulincx Ethics With Samuel Beckett's Notes'', ed. H. Van Ruler,  Brill Academic Publishers {{ISBN|9789004154674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Murphy'' was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of ''Murphy'' (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, "France at war to Ireland at peace".&lt;ref&gt;Israel Shenker, "Moody Man of Letters", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 May 1956; quoted in Cronin, 310&lt;/ref&gt; His was soon a known face in and around [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]] cafés, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], with whom he regularly played [[chess]]. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who nicknamed him "Oblomov" (after the character in [[Ivan Goncharov]]'s [[Oblomov|novel]]).&lt;ref&gt;This character, she said, was so looed by apathia that he "finally did not even have the willpower to get out of bed"; quoted in Gussow (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious [[pimp]] (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of [[Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil]], who previously knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: "Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse" ["I do not know, sir. I'm sorry"].&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997)  p261&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker—partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered.

==World War II and French Resistance==
After the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the [[French Resistance]], in which he worked as a courier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Lettres4 See Samuel Beckett, ''Lettres'', I, 1929-1940, Gallimard, Paris, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the [[Gestapo]]. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of [[Roussillon, Vaucluse|Roussillon]], in the [[Vaucluse]] ''département'' in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in the back yard of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]] and the [[Médaille de la Résistance]] by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as "boy scout stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title=The Modern Word |publisher=The Modern Word |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997)  p303&lt;/ref&gt; While in hiding in Roussillon, he continued work on the novel [[Watt (novel)|''Watt'']] (begun in 1941 and completed in 1945, but not published until 1953, though an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|''Envoy'']]).

==Fame: novels and the theatre==
[[File:Samuel Beckett.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Samuel Beckett by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], painted in Paris, 1961 (from the collection of Ken White, Dublin).]]
In 1945, Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother’s room: His entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never best him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I realized that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one’s material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realized that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett, as related by James Knowlson in his biography.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Knowlson argues that "Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss – as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er.'"&lt;ref Name = "Knowlson-p352"/&gt; The revelation "has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career". Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say "clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...", at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are "precious ally".&lt;ref Name = "Knowlson-p352"&gt;Knowlson (1997) p352–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]’s magazine ''Les Temps modernes'' published the first part of Beckett’s short story "''Suite''" (later to be called "''La Fin''", or "The End"), not realizing that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, [[Mercier and Camier|''Mercier et Camier'']], which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work, the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, the novel was Beckett’s first long work that he wrote in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by [[Jérôme Lindon]] director of his parisian publishing house [[Les Éditions de Minuit]], including the [[poioumenon]] "trilogy" of novels: [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951); ''Malone meurt'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1958); ''L'innommable'' (1953), ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1960). Despite being a native English speaker, Beckett wrote in French because—as he himself claimed—it was easier for him thus to write "without style".&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p324&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel Beckett 01-2.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Portrait, circa 1970]]
Beckett is most famous for his play ''[[Waiting for Godot|En attendant Godot]]'' (1953) (''[[Waiting for Godot]]''). In a much-quoted article, the critic [[Vivian Mercier]] wrote that Beckett "has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Times]]'', 18 February 1956, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his works after 1947, the play was first written in French with the title ''En attendant Godot''. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p342&lt;/ref&gt; He published it in 1952 and it premièred in 1953; an English translation appeared two years later. Directed by [[Roger Blin]], the play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and, later, [[Kenneth Tynan]]. In the United States, it flopped in [[Miami]] and had a qualified success in New York City. After this, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. It is frequently performed today.

Beckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of ''Molloy'', for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of ''Waiting for Godot'' opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including ''Fin de partie'' (''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'') (1957), ''Krapp's Last Tape'' (1958, written in English), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961, also written in English), and ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with [[Jorge Luis Borges]].

==Later life and death==
[[File:Beckett-grave-paris.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Samuel Beckett at the Cimetière de [[Montparnasse]]]]
The 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the [[BBC Third Programme]] for a radio play, ''[[All That Fall]].'' He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life.

Beckett bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around {{convert|60|km|mi|-1}} northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.

From the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with [[Barbara Bray]], a widow who worked as a script editor for the [[BBC]]. Knowlson wrote of them: "She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1997) p458-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Bray died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 February 2010.
[[File:"Samuel Beckett" by Javad Alizadeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Samuel Beckett by [[Javad Alizadeh]]]]
In October 1969 while on holiday in [[Tunis]] with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a "catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson (1998) p505.&lt;/ref&gt; In true ascetic fashion, he gave away all of the prize money. While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM St. Jacques in Paris near his Montparnasse home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |title='&amp;#39;Happiest moment of the past half million: Beckett Biography'&amp;#39; |publisher=Themodernword.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817072126/http://www.themodernword.com/beckett/beckett_biography.html |archivedate=17 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster in the 15 December 2011 issue of ''The New Republic'' reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Foster | first = Roy | title = Darkness and Kindness | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97767/beckett-letters-godot-ireland?passthru=YWEzNjliOWUzNTZhNGRmNGQ4MDMwZmNkOTVjYmY2M2E | work = The New Republic | date = 15 December 2011 | accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from [[emphysema]] and possibly [[Parkinson's disease]], Beckett died on 22 December. The two were interred together in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett's directive that it should be "any colour, so long as it's grey".

==Works==
[[File:Samuel Beckett by Edmund S. Valtman ppmsc.07951.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Caricature of Beckett by [[Edmund S. Valtman]]]]  
Beckett's career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett's death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more [[Minimalism|minimalist]].

===Early works===
Beckett's earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection ''[[More Pricks than Kicks]]'' (1934) affords a representative sample of this style:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.&lt;ref&gt;''More Pricks than Kicks'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage makes reference to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'', which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.

Similar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, ''Murphy'' (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and [[Black comedy|black]] [[Gallows humor|humour]] that animate many of Beckett's works: "The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new".&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Watt'', written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a [[permutation|mathematical permutation]], presaging Beckett's later preoccupation—in both his novels and dramatic works—with precise movement.

Beckett's 1930 essay ''[[Proust (Beckett essay)|Proust]]'' was strongly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness—in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in ''Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates'' (1935)—seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in ''Watt''.

===Middle period===

&lt;/poem&gt; |source =From ''[[Watt (novel)|Watt]]'' (1953)&lt;ref&gt;''Watt'' by Beckett quoted in: Booth, Wayne C. (1975)  A rhetoric of irony By Wayne C. Booth Chicago University Press p258 {{ISBN|0-226-06553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the "revelation" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin—in which he realized that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world—that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.

During the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: ''En attendant Godot'' (written 1948–1949; ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''), ''Fin de partie'' (1955–1957; ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''), ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' (1958), and ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961). These plays—which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]"—deal in a [[black comedy|darkly humorous]] way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary [[existentialism|existentialist thinkers]]. The term "Theatre of the Absurd" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and ''Godot'' were centerpieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of [[Albert Camus]]'s concept of "the absurd";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labeled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded [[absurdism|his own philosophy]]). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell—one of the two characters in ''Endgame'' who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak—can best summarize the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more."&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'', 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). In these novels—sometimes referred to as a "trilogy", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes—the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley and Gontarski (2004)  p586&lt;/ref&gt; ''Molloy'', for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a [[detective novel]]. In ''Malone Dies'', movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the "action" of the book takes the form of an [[Inner monologue|interior monologue]]. Finally, in ''The Unnamable'', almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of ''The Unnamable'': 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Novels'', 414&lt;/ref&gt;

After these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief "stories" later collected as ''Texts for Nothing''. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, ''Comment c'est'' (1961; ''How It Is''. An early variant version of ''Comment c'est'', ''L'Image'', was published in the British arts review, [[X (magazine)|''X: A Quarterly Review'']] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.&lt;ref&gt;"L’Image", X: A Quarterly Review, ed. [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]] &amp; [[Patrick Swift]], Vol. I, No. 1, November 1959 [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/beckett/career/howitis/publications.html Beckett Exhibition Harry Ransom Centre University of Texas at Austin]&lt;/ref&gt;). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching [[telegraphese]]: "You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark"&lt;ref&gt;''How It Is'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. ''How It Is'' is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.

Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett's works exhibited an increasing tendency—already evident in much of his work of the 1950s—towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as [[minimalism|minimalist]]. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'', which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', the theatrical [[revue]] for which it served as an introductory piece).&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson  (1997) p501&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel Beckett DCP 1341.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]]]]
In his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters—already few in number in the earlier plays—are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled ''[[Play (play)|Play]]'' (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama ''[[Eh Joe]]'' (1963), which was written for the actor [[Jack MacGowran]], is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play ''[[Not I]]'' (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, "a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Knowlson  (1997) p522&lt;/ref&gt; Following from ''Krapp's Last Tape'', many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in ''Eh Joe'') or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in ''Not I''). Beckett's most politically charged play, ''[[Catastrophe (play)|Catastrophe]]'' (1982), which was dedicated to [[Václav Havel]], deals relatively explicitly with the idea of [[dictatorship]]. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of ''mirlitonnades'', with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including [[Derek Mahon]], have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.

Beckett's prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts ''Fizzles'' (which the American artist [[Jasper Johns]] illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' (1980), which continued with ''[[Ill Seen Ill Said]]'' (1982) and ''[[Worstward Ho]]'' (1984), later collected in ''[[Nohow On]]''. In these three "'closed space' stories,"&lt;ref&gt;''Nohow On'', vii&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of ''Company'' make clear: "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." "To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said."&lt;ref&gt;''Nohow On'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including ''[[Company (short story)|Company]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]]''.

In the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem "What is the Word" ("Comment dire"). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett's earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.

==Collaborators==

===Jack MacGowran===
[[Jack MacGowran]] was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted ''End of Day'' in Dublin in 1962, revising it as ''Beginning To End'' (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970–1971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as ''Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.'' Beckett wrote the radio play ''[[Embers]]'' and the teleplay ''[[Eh Joe]]'' specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]],'' and did several readings of Beckett's plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP, ''MacGowran Speaking Beckett'' for [[Claddagh Records]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://claddaghrecords.com/index.php/jack-macgowran-macgowran-speaking-beckett.html|title=Jack MacGowran - MacGowran Speaking Beckett|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|title=Big City Books - First Editions, Rare, Fanzines, Music Memorabilia - contact|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010607/http://bigcitybooks.com/page6.htm|archivedate=24 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billie Whitelaw===
[[Billie Whitelaw]] worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as ''[[Not I]]'', ''[[Eh Joe]]'', ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'', and ''[[Footfalls]]'' and ''[[Rockaby]].'' She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography ''Billie Whitelaw...: Who He?,'' she describes their first meeting in 1963 was "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in ''[[Not I]]''. She said of the play ''Rockaby'': "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing ''Happy Days'' and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5423443.ece ''The Times Literary Supplement'' 31 December 2008  ''Princes and players''.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/whitelaw.html Whitelaw Biography – State University of New York.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/feb/10/mondaymediasection.classics Guardian article ''Muse'' 10 February 2000.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She said of her role in ''Footfalls'': "I felt like a moving, musical [[Edvard Munch]] painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing ''Footfalls'' he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/sep/01/artsfeatures2 Guardian article ''Plays for today'' 1 September 1999.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out."

===Jocelyn Herbert===
The English stage designer [[Jocelyn Herbert]] was a close friend and influence on Beckett until his death. She worked with him on such plays as ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (their third project) and ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]]. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: "She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the nail on the head. Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this has never been the case with Jocelyn."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/may/08/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 ''Guardian'' article ''Jocelyn Herbert''. 8 May 2003.] Retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Of all the English-language [[modernism|modernists]], Beckett's work represents the most sustained attack on the [[Realism (literature)|realist tradition]]. He opened up the possibility of theatre and fiction that dispense with conventional plot and the unities of time and place in order to focus on essential components of the human condition. [[Václav Havel]], [[John Banville]], [[Aidan Higgins]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Harold Pinter]] and [[Jon Fosse]] have publicly stated their indebtedness to Beckett's example. He has had a wider influence on [[experimental literature|experimental writing]] since the 1950s, from the [[Beat generation]] to the happenings of the 1960s and after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuttingball.com/endgame/essay.php |title="Beginning to End, Ending to Begin".

Many major 20th-century composers including [[Luciano Berio]], [[György Kurtág]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Pascal Dusapin]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Roman Haubenstock-Ramati]] and [[Heinz Holliger]] have created musical works based on Beckett's texts. His work has also influenced numerous international writers, artists and filmmakers including [[Edward Albee]], [[Avigdor Arikha]], [[Paul Auster]], [[J. M. Coetzee]],&lt;ref&gt;These three writers and the artist Arikha cited in ''Beckett Remembering, Remembering Beckett'' (ed. James and Elizabeth Knowlson, New York: Arcade, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Kalich]], [[Douglas Gordon]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Anthony Minghella]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Knowlson (ed.), ''Beckett Remembering, Remembering Beckett'', 280&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damian Pettigrew]]&lt;ref&gt;Cited in ''No Author Better Served: The Correspondence of Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider'' (ed.

Beckett is one of the most widely discussed and highly prized of 20th-century authors, inspiring a critical industry to rival that which has sprung up around James Joyce. He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]], praised him, one for his revelation of absurdity, the other for his works' critical refusal of simplicities; others such as [[Georg Lukács]] condemned him for 'decadent' lack of [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (1961) "Trying to Understand Endgame". ''[[New German Critique]]'', no. 26, (Spring-Summer 1982) p119–150. In ''The Adorno Reader'' ed. Brian O'Connor. [[Blackwell Publishers]]. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Beckett's death, all rights for performance of his plays are handled by the Beckett estate, currently managed by Edward Beckett (the author's nephew). The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett's plays are performed and does not grant licenses to productions that do not adhere to the writer's stage directions.

Historians interested in tracing Beckett's blood line were, in 2004, granted access to confirmed trace samples of his [[DNA]] to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination.

Some of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer [[John Minihan (photographer)|John Minihan]], who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;1998  ''The Royal Academy'' Magazine, the "Image of the century"&lt;/ref&gt; It was the theater photographer John Haynes, however, who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett: it is used on the cover of the Knowlson biography, for instance. This portrait was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where Haynes photographed many productions of Beckett's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhaynesphotography.com/ |title=Photographer John Haynes's website |publisher=Johnhaynesphotography.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[An Post]], the Irish postal service, issued a [[List of people on stamps of Ireland|commemorative stamp]] of Beckett in 1994.
The [[Central Bank of Ireland]] launched two Samuel Beckett Centenary [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)|commemorative coins]] on 26 April 2006: €10 Silver Coin and €20 Gold Coin.

On 10 December 2009, the new bridge across the [[River Liffey]] in Dublin was opened and named the [[Samuel Beckett Bridge]] in his honour. Reminiscent of a harp on its side, it was designed by the celebrated Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], who had also designed the [[James Joyce Bridge]] further upstream opened on [[Bloomsday]] (16 June) 2003. Attendees at the official opening ceremony included Beckett’s niece Caroline Murphy, his nephew Edward Beckett, poet [[Seamus Heaney]] and [[Barry McGovern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/1211/breaking4.htm|title=Samuel Beckett Bridge opens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
is a kind of order in  [[absolute zero|zero-temperature]]  quantum-mechanical states of matter that have  a symmetry and a finite energy gap.

To derive the results in a most-invariant way,  [[renormalization group|renormalization group methods]] are used (leading to equivalence classes corresponding to certain fixed points).&lt;ref name=defspt /&gt; The SPT order  has the following defining properties:

(a) ''distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a phase transition, if the deformation preserves the symmetry''. &lt;br&gt;
(b) ''however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation''.

The above definition works for both bosonic systems and fermionic systems, which leads to the notions of bosonic SPT order and fermionic SPT order.

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], we can say that SPT states
are [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] states ''with a symmetry'' (by contrast: for long-range entanglement see [[topological order]], which is not related to the famous [[EPR paradox]]).
Since short-range entangled states have only trivial [[topological order]]s 
we may also refer the SPT order as Symmetry Protected "Trivial" order.

==Characteristic properties of SPT order==

# The boundary effective theory of a non-trivial SPT state always has pure [[Anomaly matching condition|gauge anomaly]] or mixed gauge-gravity anomaly for the symmetry group.&lt;ref&gt;
Xiao-Gang Wen,
''Classifying gauge anomalies through SPT orders and classifying gravitational anomalies through topological orders''
Phys. Rev. D 88, 045013 (2013); arXiv:1303.1803.
&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the boundary of a SPT state is either gapless or degenerate, regardless how we cut the sample to form the boundary. A gapped non-degenerate boundary is impossible for a non-trivial SPT state.  If the boundary is a gapped degenerate state, the degeneracy may be caused by  spontaneous symmetry breaking and/or (intrinsic) topological order.
# [[Monodromy defects]] in non-trivial 2+1D SPT states carry non-trival statistics&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; of the symmetry group. Monodromy defects are created by twisting the boundary condition along a cut by a symmetry transformation. The ends of such cut are the monodromy defects. For example, 2+1D bosonic Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT states are classified by a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; integer ''m''. One can show that ''n'' identical elementary monodromy defects in a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT state labeled by ''m'' will carry a total Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; quantum number ''2m'' which is not a multiple of ''n''.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between SPT order and (intrinsic) topological order==
SPT states are short-range entangled while topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.
Both intrinsic [[topological order]], and also SPT order, can sometimes have protected [[gapless boundary excitation]]s. The difference is subtle: the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] can be robust against any local perturbations, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are robust only against local perturbations ''that do not break the symmetry''. So the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] are topologically protected, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are ''symmetry protected''.&lt;ref&gt;One should also note the semantical subtleness of the name SPT: "symmetry protected"  does not mean that the stability of the state is  conserved "because of the symmetry", but it is  just meant that the symmetry is ''kept'' by the interactions corresponding to the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

We also know that an intrinsic [[topological order]] has emergent [[fractional charge]], emergent [[fractional statistics]], and emergent [[gauge theory]]. In contrast, a SPT order has no emergent [[fractional charge]]/[[fractional statistics]] for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent [[gauge theory]] (due to its short-range entanglement). Note that the monodromy defects discussed above are not finite-energy excitations in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but defects created by '''modifying''' the Hamiltonian.

==Examples of SPT order==

The first example of SPT order is the [[AKLT|Haldane phase]] of odd-integer-spin chain.&lt;ref&gt;
F. D. M. Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 1153 (1983), Phys.
Lett. 3,464 (1983); I. Affleck and F. D. M. Haldane, Pyhs.
Rev. B 36, 5291 (1987); I. Affleck, J. Phys.: Condens.
Matter. 1, 3047 (1989).
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a SPT phase protected by [[SO(3)]] spin rotation symmetry.&lt;ref name=defspt/&gt; 
(Note that Haldane phases of even-integer-spin chain do not have SPT order.)
A more well known example of SPT order is the [[topological insulator]] of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by [[U(1)]] and [[time reversal symmetry]].

On the other hand, fractional [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall]] states are not SPT states. They are states with (intrinsic) topological order and long-range entanglements.

==Group cohomology theory for SPT phases==

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], one obtains the following general picture of gapped
phases at zero temperature. All gapped zero-temperature phases can be divided into two classes: [[long-range entanglement|long-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with intrinsic [[topological order]]) and [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with no intrinsic [[topological order]]). All short-range entangled phases can be further divided into three classes:  [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix (symmetry breaking order and SPT order can appear together).

It is well known that [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] orders are described by [[group theory]]. For bosonic SPT phases with pure gauge anomalous boundary, it was shown that they are classified by [[group cohomology]] theory:&lt;ref name=spt&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;iTO^{d+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the Abelian group formed by (d+1)D topologically ordered phases that have no non-trivial topological excitations (referred as iTO phases).

From the above results, many new quantum states of matter are predicted, including bosonic topological insulators (the SPT states protected  U(1) and time-reversal symmetry) and  bosonic topological superconductors (the SPT states protected by time-reversal symmetry), as well as many other new SPT states protected by other symmetries.

The phases before "+" come from &lt;math&gt;H^{d+1} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt;. The phases after "+" come from &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{k=1}^d H^k[G,iTO^{d+1-k}]&lt;/math&gt;.
Just like group theory can give us 230 crystal structures in 3+1D, [[group cohomology]] theory can give us various SPT phases in any dimensions with any on-site symmetry groups.

On the other hand, the fermionic SPT orders are described by [[group super-cohomology]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;
Zheng-Cheng Gu, [[Xiao-Gang Wen]],
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2648 Symmetry-protected topological orders for interacting fermions – fermionic topological non-linear sigma-models and a group super-cohomology theory ]
&lt;/ref&gt; So the group (super-)cohomology theory allows us to construct many
SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include  interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

==A complete classification of 1D gapped quantum phases (with interactions)==

Using the notions of [[quantum entanglement]] and SPT order, one can obtain
a complete classification of all 1D gapped quantum phases.

First, it is shown that there is no (intrinsic) [[topological order]] in 1D (''ie'' all 1D gapped states
are short-range entangled).&lt;ref&gt;
F. Verstraete, J. I. Cirac, J. I. Latorre, E. Rico, and M. M.
Wolf, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 140601 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, if the Hamiltonians have no symmetry, all their 1D gapped quantum states belong to one phase—the phase of trivial product states.
On the other hand, if the Hamiltonians do have a symmetry,  their 1D gapped quantum states 
are either [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix.

Such an understanding allows one to classify all 1D gapped quantum phases:&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Xie Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Xiao-Gang Wen, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3745  Classification of Gapped Symmetric Phases in 1D Spin Systems],
Phys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011);
Ari M. Turner, Frank Pollmann, Erez Berg, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4346  Topological Phases of One-Dimensional Fermions: An Entanglement Point of View],
Phys. Rev. B.83.075102 (2011);
Lukasz Fidkowski, Alexei Kitaev, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4138  Topological phases of fermions in one dimension],
Phys. Rev. B.83.075103 (2011);
N. Schuch, D. Perez-Garcia, and I. Cirac, Phys. Rev. B
84, 165139, (2011), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3732 arXiv:1010.3732].
&lt;/ref&gt; All 1D gapped phases are classified by
the following three mathematical objects: &lt;math&gt;(G_H, G_\Psi, H^{2} [G_\Psi , U(1)])&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt; the symmetry group of the ground states, and &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G_\Psi, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; the second [[group cohomology]] class of &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; classifies the projective representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.) If there is no symmetry breaking (''ie'' &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi=G_H&lt;/math&gt;), the 1D gapped phases are classified by the projective representations of symmetry group &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt;.

'''The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc.''' ('''The Bridge''') is an [[United States|American]] theater company based in [[New York City]].  It was incorporated by its Artistic Director, Avra Petrides, in 1980;&lt;ref name="Incorporation 1980"&gt;Certificate of Incorporation, is dated April 21, 1980, and signed by the Secretary of State, Basil Paterson&lt;/ref&gt; and has produced American/International music- theater festivals in the [[South of France]] ([[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region) with American musical-theater artists such as [[Alan Jay Lerner]], lyricist and librettist of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', and [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] screenwriters and lyricists of ''[[Singin' In The Rain]].''&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Depeche, July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; These artists performed and also gave master classes on musical theater to lyricists, librettists, playwrights, composers, directors, and performers from all over the world.  In [[Lower Manhattan]] The Bridge has presented  ''Performance-Forums'' in which theater artists collaborate on productions with astrophysicists, philosophers, architects and others working in a variety of disciplines.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt; Also, in [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge produced ''Hart &amp; Hammerstein Centennial Plus One''  which re-introduced ''[[Castle Clinton]]'' as a noteworthy performance space.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of The Bridge is to further collaborative creation of new theatrical hybrids by spanning different disciplines, cultures and generations; and to provide educational programs in the performing and visual arts.

==Notable productions==
In the [[South of France]], The Bridge presented ''[[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Liz Robertson]] In Concert'', ''[[Honi Coles]] and The Copasetics In Concert'', and ''[[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] In Concert''.&lt;ref name="Int Herald Trib 1984 Jul 25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La Depeche 1982 July 6"&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge has produced its ''Performance-Forums'' with astrophysicist, [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], theater director, [[Tom O'Horgan]] and others.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt;  And in June 2001, it presented ''Hart &amp; Hammerstein Centennial Plus One'' at [[Castle Clinton]], near the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Backstage 2001 Feb 21" /&gt;  The production was the first of a summer concert series, and marked the first time in 146 years that [[Castle Clinton]] had been used as a theater.  [[Castle Clinton]], a {{age|1811|01|01}}-year-old circular stone garrison built in 1811 to protect New York from the warring British, has served as an indoor garden, an opera house, an aquarium, an immigrant landing depot, and the setting in which the "[[Swedish Nightingale]]" [[Jenny Lind]] made her 1850 American debut, courtesy of [[P.T. Barnum]]; also, in recent years, as a ticket booth for ferries to the [[Statue of Liberty]].&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;

==Founder and artistic director==
Avra Petrides, a native New Yorker, is the daughter of pioneering woman orchestral conductor, [[Frédérique Petrides]], and journalist, Peter Petrides, who, for many years was managing editor of the New York City-based, Greek-American newspaper, The National Herald (not to be confused with the newspaper of the same name that was established in 1997).&lt;ref name="Groh 1991" /&gt;

Before becoming Artistic Director of The Bridge, her many appearances as an actress included Honey, the young wife, in the original Broadway production of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (in the matinee company, opposite [[Kate Reid]] and [[Shepperd Strudwick]]);&lt;ref name="NY Herald Trib 1962 Oct 11" /&gt; starring as Leah with [[Joseph Wiseman]] and [[Luther Adler]] in the CBC ([[Canadian Broadcasting Company]]) television adaptation of [[Ansky]]'s ''[[The Dybbuk]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/16976/festival/episode_guide/ Canadian Film Festival May 1, 1961]&lt;/ref&gt; playing [[Bette Davis]] in Adrienne Kennedy's ''A Movie Star Has To Star in Black and White'', directed by [[Joseph Chaikin]] at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]];&lt;ref&gt;"Gavella Orchestrates a Sigh, With the Under-Title A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White" (review), by Arthur Sainer, ''[[Village Voice]]'', November 29, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; appearing as Darlene in the original production of [[Lanford Wilson]]'s ''Balm in Gilead'' directed by [[Marshall W.

== History ==
The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc., was incorporated in New York City in 1980 as a not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref name="Incorporation 1980"/&gt; It was then known as The Bridge American Theater Festival, Inc. In 1995, its title was changed to The Bridge Stage of the Arts, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Certificate of Amendment, filed with the Secretary of State on June 2nd 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Bridge works on a project by project basis.

===Festival in south of France===
''Bridge Productions are always staged in spaces exceptional for their beauty and resonance of the past.'' Although based in Manhattan, in the 1980s, The Bridge produced summer music theater festivals in the south of France, with an emphasis on the American musical theater. Alan Jay Lerner (lyricist, librettist, [[My Fair Lady]], [[Camelot]]), [[Comden and Green]], lyricists-screenwriters [[Singin' In The Rain]], [[Will Rogers Follies]]) tap dancer [[Honi Coles]], ([[Tony Award]] winner, [[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]), [[Virgil Thomson]], (critic and composer, Four Saints in Three Acts), members of the [[American Dance Machine]] and of [[Joseph Chaikin]]'s experimental [[The Open Theater]], and others performed at night and taught master classes during the day. Each summer, through the invitation of The Bridge and the International Theatre Institute,&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre Notes," ''International Theatre Institute USA,'' No. 107, May 1982&lt;/ref&gt; (a branch of [[UNESCO]]), 150 actors, singers, dancers, choreographers, playwrights, composers, directors and lyricists and librettists from, at times, 22 countries including [[France]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Madagascar]], [[United States|America]] and [[Japan]] came to partake free of charge in The Bridge programs. The performances attended by an international audience were sold out.

Surrounded by sunlit vineyards and streams, the festivals' first site, in 1982, was a restored 17th century factory, in the small, medieval township of [[Saint-Chinian]], South of France, ([[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region),  where the uniforms of [[Louis XIV]]'s regiments were once embroidered. In 1984, The Bridge Festival moved to the nearby walled medieval city of [[Beziers]] also in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region of the [[South of France]].

To bring something as high spirited and new as the American musical into these timeless surroundings was thrilling, giving a sense of new in old, of continuity of tradition and the march of time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', July 21, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French publication ''L'information du Spectacle'', June 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', June 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi|La Depeche]]'', June 19, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Marseillaise (journal)|La Marseillaise]]'' [[:fr:La Marseillaise (journal)|(fr)]] de [[Hérault|l'Herault]], July 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper Liberation July 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Marseillaise (journal)|La Marseillaise]]'' [[:fr:La Marseillaise (journal)|(fr)]] de [[Hérault|l'Herault]], June 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', June 26, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[La Dépêche du Midi|La Depeche]]'', July 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]],'' June 24, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]],'' June 11, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 17, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 20, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 22, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 27, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French newspaper ''[[Midi Libre]]'', July 28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

====Betty Comden review excerpted====
[[Betty Comden]] and her partner, [[Adolph Green]], were prolific lyricists and librettists of Broadway and film musicals including ''[[Singin' In The Rain]], [[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]].''  Comden gave The Bridge kudos in 1985.

'The Long Arm of the American Musical Stretches to [[Beziers]]'

&amp;hellip; It is not unusual for American musicals to appear in [[London]] &amp;hellip; nor is it strange that ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' is a smash in [[Budapest]], but just why were 50 assorted voices of musical workshop members belting out the song "Just in Time" one morning in July in the vaulted 11th century cloister of Sainte-Aphrodise in the relatively small town of [[Beziers]] (population 100,00) somewhere in the southwest of France!

'Just in time, I found you just in time &amp;hellip;' was issuing from throats that had traveled from [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Israel]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania|Rumania]], [[New Jersey]] and several other of the United States, only because my partner [[Adolph Green]] and I were using that song we had written with [[Jule Styne]] for the show ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells are Ringing]]'' as an example of a certain kind of theatrical-musical moment.  It pleased us to learn that most of the international group of students seemed to know, or at least know of the song.  They spontaneously sang along, their voices echoing, perhaps as far as the foothills of the Pyrenees. Ah your music, your theater, she is indeed the international language, no?

&amp;hellip;The concept of The Bridge, a yearly workshop and festival devoted to the American musical, to be located in France &amp;hellip; was to be literally a bridge between countries and cultures to disseminate knowledge on the subject by assembling "stagères", working participants from all over the globe, and bringing over from America leading practitioners of [[musical theater]] to do the disseminating.  Her dream was that some day in the future, for example, if [[Hal Prince]] wanted to experiment with Japanese [[Noh]] players, working with a Swedish lyricist, a Yugoslavian composer, and a Bessarabian choreographer, such an international collaboration would be assembled under the auspices of The Bridge.  This is but a facetious example of the possibilities.  Avra Petrides has a strong and sincere feeling about the need for open communication through the arts among the many diverse cultures of our all too unpeaceful world, and hopes The Bridge will help.&lt;ref name="Dramatists Guild 1985 Spring" /&gt;}}

=== Performance-Forums ===
In 1996, in [[Lower Manhattan]], The Bridge initiated its ''Performance- Forums'' in the [[Art Deco]] "Cocoa" building at No.1 Wall Street.  In this series, American/international theater artists collaborate with astrophysicists, sculptors, theologians, philosophers, poets, novelists, painters, musicians, choreographers, filmmakers, and others working in a variety of creative, scientific and intellectual disciplines.  The aim: to better understand each other's endeavors and find new and exciting ways to combine them in stage production. The theme of the initial Performance-Forum was ''Time'' (as perceived by people in different disciplines and cultures.)

For several months prior to this event these people collaborated on a performance based on that theme:
* [[Tom O'Horgan]], Theater director of the Broadway productions ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''Lenny'', ''Inner City''; director for the [[Vienna State Opera]], [[New York City Opera]]; and co-author of ''Senator Joe'' at the [[Neil Simon Theater]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].
* [[Neil de Grasse Tyson]], Ph.D. Astrophysicist and Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]].
* Michael Sherman, A futurist, who was advising governments and corporations on their long-range plans. He has made a comparative study of images of time in modern culture.

This debut ''Performance-Forum'', given on March 28, 1996, was attended by approximately two hundred artists, scientists and philosophers, who, at its conclusion, participated in the ''Forum'', which took the form of a panel-led discussion on the evening's theme ''Time''.&lt;ref name="Time Out 1996 Mar 27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Notes 1996 Sum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[WQXR-FM]] initiative, ''Action for the Arts'' featured The Bridge ''Performance - Forums'' in public service announcements made by The Bridge's Artistic Director, Avra Petrides (on [[WQXR-FM]]) and they were featured in their ''Action for the Arts'' "catalog" which detailed the work of 96 organizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;archival video tape of the entire event, held by The Bridge Stage of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Castle Clinton redux ===
In addition, in 1996, The Bridge re-introduced the beautiful 19th century reddish circular stone structure in Historic [[Battery Park]], [[Castle Clinton]], as a remarkable performance space, with the production, ''Hart and Hammerstein Centennial Plus One''. An evening of song, it was hosted by [[CBS]]' [[Charles Osgood]], and featured leading singers and Rob Fisher, then musical director of the [[Encores!]] series at the [[New York City Center]]. It was the first performance at [[Castle Clinton]] since the mid-1800s when, as an opera house, it was the [[Lincoln Center]] of its day, attracting impresarios like [[P.T. Barnum]] and performers like [[Jenny Lind]]. For the Hart &amp; Hammerstein production, The Bridge brought in Broadway theater technicians who, by working into the wee hours of the night before the performance, erected a 30&amp;nbsp;inch high, spacious stage, and to guard against the possibility of rain bringing the performance to a close, covered the roof opening with a translucent white tent.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1996 Jun 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Lifestyles 1996 Jun 3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Castle Clinton]] &amp;hellip; Rising in the East," ''[[New York Magazine]],'' June 3, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Robert Moses ''vs.'' Castle Clinton ====
In 1941, the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Park Commissioner]], [[Robert Moses]], wanted to raze [[Castle Clinton]], claiming it was essential to building a crossing from [[Battery Park|the Battery]] to [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Caro 1974"&gt;''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'', by [[Robert Caro|Robert A. Caro]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] (1974); {{OCLC|834874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests from historic preservationists and others brought this plan to a halt but not before the roof had been removed.

{{italic title}}
[[File:Claude Monet - The Seine at Argenteuil 1873.jpg|thumb|''The Seine at Argenteuil'', 1873]]
'''''The Seine at Argenteuil''''' is an 1873 oil painting by [[Claude Monet]], one of a series of paintings the artist made of the area.

The painting is held in a private collection.

==In popular culture==
''The Seine at Argenteuil'' was featured in and provided (along with other Monet paintings) the title inspiration for the 2001 film ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''. In the film the main character, David ([[Tom Cruise]]), owns the painting, and his subconscious makes use of its depiction of the sky.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">{{about|the European folktale|the novel by Eowyn Ivey|The Snow Child}}
'''''The Snow-child''''' is a widespread European folktale,&lt;ref name="ashliman"&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman]], ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1362.html The Snow Child: folktales of type 1362]''&lt;/ref&gt;   found in many medieval tellings.&lt;ref name="lies"/&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 1362.&lt;ref name="ashliman"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
A merchant returns home after an absence of two years to find his wife with a newborn son. She explains one snowy day she swallowed a snowflake while thinking about her husband which caused her to conceive. Pretending to believe, he raises the boy with her until he takes the boy on a trip and sells him into [[slavery]]. On his return, he explains to his wife that the boy melted in the heat.&lt;ref name="fabliau"&gt;Nicolas Balachov, (1984). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HeY9wVDpM80C&amp;pg=PA30. Le developpement des structures narratives du fabliau a la nouvelle]". in Gabriel Bianciotto, Michel Salvat. ''Épopée animale, fable, fabliau''. Publication Univ Rouen Havre. pp. 30-32.. {{ISBN|978-2-13-038255-3}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
The tale appears in Medieval [[fabliau]]x,&lt;ref name="fabliau"/&gt; and was used in school exercises of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;Jan M. Ziolkowski ''Fairy Tales from Before Fairy Tales: The Medieval Latin Past of Wonderful Lies'' p 42 {{ISBN|9780472033799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It first appears in the 11th-century [[Cambridge Songs]].&lt;ref name="lies"/&gt;  A Medieval play about the [[Virgin Mary]] has characters disbelieving her story of her pregnancy citing the tale.&lt;ref name="lies"/&gt; 

It contrasts to Aarne-Thompson type 703*, [[Snow Maiden]], where a child really has a magical snow-related origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman]], ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0703.html  The Snow Maiden: foltales of type 703*]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Welsh Group''' ({{lang-cy|Y Grŵp Cymreig}}) is an artists' collective, with the purpose of exhibiting and "giving a voice" to the visual arts in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="50 years"&gt;Peter Wakelin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aXYySHER7x8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=50+Years+of+the+Welsh+Group.+Peter+Wakelin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IF8vUcqiBoe50QWNxYDQCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA “50 years of the Welsh Group"], National Museum of Wales (1999), {{ISBN|0-7200-0472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
The group began in 1948 as the South Wales Group, consisting of both professional and amateur artists.&lt;ref name="60 creative years"&gt;Karen Price, [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/news/2008/11/21/art-group-marking-60-creative-years-91466-22306900/ "Art group marking 60 creative years"], WalesOnline, 21 November 2008. Retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planet Mapping"&gt;David Moore, [http://www.planetmagazine.org.uk/html/newsite/onlinedetails/The_Welsh_Group.html Mapping the Welsh Group at Sixty: The Exhibition], Planet Online. Retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=1513&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1386&amp;cHash=8e57b2d7d9bdf30aa36c37d7d06e3731&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"&gt;http://www.rcaconwy.org/content/uploads/documents/celf_issue7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The group's initial conception was a response to the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art|Royal Cambrian Academy's]] relatively weak representation from [[south Wales]] at that time.&lt;ref name="welshgroup-art.com"&gt;http://www.welshgroup-art.com/?page_id=10&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword to the South Wales Group’s first exhibition catalogue, David Bell wrote “It is the purpose of the Group to establish a new link between the artists of South Wales and their public".&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt;

During the 1960s the South Wales Group had begun exhibiting further afield in [[North Wales|north]] and [[mid Wales]] and into [[Bristol]] and [[Shrewsbury]]. The group adopted its current, broader title of The Welsh Group by 1975,&lt;ref name="50 years"/&gt; by which time it had also become a fully professional artists' group and, though its south east tendency is still an issue of some contention, the group had expanded its membership beyond south Wales&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt; (including a number who are also members of the Royal Cambrian Academy and/or the splinter group initiated in 1956 when the South Wales Group failed to become a southern Academy; the [[56 Group Wales]]).&lt;ref name="50 years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt;

==21st century==
An exhibition curated and researched by Welsh Group member Dr Ceri Thomas and funded by [[The National Library of Wales]], [[Arts Council of Wales]], Contemporary Art Society for Wales&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casw.org.uk/english/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and the Welsh Group, was launched at the National Library of Wales, ([[Aberystwyth]]), before touring to the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art|Royal Cambrian Academy]], and [[Newport Museum|Newport Museum &amp; Art Gallery]]. The exhibition, ''Mapping The Welsh Group at 60'', included work by current and past members spanning a period from soon after the [[World War II|second world war]] to work completed in the twenty-first century, just after [[Government of Wales Act 1998|Welsh devolution]]. At the exhibition launch [[Welsh Government]] Heritage Minister at the time [[Alun Ffred Jones]] highlighted the group's importance: "The Welsh Group's 60th anniversary exhibition is a major event for the arts in Wales, bringing together work from talented Welsh artists old and new".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id%3D1514%26no_cache%3D1%26tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D1455%26cHash%3D8449e65004bab1c67d28b5466ad80b22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706101457/http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=1514&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1455&amp;cHash=8449e65004bab1c67d28b5466ad80b22 |archivedate=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fully illustrated colour book published by Diglot Books accompanied the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9780956086709}} (0956086705)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwales.com/goto/biblio/en/9780956086709/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
See [[:Category:Members of The Welsh Group]].

Full membership is made up of approximately 40 Welsh or Wales-based artists&lt;ref name="Planet Mapping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt; including a chair (Dilys Jackson), secretary (David James) and treasurer (Heather Eastes). A list of current members can be found on the right-hand info. box.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denbighshire.gov.uk/en-gb/DNAP-8Q8LV5&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, with the deaths of a number of long lasting members, new members were elected, resulting in a greater gender balance and an increase in members from outside [[Cardiff]].
From 2007 until 2009 the group also included a young graduate member&lt;ref name="rcaconwy.org"/&gt; and in 2012 artist Tiff Oben began a three-year Fellowship with the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://elbowroomintercourse.blogspot.co.uk/p/project-artists.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathew Prichard [[CBE]] is the group's president.&lt;ref name="welshgroup-art.com"/&gt;

'''Wesley Lawrence Willis''' (May 31, 1963&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;August 21, 2003) was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and [[visual arts|visual artist]]. Diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] in 1989, Willis began a career as an [[underground music|underground]] [[singer-songwriter]] in the [[outsider music]] tradition, with songs featuring his bizarre, humorous and often obscene lyrics sung over the [[Electronic keyboard#Concepts and definitions|auto accompaniment]] feature on his [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] KN [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]].&lt;ref name=joyrides&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wesleywillissjoyrides.com/WesleyWillisBio.htm |title=Wesley Willis's Joy Rides · Wesley Willis Bio |publisher=Wesleywillissjoyrides.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231454/http://wesleywillissjoyrides.com/WesleyWillisBio.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alttent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419030840/http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-04-19 |title=Bands |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ymarks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ymarksthespot.org/2010/07/31/say-rah-discussing-the-daddy-of-rock-n-roll-with-the-directors-of-wesley-williss-joy-rides-2/ |title=Say Rah!

Willis gained a large [[cult following]] in the 1990s, particularly after the release of his 1995 ''Greatest Hits'' album on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] label. [[Jello Biafra]] compiled the album's track list.&lt;ref name=alttent /&gt;&lt;ref name=ymarks /&gt; In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own [[punk rock]] band, the [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]], during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ymarks /&gt; He was also a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings,&lt;ref name=ymarks /&gt; most of them of various Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on the street for between $20 and $40.&lt;ref name=joyrides /&gt;

Despite his mainly underground career, Willis has influenced a variety of media: for example, music software company [[Nullsoft]] took their slogan "It really whips the llama's ass!" for [[Winamp]] from Willis's song "Whip The Llama's Ass".&lt;ref name="AutoMZ-17"&gt;DEMO.MP3 15,592 bytes, 32 kbit/s, 22 kHz, recorded in "1997" "Exclusively for Nullsoft" by JJ McKay.

==Life and career==
Willis was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on May 31, 1963, to Walter&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Michael|title=Blue-Eyed Devil: A Road Odyssey Through Islamic America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqEXqPXNKmcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Blue-Eyed+Devil:+A+Road+Odyssey+Through+Islamic+America+wesley+willis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo96SKoK_XAhUKrFQKHQovAeoQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Wesley%20Willis&amp;f=false|date=March 26, 2009|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=9781593763510|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Annie Willis.&lt;ref name="copel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/11/24/songs-in-his-head/f728dfbe-4f72-41a8-b02f-efb8663c3dec/|title=Songs in His Head|last=Copel|first=Lib|date=November 24, 2000|work=Washington Post|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "Willis grew up in Chicago's [[Public housing|projects]] as one of 10 children of parents who had a violent relationship and separated when he was young; he spent time in several foster homes and was essentially raised by two older brothers, who went with him from home to home."&lt;ref name ="LAT1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=August 25, 2003 |title=Wesley Willis, 40; Schizophrenic Found 'Joy' as Rock Performer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/25/local/me-willis25 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location=Los Angeles |access-date=July 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis began [[schizophrenia|hearing voices]] during a period of living at his mother's home in the 1980s, when her boyfriend held a gun to his head and robbed him of $100 Willis had saved.&lt;ref name="Chusid"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chusid|first=Irwin|title=Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT9dnDaFdX8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Songs+in+the+Key+of+Z:+The+Curious+Universe+of+Outsider+Music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYmIL7oa_XAhVpqlQKHSD2ApgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Wesley%20Willis&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781569764930|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1980s, he was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]]&lt;ref name="voice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://digitalcommons.conncoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=ccnews_2001_2002|title=El 'N' Gee Hosts Head-Butting Superstar Wesley Willis|last=Cunningham|first=Taylor|date=September 28, 2001|work=The College Voice|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and institutionalized for two months after his diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Daddy"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll|last=Bitton|first=Daniel|date=April 22, 2003|publisher=Mvd Visual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During childhood, Willis developed an interest in art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago [[public-access television|public access]] documentary feature entitled ''Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets|last=Hart|first=Carl|publisher=Chicago Public Access TV|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Artist of the Streets'', he was shown walking through Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] neighborhood, producing his [[fountain pen|ink pen]] drawings outside of the [[Marshall Field and Company Building]], and interacting with people curious about his art.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis was known for his ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the one in which he was sitting.&lt;ref name="Daddy"/&gt; During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the [[Mohamed Khalil Museum]] of Egypt, and he was the subject of a special exhibit entitled ''Drawn By Wesley Willis'' at [[Dominican University (Illinois)|Dominican University]].&lt;ref name="avc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/its-drawn-by-wesley-willis,520/|title=It's drawn by Wesley Willis|last=Wolinsky|first=David|date=February 21, 2008|work=The A.V. Club Chicago|accessdate=12 March 2012}} {{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, after befriending some musicians from Chicago's alternative rock scene and recording several solo albums, he formed the punk rock band The [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]]. The band developed a popular underground following as well as attention from musicians such as [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Mike D.]], [[Jello Biafra]], and the members of [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]];&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7023&amp;context=bg-news|title=Wesley Willis Fiasco uses music for inner peace|last=Weisbrod|first=Aaron|date=June 26, 1996|work=The BG News|page=6|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon caught the attention of [[Rick Rubin]] at [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]],&lt;ref name="BG"/&gt; an independent label distributed by [[Warner Bros.|The Warner Group]]. In early 1994, Willis recorded with the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[industrial music|industrial]]-[[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Monster Voodoo Machine]] and appeared on their Juno Award-winning debut album ''Suffersystem'' ([[RCA Records]]). In 1995, American Recordings signed Willis as a solo musician; the Wesley Willis Fiasco subsequently broke up in 1996. He went on to record numerous solo albums of [[novelty song|novelty rock]] (two for American Recordings and the remainder for several independent labels or recorded, marketed and released independently by Willis himself), toured frequently, and was profiled on [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1477150/wesley-willis-schizophrenic-street-singer-dies/|title=Wesley Willis, Schizophrenic Street Singer, Dies|work=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 1996, he was a guest on ''[[Howard Stern|The Howard Stern Show]]'' where he played nearly identical songs about [[Baba Booey]] and [[Howard Stern]]. During his many tours and live appearances, Willis became "famous for greeting fans with a headbutt"; this left him with a distinctive permanent bruise on his forehead.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt;

In early 2003 the documentary ''[[The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll]]'' was released, chronicling Willis' daily life and interests.

On August 21, 2003, Willis died due to complications from [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] in [[Skokie, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=alttent /&gt;

In 2013, a supporting character named Milan was introduced for the ongoing [[Wonder Woman]] comic. A blind demigod with the power of far-sight and half-brother to Wonder Woman, his physical appearance and mannerisms are based on Wesley Willis.&lt;ref name ="hufpo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/07/wesley-willis-wonder-woma_n_2639862.html|title=Wesley Willis Wonder Woman: Iconic Artist Appears In New DC Comic As Heroine's Half-Brother|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song structure and themes==
"Hellride" is the term used by Willis to describe his encounters with "[[demon]]s",&lt;ref name=monzy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monzy.org/wesley/ |title=Wesley Willis |publisher=Monzy.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which occurred mainly on the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] bus lines in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Daddy"/&gt; According to Willis, his demons were trying to ruin his "Harmony Joy Music" or "Joy Rides".&lt;ref name=alttent /&gt; He uses the term in many of his songs, such as "I Deserve a Warhellride".

The [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]] songs were [[punk rock]] songs with Willis howling his obscene, absurd rants as lyrics. The band recorded three cover songs: [[Thin Lizzy]]'s "Jailbreak",&lt;ref name="hbd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=207448 |title=Various Artists: Vagabonds of the Midwestern World: Fighting Songs by Thin Lizzy - A - HBDirect Rock |publisher=Hbdirect.com |date=2003-01-03 |accessdate=2013-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030604/http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=207448 |archive-date=2014-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pure Prairie League]]'s "[[Bustin' Out|Amie]]", and [[Duran Duran]]'s "[[Girls on Film]]", the last of which was recorded for a 1997 Duran Duran [[tribute album]]. Another song by the Wesley Willis Fiasco, "The Bar Is Closed", recreates a section of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s "Tom Sawyer"; the song "Casper the Homosexual Friendly Ghost" does the same with [[Van Halen]]'s "Jamie's Cryin'".

As a solo artist, Willis filled his albums with funny, bizarre, tense, and often obscene statements about crime, fast food, cultural trends, bus routes, violent confrontations with [[superhero]]es, commands for his "demons" to engage in [[bestiality]] (in ''[[The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll]]'', Willis explained that these songs would "gross out" the demons enough to leave him alone),&lt;ref name="Daddy"/&gt; and praise for his favorite actors, friends, politicians, and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[rock music|rock]] artists. Songs about rock artists were usually confined to describing a show performed by the band that Willis had attended or opened for, recycling key phrases such as "The crowd roared like a lion," "A lot of people met the band," or "The band got down like a [[Magikist]]". Many songs end with the phrase "Rock over [[London]], rock on, Chicago," followed by a product slogan, such as "[[Wheaties]]. Breakfast of Champions" or "[[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]]. Wow! What a difference."

Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote that despite Willis' prolific output his songs were essentially variations on the same simple structure, melody and lyrical themes. He also questioned record company motives for releasing albums by Willis: "It's certainly admirable that Willis has decided to not be tied down by his schizophrenia, but it often seems that his audience is laughing at him, not with him."&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/album/feel-the-power-mw0000648886&lt;/ref&gt; Erlewine also wrote that listening to a Willis record felt "exploitive".&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt;

'''Āina-kāri'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aina-kari-mosaic-of-mirror-glass&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|آینه‌کاری}}) is a kind of [[interior decoration]] by putting small pieces of mirror together in [[geometric]] forms or in forms of flowers and shrubs. By this art, a craftsman creates a beautiful shining space in a building with cut mirrors in various forms. The reflex of light through numberless formed mirror pieces gives out brightness and effulgence. Beside the decoration use, this art is used as a strong durable cover for an interior space of a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= |last=Moein|title=Farhang-e Moein|trans-title=Moein Persian Dictionary|publisher=|isbn=|editor-first=|editor-last=|page=|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
