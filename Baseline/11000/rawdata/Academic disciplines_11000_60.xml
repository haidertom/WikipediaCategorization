'''ATOMKI''' is the  '''Institute for Nuclear Research, [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]'''. The institute was established in 1954 by [[Sándor Szalay (physicist)|Sándor Szalay]] the founder director.

ATOMKI became independent from the Institute of Experimental Physics of the Kossuth Lajos University (presently called [[University of Debrecen]]), where Sándor Szalay started and directed [[nuclear physics]] research for decades. At present, the main research fields of Atomki are atom-, nuclear-, and particle physics, ion beam analytics, technique of detection and signal processing, environmental analytics, radioactive dating, radiochemistry, and solid state physics. The director is Zsolt Dombrádi, [[Doctor of Sciences|D.Sc.]].

Some of its buildings were originally the National Orphanage for Teachers' Children, built in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Old photos|url=http://www.atomki.hu/regi_kepek/index_en.html|work=ATOMKI|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optical astronomy]], [[interferometry]] is used to combine signals from two or more [[telescope]]s to obtain measurements with higher resolution than could be obtained with either telescopes individually.  This technique is the basis for astronomical interferometer arrays, which can make measurements of very small astronomical objects if the telescopes are spread out over a wide area. If a large number of telescopes are used a picture can be produced which has [[Angular resolution|resolution]] similar to a single telescope with the diameter of the combined spread of [[telescopes]]. These include [[radio telescope]] arrays such as [[Very Large Array|VLA]], [[VLBI]], [[Submillimeter Array|SMA]], [[LOFAR]] and [[Square Kilometre Array|SKA]], and more recently{{When|date=February 2011}}  [[Optical interferometry#Astronomical optical interferometry|astronomical optical interferometer arrays]] such as [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST)|COAST]], [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer|NPOI]] and [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array|IOTA]], resulting in the highest resolution optical images ever achieved in astronomy. The [[Very Large Telescope|VLT Interferometer]] is expected to produce its first images using [[aperture synthesis]] soon, followed by other interferometers such as the [[CHARA array]] and the [[Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer]] which may consist of up to 10 optical telescopes. If outrigger telescopes are built at the [[Keck Interferometer]], it will also become capable of interferometric imaging.

==Types of interferometers==

Astronomical interferometers come in two types—direct detection and heterodyne. These differ only in the way that the signal is transmitted. Aperture synthesis can be used to computationally simulate a large telescope aperture from either type of interferometer.

In the near future other arrays are expected to release their first interferometric images, including the [[Infrared Spatial Interferometer|ISI]], [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]I, the [[CHARA array]] and the [[Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer|MRO]] interferometers.

At the beginning of the 21st Century, the VLTI and Keck Interferometer large-telescope arrays came into operation, and the first interferometric measurements of the brightest few extra-galactic targets were performed.

The elements create a 1/4 wave delay in the light, allowing the phase and amplitude of the interference ''visibility'' to be measured, thus giving information about the shape of the light source.
| valign="top" | A single large telescope with an [[Aperture Masking Interferometry|aperture mask]] over it (labelled '''Mask'''), only allowing light through two small holes. The optical paths to detectors 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the same as in the left-hand figure, so this setup will give identical results. By moving the holes in the aperture mask and taking repeated measurements, images can be created using aperture synthesis, which would have the same quality as ''would have been given'' by the right-hand telescope ''without'' the aperture mask. In an analogous way, the same image quality can be achieved by moving the small telescopes around in the left-hand figure – this is the basis of aperture synthesis, using widely separated small telescopes to simulate a giant telescope.

== Astronomical direct-detection interferometry ==

One of the first astronomical interferometers was built on the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]'s reflector telescope in order to measure the diameters of stars. This method was extended to measurements using separated telescopes by Johnson, Betz and Towns (1974) in the infrared and by [[Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie|Labeyrie]] (1975) in the visible. The red giant star [[Betelgeuse]] was among the first to have its diameter
determined in this way. In the late 1970s improvements in computer processing allowed for the first "fringe-tracking" interferometer, which operates fast enough to follow the blurring effects of astronomical seeing, leading to the Mk I, II and III series of interferometers. Similar techniques have now been applied at other astronomical telescope arrays, such as the [[Keck Interferometer]] and the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]].

Techniques from [[VLBI|Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)]], in which a large aperture is synthesized computationally, were implemented at optical and infrared wavelengths in the 1980s by the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]]. The use of this technique provided the first very high resolution images of nearby stars. In 1995 this technique was demonstrated on [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope|an array of separate optical telescopes]] as a Michelson Interferometer for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and allowing even higher resolution [https://web.archive.org/web/19971021083400/http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/telescopes/coast/astronomy.html#supergiants02-04 imaging of stellar surfaces]. The same technique has now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays, including the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]] and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array|IOTA]] array and soon the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]I, [[CHARA array]] and [[Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer|MRO Interferometer]]s.

Projects are now beginning that will use interferometers to search for [[extrasolar planets]], either by astrometric measurements of the reciprocal motion of the star (as used by the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] and the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]I) or through the use of nulling (as will be used by the [[Keck Interferometer]] and [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]]).

A detailed description of the development of astronomical optical interferometry can be found [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/2309/page1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:32:14  here]. Impressive results were obtained in the 1990s, with the [[Mark III Interferometer|Mark III]] measuring diameters of hundreds of stars and many accurate stellar positions, COAST and NPOI producing many very high resolution images, and [[Infrared Spatial Interferometer|ISI]] measuring stars in the mid-infrared for the first time. Additional results included direct measurements of the sizes of and distances to [[Cepheid]] variable stars, and [[young stellar objects]].

Interferometers are seen by most astronomers as very specialized instruments, as they are capable of a very limited range of observations. It is often said that an interferometer achieves the effect of a telescope the size of the distance between the apertures; this is only true in the limited sense of [[angular resolution]]. The combined effects of limited aperture area and atmospheric turbulence generally limit interferometers to observations of comparatively bright stars and [[active galaxy|active galactic nuclei]]. However, they have proven useful for making very high precision measurements of simple stellar parameters such as size and position ([[astrometry]]) and for imaging the nearest [[giant star]]s. For details of individual instruments, see the [[list of astronomical interferometers at visible and infrared wavelengths]].

=== Astronomical heterodyne interferometry ===

Radio wavelengths are much longer than optical wavelengths, and the observing stations in radio astronomical interferometers are correspondingly further apart. The very large distances do not always allow any usable transmission of radio waves received at the telescopes to some central interferometry point. For this reason many telescopes instead record the radio waves onto a storage medium. The recordings are then transferred to a central correlator station where the waves are interfered. Historically the recordings were analog and were made on magnetic tapes. This was quickly superseded by the current method of digitizing the radio waves, and then either storing the data onto computer hard disks for later shipping, or streaming the digital data directly over a telecommunications network e.g. over the Internet to the correlator station. Radio arrays with a very broad bandwidth, and also some older arrays, transmit the data in analogue form either electrically or through fibre-optics. A similar approach is also used at some [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre]] and [[infrared]] interferometers, such as the [[Infrared Spatial Interferometer]]. Some early radio interferometers operated as [[intensity interferometer]]s, transmitting measurements of the signal intensity over electrical cables to a central correlator. A similar approach was used at optical wavelengths by the [[Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer]] to make the first large-scale survey of stellar diameters in the 1970s.

At the correlator station, the actual interferometer is synthesized by processing the digital signals using correlator hardware or software. Common correlator types are the FX and XF correlators. The current trend is towards software correlators running on consumer PCs or similar enterprise hardware. There also exists some amateur radio astronomy digital interferometers, such as the ALLBIN of [[the European Radio Astronomy Club]].

As most radio astronomy interferometers are digital they do have some shortcomings due to the sampling and quantization effects as well as the need for much more computing power when compared to analog correlation. The output of both a digital and analog correlator can be used to computationally synthesize the interferometer aperture in the same way as with direct detection interferometers (see above).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8860">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''''Brown–Peterson task''''' (or '''''Brown–Peterson procedure''''') refers to a cognitive exercise purposed for testing the limits of [[working memory|working memory capacity]]. The task is named for two notable experiments published in the 1950s in which it was first documented, the first by John Brown&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task aims to test the quantity of objects that can be held in working memory while preventing participants from using [[mnemonics]] or other memory techniques separate from the working memory to increase recall capacity.  In the experiment, participants view a sequence of three-letter constructs called trigrams, and are asked to perform simple algebraic computations such as counting backwards by 3s from 999 between each trigram.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt; A trigram consists of 3 [[morpheme|non-morphemic]] letters, the importance of which is that each letter represents a different independent object to be stored in working memory; therefore, trigrams avoid letter combinations that depict words or common acronyms. The algebraic computations are administered between trigrams to assure the participant isn't using mnemonic strategies to [[Chunking (psychology)|chunk]] the letters into a single object.  Variants of the Brown–Peterson task are still used today, all with the same fundamental concept of administering items for the participant to remember whilst preventing the usage of additional cognitive resources to augment working memory.&lt;ref name="pubmed"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Procedure ==

The Brown–Peterson task refers to two studies published in the late 1950s that used similar procedures, one in 1958 by John Brown&lt;ref name=JB /&gt; and a second in 1959 by Lloyd and Margaret Peterson.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt;

The first experiment involved 24 psychology students at [[Indiana University]] at the time. The examiner proceeded by spelling a random three-letter nonsense syllable and then enunciating immediately afterwards a random three-digit number. The subject would then count backwards by some assigned number, either three or four, from the enunciated number.

After a set interval, a light signal was flashed to prompt the subject to cease verbally counting and to recall the random, three-letter nonsense syllable. The time interval between the enunciation by the examiner of the nonsense syllable (exposure to the syllable) and the signal prompt to the participant was known as the recall interval; the time interval between the signal prompt and the enunciation of the third letter by the participant was known as a latency.
In order to maintain [[reproducibility]] of results, each participant was tested eight times using each recall interval, which were 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 seconds. In addition, each nonsense syllable appeared an equal amount of times; the trials were split evenly in terms of counting by either three or four. No successive items contained the same letters, and the time between signal for recall and the next trial was always 15 seconds. In addition, the examiner and participant were instructed to enunciate in rhythm with a 120 BPM metronome, such that two letters or numbers were spoken per second.

The second experiment involved 48 psychology students from Indiana University. The exact procedure from the first experiment was followed for 24 of the students, but the other 24 were asked to repeat the stimulus (i.e., the nonsense syllable) aloud until the examiner stated the three-digit number. Therefore, the only difference between the two experiments was that there was a variable gap between the examiner's enunciation of the stimulus and the number, during which maintenance rehearsal took place. The inspiration behind this experiment was Brown's disbelief that repetition would strengthen the 'memory trace. The purpose of the second experiment was basically to prove or disprove this notion. However, the analysis of the study concluded that forgetting was found to progress at differential rates dependent upon the amount of rehearsal that took place'.&lt;ref name=MP /&gt;

== Interference ==
{{main article|Interference theory}}
There are two types of interference:

'''Retroactive interference''': This type of interference occurs when new information disrupts the recall of old information.

'''Proactive interference''': This type of interference occurs when old information disrupts the recall of new information.

Proactive interference affects participant performance in the Brown–Peterson task. The first time the students participate in the task, they show little loss of information.&lt;ref name=Revlin&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after multiple trials, the task becomes increasingly challenging when letters from the early trials are confused with letters in the current trial. 
Fortunately, proactive interference can be hindered if the information to be remembered is changed to a different type of information. For example, in the Brown–Peterson task there appeared to be little proactive interference when the participants switched from recalling letters to recalling numbers.&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt;

== Rehearsal ==

A key aspect of the Brown–Peterson task is the fact that it blocks [[Memory rehearsal|rehearsal]], which is used to better recall items in [[short-term memory]]. Rehearsal is the concept of directing attention to material that was just learned. This way, it can lengthen the duration of one's short-term memory capacity. In order to accurately calculate the duration of short-term memory using the Brown–Peterson task, such a method must be blocked so as not to falsely increase an unaltered duration. There are two different types of rehearsal:

'''Maintenance rehearsal''': This method of rehearsal uses repetition of the items in memory. It is essentially "saying something repeatedly in order to keep it in mind".&lt;ref name=Revlin /&gt; An example could be attempting to memorize a shopping list while out shopping for groceries. Instead of remembering to take the list out to the store, the shopper could leave it at home and proceed to repeat each word. As useful as this type of rehearsal may seem, it does not guarantee the ability to recall what was memorized after it is no longer rehearsed

'''Elaborative rehearsal''': This is type of rehearsal is also known as creative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal uses creativity to increase capacity of short-term memory and accurately recall items. Creating associations and connections between something significant to the person memorizing and the item(s) to be memorized is one example of elaborative rehearsal. Another example is the use of mnemonic devices, which are a creative way to mentally arrange the items to be memorized.

Three key words in rehearsal are Association, Location, and Imagination. Association is an important factor in rehearsal, as it is the part of elaborative rehearsal where people make connections with the items and things significant to them. This helps increase capacity of short-term memory as they are recalling items with the help of something meaningful to them. Location is another factor, as incorporating location into what they are trying to memorize may be another association to a significant location in particular, thus making the item much easier to recall. Finally, imagination is essentially the creativity of elaborative rehearsal. It combines creativity with the items to recall in such a way that makes them easiest to recall.

[[Cicero]]'s '''''Brutus''''' (also known as ''De claris oratibus'') is a history of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Eloquence|oratory]].  It is written in the form of a dialogue, in which [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] ask Cicero to describe the qualities of all the leading Roman orators up to their time. Cicero then attempts to propose a reconstruction of Roman history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brill's Companion to Cicero|last=May|first=James|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=9004121471|location=Netherlands|pages=401–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is written in the form of a dialogue, the majority of the talking is done by Cicero with occasional intervention by Brutus and Atticus. The work was probably composed in 46 BC, with the purpose of defending Cicero's own oratory. He begins with an introductory section on Greek oratory of the Attic, Asianic, and Rhodian schools, before discussing Roman orators, beginning with [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], "The Liberator", though becoming more specific from the time of [[Marcus Cornelius Cethegus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howatson|first1=M.C|last2=Chivers|first2=Ian|title=Oxford Concise Companion to Classical Literature|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192827081|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
'''''Cicero''''' -  He is the main figure of the work. He strengthens the idea that after the civil war, many of the "good" orators have either left or fled Rome. The few individuals who stayed behind are hiding in silence. Cicero recalls his visits to the forum and some of the orators he has been able to hear. He also mentions his study of eloquence and his dedication to philosophical studies.

'''''Brutus''''' ''-'' He is a friend of Atticus and a person who does not like eloquence.

'''''Atticus''''' - He is a friend of Brutus who encounters Cicero while walking somewhere. Cicero mentions that Atticus is from Athens when he discusses the beginnings of oratory. It should also be noted that Atticus speaks the least of all the three men.

== History of Eloquence ==
Cicero begins his work by lamenting the death of his friend [[Quintus Hortensius|Hortensius]] and then ponders on whether anyone should feel sad that his friend died. His dialogue then proceeds to the moment where he comes across Brutus and Atticus. They begin to discuss a letter that reveals that the Roman state has suffered numerous losses and that Rome is going through tumultuous times. Cicero proceeds and states that he wants to write a universal history of Roman oratory. Because of the fatal overthrow of the state, Cicero deems it necessary to write this '''history of eloquence'''. Cicero begins by stating that [[eloquence]] is a difficult thing to acquire and that it was first present in Atticus' hometown: [[Athens]]. Oratory does not appear in the infancy of Athens, but is evident in the maturity of her power. He traces oratory from figures such as [[Peisistratos]], [[Solon]], [[Pericles]], and mentions how figures like [[Socrates]] challenged them. He continues by saying that oratory was only limited to Athens and was not ubiquitous in Greece. It was from here that oratory spread through parts of Asia and the world.

Cicero then begins to trace the origins of oratory in [[Rome]]. He mentions figures like [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Curius,]] [[Marcus Popillius Laenas|M. Popilius]], [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Quinius Metellus]] and even discusses how [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] and [[Lysias]] the Athenian resemble each other in their elegance, character, and brevity. Cicero mentions the idea that Cato is overshadowed by other figures, but is still noteworthy. After Cato, a whole new bunch of orators appeared in Rome like Severius Galba. He also provides an example of how Galba was able to win over the court with an amazing, eloquent speech and that his people (in a court case) were freed from all charges.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cicero's Brutus or History of Famous Orators|last=Jones|first=E.|publisher=AMS Press New York|year=|isbn=0-404-54106-2|location=|pages=1–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the ''Brutus'' ==
Cicero's work is typically seen as a list of orators and the development of oratory in Rome. While the purpose of the Brutus is to record the history of oratory and confirm that it has failed to exist, some scholars believe that Cicero fails in adequately achieving his task. This is a problem because Cicero fails to include a reliable list of Roman oratory by purposely omitting figures like [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Catiline]], and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steel|first=C.E.W.|date=2002–2003|title=Cicero's Brutus: The End of Oratory and the Beginning of History?|jstor=43646670|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|volume=46|pages=195–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also argue that the ''Brutus'' is not a complete list because Cicero fails to include himself in his list.

Another interesting criticism of the Brutus is that it lacks minuscule scene details. The work only thoroughly describes the garden and the statue of Plato where the three men plan to discuss oratory, but other than that, the work is devoid of other details. Whereas the scenery lacks details, the conversation does not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Center for Security Studies''' ('''CSS''') is a  center at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]], which focuses on Swiss and international security.&lt;ref name=AboutUs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center.html |title=About Us |website= css.ethz.ch| publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCENetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osce-network.net/members/institutions/center-for-security-studies-css-eth-zuerich/ |title=OSCE Network |website=osce-network.net| publisher= OSCE Network, OSCE Network of Think Tanks and Academic Institutions |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The center was founded by Prof. Dr. Kurt Spillmann in 1986 and has been led by Prof. Dr. Andreas Wenger since 2002. It also constitutes as part of the [[Center for Comparative and International Studies]] (CIS) along with the political science professorships at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref name=AboutUs /&gt;

The mission of the CSS is to examine the challenges surrounding security policy development and how to deal with them. It does this by performing research on security-related issues and by training researchers and practitioners. The center also includes an independent think tank, which focuses on Swiss and international security policy as well as furthering peace. Another key aim of the CSS is to serve as a link between academia, practitioners and the public on security matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/center/mission-statement.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) |website= css.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Projects which have been supported by the CSS include the [[Parallel History Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/about/imprint/index.html |title=Imprint − Parallel History Project |website= ethz.ch |date= | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)| accessdate= 2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online project which collected together and analyzed declassified and other government documents relating to the [[Cold War]], as well as the [[International Relations and Security Network]], an online information service that provided a range of open access products and resources on [[international relations]]. While the International Relations and Security Network was closed in 2016, its extensive [[digital library]] as well as other products have been integrated into the CSS and transformed into a new project, CSS Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services.html |title=Resources | publisher= Center for Security Studies, Dept. of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich)|website= css.ethz.ch |date= 2016-10-10 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E. F. |last2=da Silva |first2=L. |last3=Porto de Mello |first3=G. F. |last4=Arany-Prado |first4=L. I. |title=The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eunucleocosmochronology. III. Extended sample  |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |date=2005 |volume=440 |issue=3 |pages=1153–1159 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053307 |bibcode= 2005A&amp;A...440.1153D | arxiv=astro-ph/0506458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|solar system]] formed at about 9.2 billion years (4.6 bn years ago), with the earliest traces of [[timeline of the evolutionary history of life|life]] on Earth emerging by about 10.3 billion years (3.5 bn years ago).

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark Ages ===

{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest structures and stars emerge===
:''Around 150 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang''
{{See also|Stellar formation|Dwarf galaxy| Baryon acoustic oscillations|Observable universe#Large-scale structure|Structure formation|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Stelliferous era}}
[[File:Hubble ultra deep field.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]s often showcase galaxies from an ancient era that tell us what the early Stelliferous Age was like]]
[[File:Hubble - infant galaxy.jpg|thumb|245px|Another Hubble image shows an infant galaxy forming nearby, which means this happened very recently on the cosmological timescale. This shows that new galaxy formation in the universe is still occurring.]]

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.
| In the case of indefinitely continuing [[metric expansion of space]], the energy density in the universe will decrease until, after an estimated time of  10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; years, it reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and no more structure will be possible. This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons. Some positrons and electrons will then recombine into photons.&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IV,&amp;nbsp;§VF.&lt;/sup&gt; In this case, the universe has reached a high-[[entropy]] state consisting of a bath of particles and low-energy radiation. It is not known however whether it eventually achieves [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=dying /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§VIB,&amp;nbsp;VID.&lt;/sup&gt; The hypothesis of a universal heat death stems from the 1850s ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] ([[Lord Kelvin]])&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1851). "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam." Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', March, 1851; and ''Philosophical Magazine'' IV. 1852, [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt; who extrapolated the theory of heat views of mechanical energy loss in nature, as embodied in the first two laws of thermodynamics, to universal operation.
|-
| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17053">In cultural and social studies, configurations are patterns of [[behaviour]], movement (→[[movement culture]]) and [[thinking]], which research observes when analysing different [[cultures]] and/ or historical changes. The term “configurations” is mostly used by comparative [[anthropological]] studies and by [[cultural history]]. '''Configurational analysis''' became a special method by the Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] during the 1970s and later by [[body culture studies]] in Denmark.
	
'''Configurational analysis''' is marked by its distance towards the [[history of ideas]] and [[intention]]s, which are conceived as mainstreams in historical studies. Configurations of human behaviour and movement have attracted special attention in the framework of phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) and particularly in [[materialist]] phenomenology.

== Configurations in earlier cultural studies ==

Configurations in different cultures were studied since early twentieth century.

[[Ruth Benedict]] (1934) contributed to the anthropology of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] by using the term of “configurations” as a translation of German “[[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]] [[:de:Gestalt]]”. Configuration denoted a whole of social attitudes, practices and beliefs and was nearly identical with “[[culture]]”. It was used for comparison – between the [[Hopi]] Indians and the Indians of the prairies, between Japanese and Western culture – and in a perspective of [[cultural relativism]]: Each culture has configurations of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth 1934: ''Patterns of Culture.'' Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) used the term ”diagram” to describe an order of conceived reality both in scientific and in literary understanding. This was his key to a "materialist [[psychoanalysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston 1938: ''La psychanalyse du feu;'' English 1964: ''Psychoanalysis of fire.'' Boston: Beacon&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelard’s approach became later a source of inspiration for [[Michel Foucault]].

[[Norbert Elias]] (1939, 1970) described certain patterns of relations between human beings as ''figuration [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/figuration]'' – in English: ”configuration” – becoming visible in play of cards, dance and football. He described these configurations as ''das sich wandelnde Muster, das die Spieler miteinander bilden'' (the changing pattern, which players form with each other), ''Spannungsgefüge'' (relations of suspense), ''Interdependenz der Spieler'' (interdependence of players), and ''das fluktuierende Spannungsgleichgewicht, das Hin und Her einer Machtbalance'' (the fluctuating balance of suspense, the to-and-fro of a balance of power).&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert 1939: ''Über den Prozess der Zivilisation. Soziogenetische und psychogenetische Untersuchungen.'' Frankfort/ Main Suhrkamp; English 1982: ''The Civilizing Process.'' Oxford Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This became a key to his sociology of [[civilization]].

[[Michel Foucault]] (1966) used the term ''la configuration'' in historical studies of philosophy, in order to characterize “the order of the things”, patterns of knowledge changing in [[epistemological]] disruptions. The configurations of savoir changed, according to Foucault, in following historical steps:&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel 1966: ''Les mots et les choses.'' Paris: Gallimard; English 1970: ''The Order of Things. An Archeology of the Human Sciences.'' New York: Pantheon&lt;/ref&gt;

: The age of [[Renaissance]] focused on the chains of similarities, going from sign to sign. [[Cervantes]] shaped an ironical picture of this configuration by the phantasmas of [[Don Quixote]].

: The 18th century constructed the tableau as an universal grammar. On this base, [[Linné]] constructed the genealogical trees of plants and animals as a tableau of life. An ironical picture of this configuration was given by [[Laurence Sterne]] in his [[Tristram Shandy]].

: The 19th century discovered [[progress (history)|progress]] and [[evolution]] – in [[life science]] as [[natural history]], in economy as [[Manufacturing|production]], and in language as [[linguistic history]]. On the background of these modern configurations, which took their form around 1800, individual [[subjectivity]] was constructed, as well as the dynamic of industrial life developed.

There are indicators that these configurations may disappear or transform again in a [[post-modern]] age.

== Configurations in historical behaviour studies ==

Configurational analysis (in German ''Konfigurationsanalyse'') became a particular methodological approach in the framework of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]], as they were developed at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970s by the historians August Nitschke and [[Henning Eichberg]]. Nitschke analyzed ''raum-zeitliche Muster'' (patterns of space and time) and ''Körperanordnungen'' (orders of the body) as “configurations” when comparing patterns of [[art]] and patterns of [[social behavior]]. Configurations were similarities, analogies and changing patterns of figures in a given space.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog; id. 1975 (ed.): ''Verhaltenswandel in der industriellen Revolution.'' Stuttgart: Kohlhammer&lt;/ref&gt;

This analytical approach was comparable to concepts, which in recent time have challenged historiography: [[mentality]] ([[Georges Duby]]), affect control ([[Norbert Elias]]) (→[[Affect control theory]]), perception ([[Lucien Febvre]]), structural thinking ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]), needs ([[David McClelland]]), and interaction ([[George Herbert Mead]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1981: ''Historische Verhaltensforschung.'' Stuttgart: Ulmer&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurational approach contrasted deliberately with the mainstream of [[historiography]] explaining history by the aims of its actors ([[pragmatism]]), as an expression of [[weltanschauung]] ([[psychology]] and [[history of ideas]]) or by interests (in [[social history]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad-Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog&lt;/ref&gt;

The configurational analysis was especially applied to [[comparative]] and historical studies of [[sport]] and [[dance]] as indicators of [[social change]]. The [[comparative]] analysis of [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], [[ball games]], [[equestrianism]], [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], and [[dance]] showed some common configurations as: the functional parceling of space, a new dynamic of “progress” and speed, the modern taste of [[suspense]], the principle of [[competition]], and the production of result tables. The configurations of [[movement culture]] prefigured the patterns of [[productivity]] orientation, which characterized the [[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Eichberg, Henning 1978: ''Leistung, Spannung Geschwindigkeit. Sport und Tanz im gesellschaftlichen Wandel des 18./19. Jahrhunderts.'' Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta&lt;/ref&gt;

The applied concept of “configuration” was here different from "system" (→[[cultural system]]) (being more static and systematic, and related to the negative term of the non-systematic), from “style” (being more [[aesthetic]] and having undertones of taste, [[subjectivity]] and stylization), and from “[[structure]]” (having undertones of “the functional”, as a heritage from [[structural functionalism]] in sociology). In contrast to these terms, configuration denotes a more dynamic pattern in change.

Configurations as patterns of behaviour, movement and thinking reflect man's perception of [[reality]]. They give an epochal pattern of [[perception]] which concurrently defines a framework for action.  But in no way they describe the whole reality of an epoch. Furthermore, their power to explain individual actions is limited. The epochal "reality" is no straitjacket which does not allow freedom of action. Nevertheless, in each epoch there are typical ways to act or to behave, to move or to think. They correspond with the way people perceive reality. Acting or thinking in this way may be right or wrong – it is typical anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August (1962): ''Heilige in dieser Welt. Persönliche Autorität und politische Wirksamkeit''. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer; Kalckhoff, Andreas (1982): "Historische Verhaltensforschung: Ethnologie unserer Vergangenheit. Die Konfiguration eines Aufstandes im 10. Jahrhundert", in Gehlen, Rolf &amp; Wolf, Bernd (eds.): ''Werner Müller zu seinem 75.Geburtstag, Unter dem Pflaster liegt der Strand 11''. Berlin: Karin Kramer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configurations in body culture studies ==

Studies of [[Human body|body]] culture, which spread in Denmark during the 1980s, developed the configurational analysis further, revealing inner tensions and contradictions of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Knut 2001 (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences; Eichberg, Henning 1998: ''Body Cultures.'' London: Routledge; id. - 2001: “Thinking contradictions. Towards a methodology of configurational analysis, or: How to reconstruct the societal signification of movement culture and sport.” In: Knut Dietrich (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences, 10-32; id. 2010: ''Bodily Democracy.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurative approach was applied to the analysis and especially to comparison of different fields of activities: popular [[festivity]], [[fitness culture]] (→[[physical fitness]]), sportive and non-sportive [[ball games]], sport [[racing]] and [[parcour]], different [[outdoor activities]], and different [[health]] cultures. Configurational analysis focused on bodily movement in time and space, on the energy of movement, on interpersonal relations, and on the objectification of movement. Above this basis, analysis included the superstructure of [[institutions]] and [[idea]]s (→[[Base and superstructure]]), which organize and reflect collective actions and interests.

: ''Time of bodily movement'' is marked, among others, by contradictions between acceleration and slowness – between living rhythm and mechanical pace – between linear-abstract and irreversible time – between cyclical, progressing and situational time. Historical change saw for instance the transformation from the noble [[exercises]] of the eighteenth century with their circulating and formally measured patterns to modern [[gymnastics]] and [[sports]] with their patterns of speed, acceleration, and flow, which characterized industrial behaviour more generally.

: ''Space of bodily movement'' is characterized by contradictions between the straight line and the [[labyrinth]] – between connection and parcellation of spaces – between geometrical and directed space – between space, place and intermediary space. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]’s study of the [[panopticon]] as a specific modern way of organising the space of movement and bodily visibility around 1800 showed the societal depth of this analysis.

: ''Energy of bodily movement'' consists of a multiplicity of different atmospheres, radiations, moods and modes of attunement. Modern suspension ([[suspense]], tension, thrill, excitement – in German ''Spannung''') emerged in eighteenth and nineteenth century’s [[boxing]] and [[ball games]] at the same time as it appeared in [[detective novels]]. This coincidence was illustrative for the configurational change towards [[industrial society]]. Social energy was also illustrated by the study of [[laughter]] in the tradition of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]’s analysis of [[Renaissance]] society.

: ''[[Interpersonal relations]]'' in bodily movement tell about power and [[gender]] – about winners and losers – about you- and we-relations in motion. The study of sports has especially been enriched by the attention to gender unbalances in body culture.

: ''[[Objectification]] of bodily movement'' is especially characteristic for modern body cultures. Bodily movement is reified in a tension between process and result – between [[social production]], reproduction and a-productive encounters in bodily activity – between producing data or pictures by movement. The production of records by modern sports has been a central point for understanding modern industrial behaviour.

: Above these basic body-cultural processes, body culture shows patterns of organizational and institutional character as well as the meanings and ideas, which are ascribed to bodily practices. Mainstream studies of sport often over-emphasize these ''superstructures'' (→[[Base and superstructure]]), while the configurational analysis of body culture gives priority to the focus on bodily practice, in the framework of a [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

== Further configurational approaches ==

Configurational analysis can be compared with other contemporary approaches in cultural and social studies.

: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1966/67, 1979) launched the concept of ”[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]” to describe patterns of action, of bodily practice and presentation, of taste and aesthetic form (comparable to the [[Gothic style]] of Medieval  cathedrals).

In [[physical cosmology]], '''cosmological perturbation theory''' is the theory by which the ''evolution of structure'' is understood in the [[big bang]] model. It uses [[general relativity]] to compute the gravitational forces causing small perturbations to grow and eventually seed the formation of [[star formation|star]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[galaxy formation|galaxies]] and [[cluster of galaxies|cluster]]s. It only applies to situations in which the universe is predominantly homogeneous, such as during [[cosmic inflation]] and large parts of the big bang. The universe is believed to still be homogeneous enough that the theory is a good approximation on the largest scales, but on smaller scales more involved techniques, such as [[N-body simulation]]s, must be used.

Because of the [[gauge invariance]] of [[general relativity]], the correct formulation of cosmological perturbation theory is subtle. There are currently two distinct approaches to perturbation theory in classical general relativity:

* ''gauge-invariant perturbation theory'' based on foliating a space-time with hyper-surfaces, and
* ''1+3 covariant gauge-invariant perturbation theory'' based on threading a space-time with frames.

== Gauge-invariant perturbation theory ==

The gauge-invariant perturbation theory is based on developments by Bardeen (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Bardeen J (1980) Phys. Rev. D, 22, 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Kodama and Sasaki (1984)&lt;ref&gt;Kodama H,  Sasaki M, (1984) Prog. Theor. Phys. Supplement, 78, 1-166
&lt;/ref&gt;  building on the work of Lifshitz (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Lifshitz E M (1946) J. Phys. (USSR), 10, 116&lt;/ref&gt; This is the standard approach to perturbation theory of general relativity for cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V. F., and Feldman, H. A., and Brandenberger, R. H.: "Theory of Cosmological Perturbations", Physics Reports (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is widely used for the computation of anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref name = "Husugi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu W, Sugiyama N | title = Toward Understanding CMB Anisotropies and Their Implications | journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 51 | year = 1995 | arxiv = astro-ph/9411008 | pages = 2599 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.51.2599 |bibcode = 1995PhRvD..51.2599H | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[physical cosmology]] program and focuses on predictions arising from linearisations that preserve gauge invariance with respect to Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models. This approach draws heavily on the use of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian]] like analogue and usually has as it starting point the FRW background around which perturbations are developed. The approach is '''non-local and coordinate dependent but gauge invariant''' as the resulting linear framework is built from a specified family of background hyper-surfaces which are linked by gauge preserving mappings to foliate the space-time. Although intuitive this approach does not deal well with the nonlinearities natural to general relativity.

== 1+3 covariant gauge-invariant perturbation theory ==

In [[relativistic cosmology]] using the Lagrangian threading dynamics of Ehlers (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers J (1971) General Relativity and Cosmology (Varenna), R K Sachs (Academic Press NY)&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellis (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Ellis G F R, (1971) General Relativity and Cosmology(Varenna), R K Sachs (Academic Press NY)&lt;/ref&gt; it is usual to use the gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory developed by Hawking (1966)&lt;ref&gt;Hawking S W (1966) ApJ. 145, 44&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellis and Bruni (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Ellis G F R, Bruni M (1989) Phys. Rev. D, 40, 6, 1804&lt;/ref&gt; Here rather than starting with a background and perturbing away from that background one starts with full [[general relativity]] and systematically reduces the theory down to one that is linear around a particular background.&lt;ref&gt;Tsagas C G, Challinor A, Maartens R (2008) Physics Reports 465  61-147&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is '''local and both covariant as well as gauge invariant''' but can be non-linear because the approach is built around the local [[comoving observer]] frame (see [[frame bundle]]) which is used to thread the entire space-time. This approach to perturbation theory produces differential equations that are of just the right order needed to describe the true physical degrees of freedom and as such no non-physical gauge modes exist. It is usual to express the theory in a coordinate free manner. For applications of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], because one is required to use the full [[tangent bundle]], it becomes convenient to use the [[Tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]] formulation of relativistic cosmology. The application of this approach to the computation of anisotropies in [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref name="maartens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Maartens R, Gebbie T, Ellis GF| title = Cosmic microwave background anisotropies: Nonlinear dynamics| journal = Phys. Rev.

Mod. Phys., 52, 299&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellis, Matravers and Treciokas (1983).&lt;ref&gt;Ellis G F R, Treciokas R, Matravers D R, (1983) Ann. Phys., 150, 487&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gauge freedom and frame fixing ==

In relativistic cosmology there is a freedom associated with the choice of threading frame, this frame choice is distinct from choice associated with coordinates. Picking this frame is equivalent to fixing the choice of timelike world lines mapped into each other, this reduces the [[gauge freedom]] it does not fix the gauge but the theory remains gauge invariant under the remaining gauge freedoms. In order to fix the gauge a specification of correspondences between the time surfaces in the real universe (perturbed) and the background universe are required along with the correspondences between points on the initial spacelike surfaces in the background and in the real universe. This is the link between the gauge-invariant perturbation theory and the gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is only guaranteed if the choice of frame coincides exactly with that of the background; usually this is trivial to ensure because physical frames have this property.

== Newtonian-like equations ==

Newtonian-like equations emerge from perturbative general relativity with the choice of the [[Newtonian gauge]]; the Newtonian gauge provides the direct link between the variables typically used in the gauge-invariant perturbation theory and those arising from the more general gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory.

'''Cross-boundary subsidies''' are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat [[landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] boundaries, subsidizing the resident [[populations]]. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect [[community]] and [[food web]] structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.

==Introduction and development of the concept==
The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of [[landscape ecology]] and [[food web]] ecology. The ideas from landscape ecology allow the study of population, community, and food web dynamics to incorporate spatial relationships between landscape elements into an understanding of such dynamics (Polis et al. 1997).

Janzen (1986) first defined cross-boundary subsidies as a process whereby organisms that disperse from one patch into another impact resident organisms by providing increased food resources or opportunities for reproduction, thus serving as a subsidy to the residents. By this definition, only the cross-boundary movement of organisms is considered, but broader definitions of cross-boundary subsidies can also include materials such as nutrients and [[detritus]] (i.e. Marburg et al. 2006, Facelli and Pickett 1991).

Cross-boundary subsidies are a subset of the more general process of spatial subsidies (see Polis et al. 1997). Cross-boundary subsidies acknowledge the presence and role of the boundary between different habitat patches in mediating flows of organisms and materials. In contrast, spatial subsidies require only that external inputs of materials and organisms originate from outside the patch of interest.

===Conceptual models===
Few attempts have been made to combine landscape and [[food web]] ecology in such a way that explicitly recognizes the importance of cross-boundary subsidies and spatial features of the landscape on food web dynamics. Often, spatial subsidies are treated as subsidies that simply arrive from outside the patch of interest, not addressing the landscape patterns and processes that may affect the movement of these inputs, such as boundary characteristics and patch connectivity. Polis et al. (1997) published a thorough review of spatially subsidized food web dynamics, focusing on the effect of subsidies on population, [[community]], consumer-resource, and food web dynamics. One of the main conclusions was that subsidies of consumer species (organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy) resulted in declines of food resources in the recipient patch. Callaway and Hastings (2002) built off Polis et al.’s conclusion with a model to show that subsidized consumers may not always drive down the resource in the recipient patch if consumers move between patches frequently. This might occur because consumers often move for reasons other than food resource acquisition.

Cadenasso et al. (2003) developed a framework for studying ecological boundaries, which has implications for understanding the dynamics of specific cross-boundary subsidies. The boundary is defined as the zone of the steepest gradient of change in some characteristic from one patch to another, such as rapidly decreasing light levels as habitat transitions from a field to a forest. In this framework, flows across variable landscapes are characterized by the type of flow (materials, energy, organisms, etc.), patch contrast (architecture, composition, process), and boundary structure (architecture, composition, symbolic and perceptual features). Considering a cross-boundary subsidy in terms of this framework shows how the boundary itself can mediate the subsidy. For example, Cadenasso and Pickett (2001) found that the decreased lateral vegetation at the boundary between a forest and field increased the amount of seeds transferred into the forest interior.

Another conceptual model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies is a model developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by predatory insects. The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch [[productivity]], and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by predatory insects (Fig. 1).

[[Image:Rand2006 adapted.JPG|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual model of cross-boundary subsidies of insect predators from agricultural to adjacent wildland patches. '''a.''' Habitat specialization, the boundary is a hard edge to predators such that they do not disperse to the wildland patch. '''b.''' Differences in [[productivity]], increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This is an example of a directional positive edge response. '''c.''' Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches. This is an example of a reciprocal positive edge response.

==Relation to selected ecological concepts==

===Landscape ecology===
A spatial subsidy, in the context of landscape ecology, is a doner-mediated resource (nutrient, detritus, prey) which is passed from one habitat to a recipient (consumer) in a second habitat. As a result, the productivity of the recipient is increased (Polis et al., 1997). For example, a bear eats a salmon and acquires the resources that have passed through the marine environment across the habitat boundary and into a terrestrial environment.

===Source sink dynamics===
The idea of a subsidy of materials or organisms across a patch boundary affecting resident populations has clear parallels with [[source-sink dynamics]] (Fagan et al. 1999). In this theory, local populations are connected by dispersal, and the extinction of local populations can be prevented through immigration from neighboring patches (Pulliam 1988). In source-sink dynamics, it is assumed that individuals from more productive patches will move to less productive patches with unsustainable populations (Pulliam 1988). Many examples of cross-boundary subsidies can be thought of as exhibiting source-sink dynamics. Rand et al. (2006) found that insects in a high productivity agricultural patch were able to sustain local populations in a lower productivity wildland patch through continued dispersal from the agricultural patch. The effect of these subsidies to local patches can also impact populations of other species in the recipient [[food web]], because the subsidized population may compete with or prey upon other species more effectively than they would be able to without such an influx (Fagan et al. 1999).

===Biotic interactions and trophic structure===
Cross-boundary subsidies have important impacts on species interactions and food web dynamics. Subsidies of materials and organisms can affect all trophic, or feeding, levels of food webs either directly or indirectly. Inputs of nutrient and [[detritus]] from another patch generally increase the population growth of the resident producers (plants) and [[detritus|detritivores]] (Polis et al. 1997). Increased growth at the producer level can result in a bottom-up trophic effect, in which increases in [[populations]] at lower [[trophic level]]s support a higher population of consumers than would otherwise be possible in a closed system (Polis et al. 1997). [[allochthonous]] detrital inputs can also have strong impacts on food web dynamics over a variety of temporal scales, ranging from seconds to millennia, as in the case of [[fossil fuel]] formation from build-up of detritus over millennia (Moore et al. 2004).

====Coarse woody debris====
Many food webs rely on cross-boundary subsidies of detritus for sources of energy and nutrients (Huxel and McCann 1998). For example, a series of lakes in Wisconsin were examined for the presence of [[Coarse woody debris]] (CWD) and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape that might control its input to lakes. Coarse woody debris in these lakes is important for providing habitat and food resources for a variety of organisms including small fish (Werner and Hall 1988), algae, and detritivores (Bowen et al. 1998). Marburg et al. (2006) compared variation within and among lakes in CWD. They found that subsidies of CWD to lakes were lower when the lakes had human development along the shore. Development along the lakeshore can be thought of as an alteration to the characteristics of the patch boundary between the lake and forest. In this case, development decreased both forest density that is the source of CWD and also the permeability of the boundary to flows of CWD (Marburg et al. 2006).

====Predator-prey====
In addition to bottom-up effects, top-down effects may also occur due to cross-boundary subsidies. In top-down effects, subsidies of consumers at the top level of the food web control populations at lower levels more so than would be expected by only the action of resident consumers (Polis et al. 1997). Consumers that cross boundaries may have a greater effect on the recipient patch population if prey in the recipient patch have a lower population growth rate than prey in the source patch (Fagan et al. 1999, Rand et al. 2006). Thus, cross-boundary subsidies may alter predator-prey/competitive interactions that can result in a disproportionate impact on the communities of the recipient patch.

====Trophic cascade====
In subsidizing top trophic levels, effects may also be felt at all lower trophic levels in a phenomenon known as a [[trophic cascade]]. An example of a trophic cascade that also acted as a cross-boundary subsidy is illustrated in a study by Knight et al. (2005) in which changes in the trophic structure of one ecosystem resulted in an effect that cascaded to the adjacent ecosystem. In ponds containing fish, dragonfly larvae were kept to a minimum by fish predation. The resulting low density of adult dragonfly predators led to a high density of bee pollinators. With fish present in adjacent ponds, bees were able to pollinate more flowers in the adjacent upland ecosystem than they were when fish were absent. The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation. That subsidy was then transferred across the pond-upland boundary by adult dragonfly movement to affect the interaction between bee pollinators and plants.

===Subsidy cascade===
Native species that forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

==Human activities affecting cross-boundary subsidies==

===Agriculture ===
Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. For example, Luskin et al (2017) used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illustrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on natural habitats located &gt;1.3 km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

===Fragmentation===
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented due to human activity, the influence of patch boundaries on individual patches becomes relatively more important (Murcia 1995). [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] can both cut off necessary subsidies to patches and increase the magnitude of subsidies from adjacent patches. For example, in a study of fragmentation of wildlands in an agriculturally dominated landscape, subsidies of habitat specialist insects to wildland patches were prevented by surrounding small, wildland patches with inhospitable agricultural land. This isolation reduced the potential for [[gene flow]] and long-term persistence of the population. Subsidies of other insects that specialized on agricultural crops were increased to wildland [[populations]], increasing their effect on the resident wildland species (Duelli 1990).

===Alteration of patch and boundary characteristics===
Changing the internal structure and composition of a patch may substantially alter cross-boundary subsidies. [[Logging]] may temporarily increase subsidies of nutrients and detritus to adjacent streams (Likens et al. 1970). [[Invasive species]] introduced to agricultural patches may act as a subsidy to adjacent wildland invasive populations, preventing native species establishment, even within the protected area (Janzen 1983).

====Marine systems====
Human alterations of patch characteristics may also curtail cross-boundary subsidies such as [[overfishing]] in marine systems, which may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies of organisms to freshwater and riparian systems (Zhang et al. 2003). For example, Helfield and Naiman (2002) found that riparian trees in [[Alaska]] obtain 24-26% of their nitrogen from marine sources, transferred from migrating [[salmon]]. In this system, [[salmon]] that feed in the ocean, incorporating marine nitrogen into their biomass, later return to their natal small streams where they spawn and die. [[Salmon]] carcasses transferred across the stream-riparian zone boundary by terrestrial predators or flooding events subsidized growth of terrestrial plants. Thus, marine overfishing may affect the productivity of Alaskan forests that depend on subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen.

As discussed above, cross-boundary subsidies depend on the characteristics of the patch boundary. Human-induced changes in these characteristics can affect boundary permeability to certain organisms or materials. For example, a cross-boundary subsidy of leaf litter from forest to an adjacent open field may be attenuated at the boundary if a road is present, making the boundary less permeable to flows of leaf litter (Facelli and Pickett 1991).

==Implications for management and future research needs==
Habitat management might benefit from recognizing the effect that humans may have on both individual patches and on the dynamics between patches. In such cases, managers may need to focus on patterns and processes that occur outside of their patch of interest, as these factors may also be important to internal [[population dynamics]]. An understanding of boundary features that influence the various flows of interest is necessary in managing for those flows.

=== Invasive species ===
The implications of [[invasive species]] and the use of [[biological control]] agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. Introducing species into one patch for [[biocontrol]] may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.

Other fields, such as public policy, can also benefit from considering cross-boundary subsidies. For example, governments often provide [[subsidy|financial subsidies]] to [[fisheries]], which have a negative effect on those ecosystems by encouraging overfishing (Munro and Sumaila 2002). Understanding what processes affect how those financial resources flow across that particular government-industry boundary is important to the maintenance of marine [[food web]]s. Considering cross-boundary effects will be essential to a complete understanding of potential consequences of human action on the landscape.

'''DOPIPE''' [[Parallelism (computing)|parallelism]] is a method to perform [[Data parallelism|loop-level parallelism]] by pipelining the statements in a loop. [[Pipeline (computing)|Pipelined]] parallelism may exist at different levels of abstraction like loops, functions and algorithmic stages. The extent of [[Parallelism (computing)|parallelism]] depends upon the programmers' ability to make best use of this concept. It also depends upon factors like identifying and separating the independent tasks and executing them parallelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Multicore Software Development|last=Pankratius|first=Victor|last2=Adl-Tabatabai|first2=Ali-Reza|last3=Tichy|first3=Walter|publisher=CRC press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The main purpose of employing [[Data parallelism|loop-level parallelism]] is to search and split sequential tasks of a program and convert them into parallel tasks without any prior information about the [[algorithm]]. Parts of data that are recurring and consume significant amount of execution time are good candidates for [[Data parallelism|loop-level parallelism]]. Some common applications of [[Data parallelism|loop-level parallelism]] are found in mathematical analysis that uses multiple-dimension matrices which are iterated in nested loops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different kind of parallelization techniques which are used on the basis of data storage overhead, degree of parallelization and [[data dependencies]]. Some of the known techniques are: '''[[Data parallelism|DOALL]]''', '''[[Data parallelism|DOACROSS]]''' and '''DOPIPE'''.

'''DOALL:''' This technique is used where we can parallelize each iteration of the loop without any interaction between the iterations. Hence, the overall run-time gets reduced from N * T (for a serial processor, where T is the execution time for each iteration) to only T (since all the N iterations are executed in parallel).

'''DOACROSS:''' This technique is used wherever there is a possibility for data dependencies. Hence, we parallelize tasks in such a manner that all the data independent tasks are executed in parallel, but the dependent ones are executed sequentially. There is a degree of synchronization used to sync the dependent tasks across parallel processors.

== Description ==
DOPIPE is a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]] parallelization technique that is used in programs where each element produced during each iteration is consumed in the later iteration. The following example shows how to implement the DOPIPE technique to reduce the total execution time by breaking the tasks inside the loop and executing them in a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]] manner. The breaking into tasks takes place in such a way that all the [[Data dependencies|dependencies]] within the loop are unidirectional, i.e. the following iteration does not depend on the previous iteration.

=== Example ===
The program below shows a [[pseudocode]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; for DOPIPE parallelization.

In this code, we see that there are three tasks (F0, F1 and F2) inside a loop iterating over &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; for 1 to &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;. Following is a list of dependencies in the code:

F1[j] → &lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; F1[j+1], implies that statement F1 in iteration &lt;code&gt;j+1&lt;/code&gt; must be executed after statement F1 in iteration &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;. This is also known as true dependency.

F1[j] → &lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; F2[j], implies that statement F2 in iteration &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; must be executed after statement F1 in iteration &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;pre&gt;
for (j=1; j&lt;=N; j++) {
    F0: o[j] = x[j] - a[j];
    F1: z[j] = z[j-1] * 5;
    F2: y[j] = z[j] * w[j];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;If this code would have been executed sequentially, then the total time consumed would be equal to N * (T&lt;sub&gt;F0&lt;/sub&gt; + T&lt;sub&gt;F1&lt;/sub&gt; + T&lt;sub&gt;F2&lt;/sub&gt;), where T&lt;sub&gt;F0&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;F1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;F2&lt;/sub&gt; denote execution time for functions F0, F1 and F2 respectively per iteration.

Now, if we parallelize the loop by pipelining the statements inside the loop in the following manner:&lt;pre&gt;
for (j=1; j&lt;=N; j++) {
    F0: o[j] = x[j] - a[j];             //DOALL parallelism
}

for (j=1; j&lt;=N; j++) {
    F1: z[j] = z[j-1] * 5;              //DOPIPE parallelism
    post(j);                            //The result of F1 is posted and available for use
}

for (j=1; j&lt;=N; j++) {
    wait(j);                            //It waits till the F1 completes and produces the value z[j] to be used by F2
    F2: y[j] = z[j] * w[j];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;Since, F0 is an independent function, i.e. it does not have any loop-carried dependency (no dependence on &lt;code&gt;j+1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;j-1&lt;/code&gt; iterations). Neither it has any dependency across other statements in the loop. Hence, we can completely separate out this function and run it parallelly using DOALL [[Parallelism (computing)|parallelism]]. On the other hand, Statements F1 and F2 are dependent (explained above), therefore we split them into two different loops and execute them in a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]] fashion. We use &lt;code&gt;post(j)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wait(j)&lt;/code&gt; to synchronize between F1 and F2 loops.

Starting from the first iteration of &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, statement F1 gets executed in T&lt;sub&gt;F1&lt;/sub&gt; time. Meanwhile, F2 is not getting executed since it is waiting for the value &lt;code&gt;z[j]&lt;/code&gt; to be produced by F1. When F1 completes its execution for iteration &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, it posts the value using &lt;code&gt;post(j)&lt;/code&gt;. After waiting for F1's execution, using &lt;code&gt;wait(j)&lt;/code&gt;, F2 starts its execution since it has the value &lt;code&gt;z[j]&lt;/code&gt; available for use. Also, since F1's execution is not restricted by F2, hence F1 executes &lt;code&gt;j+1&lt;/code&gt; simultaneously. The figure below shows the execution timeline of all the statements.
[[File:Example for DOPIPE.png|thumb|562x562px|DOPIPE example]]
From the figure, we see that the total time to execute F0 is T&lt;sub&gt;F0&lt;/sub&gt;, since all the iterations of F0 are executed in parallel. While for F1 and F2, the total execution time is equal to N * T&lt;sub&gt;F1&lt;/sub&gt; + T&lt;sub&gt;F2&lt;/sub&gt; (considering negligible synchronization time).

This is considerably less than the time obtained during sequential execution.

== Comparison with other models ==
DOALL [[Parallelism (computing)|parallelism]] mainly works on principle of divide and conquer. Here all the tasks run in different iterations that use unique set of data. So the problem with this implementation is that when large amount of data works is computed together, a large [[Cache (computing)|cache]] space is needed to work for different [[Thread (computing)|threads]]. Since there is no [[Data dependencies|dependencies]] in the [[Thread (computing)|threads]], there is no overhead for the inter - thread communication.

While in DOPIPE, there is a synchronization overhead between the threads. But, due to its pipelined structure, it requires less cache space because the data produced is immediately consumed by the consumer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16129">'''Data-driven control systems''' are a broad family of [[Control theory|control systems]], in which the [[System identification|identification]] of the process model and/or the design of the controller are based entirely on ''experimental data'' collected from the plant &lt;ref&gt;Bazanella, A.S., Campestrini, L., Eckhard, D. (2012). Data-driven controller design: the &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; approach. Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-007-2300-9}}, 208 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In many control applications, trying to write a mathematical model of the plant is considered a hard task, requiring efforts and time to the process and control engineers. This problem is overcome by ''data-driven'' methods, which allow to fit a system model to the experimental data collected, choosing it in a specific models class. The control engineer can then exploit this model to design a proper controller for the system. However, it is still difficult to find a simple yet reliable model for a physical system, that includes only those dynamics of the system that are of interest for the control specifications. The ''direct'' data-driven methods allow to tune a controller, belonging to a given class, without the need of an identified model of the system. In this way, one can also simply weight process dynamics of interest inside the control cost function, and exclude those dynamics that are out of interest.

== Overview ==

The ''standard'' approach to control systems design is organized in two-steps: 
# Model identification aims at estimating a nominal model of the system &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} = G\left(q; \widehat{\theta}_N\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the unit-delay operator (for discrete-time transfer functions representation) and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}_N&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of parameters of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; identified on a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; data. Then, validation consists in constructing the ''uncertainty set'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that contains the true system &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; at a certain probability level.
# Controller design aims at finding a controller &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; achieving closed-loop stability and meeting the required performance with &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Typical objectives of [[System Identification|system identification]] are to have &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and to have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; as small as possible. However, from an [[System identification#Identification for control|identification for control]] perspective, what really matters is the performance achieved by the controller, not the intrinsic quality of the model.

One way to deal with uncertainty is to design a controller that has an acceptable performance with all models in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is the main idea behind [[robust control]] design procedure, that aims at building frequency domain uncertainty descriptions of the process. However, being based on worst-case assumptions rather than on the idea of averaging out the noise, this approach typically leads to ''conservative'' uncertainty sets. Rather, data-driven techniques deal with uncertainty by working on experimental data, and avoiding excessive conservativism.

In the following, the main classifications of data-driven control systems are presented.

=== Indirect and direct methods ===
There are many methods available to control the systems. 
The fundamental distinction is between '''indirect''' and '''direct''' controller design methods. The former group of techniques is still retaining the standard two-step approach, ''i.e.'' first a model is identified, then a controller is tuned based on such model. The main issue in doing so is that the controller is computed from the estimated model &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the [[Stochastic control#Certainty equivalence|certainty equivalence]] principle), but in practice &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G} \neq G_0&lt;/math&gt;. To overcome this problem, the idea behind the latter group of techniques is to map the experimental data ''directly'' onto the controller, without any model to be identified in between.

=== Iterative and noniterative methods ===

Another important distinction is between '''iterative''' and '''noniterative''' (or '''one-shot''') methods. In the former group, repeated iterations are needed to estimate the controller parameters, during which the [[Optimization_problem|optimization problem]] is performed based on the results of the previous iteration, and the estimation is expected to become more and more accurate at each iteration. This approach is also prone to on-line implementations (see below). In the latter group, the (optimal) controller parametrization is provided with a single optimization problem. This is particularly important for those systems in which iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed (for example, due to economic aspects). In such cases, one should select a design technique capable of delivering a controller on a single data set. This approach is often implemented off-line (see below).

=== On-line and off-line methods ===

Since, on practical industrial applications, open-loop or closed-loop data are often available continuously, '''on-line''' data-driven techniques use those data to improve the quality of the identified model and/or the performance of the controller each time new information is collected on the plant. Instead, '''off-line''' approaches work on batch of data, which may be collected only once, or multiple times at a regular (but rather long) interval of time.

== Iterative feedback tuning ==

The iterative feedback tuning (IFT) method was introduced in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;Hjalmarsson, H., Gevers, M., Gunnarsson, S., &amp; Lequin, O. (1998). Iterative feedback tuning: theory and applications. IEEE control systems, 18(4), 26–41.&lt;/ref&gt;, starting from the observation that, in identification for control, each iteration is based on the (wrong) certainty equivalence principle.

IFT is a model-free technique for the direct iterative optimization of the parameters of a fixed-order controller; such parameters can be successively updated using information coming from standard (closed-loop) system operation.

Let &lt;math&gt;y^d&lt;/math&gt; be a desired output to the reference signal &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the error between the achieved and desired response is &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\rho)=y(\rho)-y^d&lt;/math&gt;. The control design objective can be formulated as the minimization of the objective function:

:&lt;math&gt; J(\rho) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{t=1}^N E\left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Given the objective function to minimize, the ''quasi-Newton method'' can be applied, i.e. a gradient-based minimization using a gradient search of the type:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_{i+1} = \rho_i - \gamma_i R_i^{-1}  \frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}(\rho_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the step size, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate positive definite matrix and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\widehat{J}}{d\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of the gradient; the true value of the gradient is given by the following:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dJ}{d\rho} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left[\tilde{y}(t,\rho)\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta y}{\delta \rho}(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained through the following three-step methodology:

# Normal Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as reference; collect N measurements of the output &lt;math&gt;y(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(1)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Gradient Experiment: Perform an experiment on the closed loop system with &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; as controller and 0 as reference &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; inject the signal &lt;math&gt;r-y^{(1)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt; such that it is summed to the control variable output by &lt;math&gt;C(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, going as input into the plant. Collect the output, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y^{(2)} (\rho) &lt;/math&gt;.
# Take the following as gradient approximation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho) = \frac{\delta C}{\delta \rho} (\rho) y^{(2)} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

A crucial factor for the convergence speed of the algorithm is the choice of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;; when &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; is small, a good choice is the approximation given by the Gauss–Newton direction:

: &lt;math&gt; R_i = \frac 1 N \sum_{t=1}^N \frac{\delta \widehat{y}}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i) \frac{\delta \widehat{y}^T}{\delta \rho} (\rho_i).&lt;/math&gt;

== Noniterative correlation-based tuning ==

Noniterative correlation-based tuning (nCbT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller&lt;ref&gt;van Heusden, K., Karimi, A. and Bonvin, D. (2011), Data-driven model reference control with asymptotically guaranteed stability. Int. J. Adapt. Control Signal Process., 25: 331–351. doi:10.1002/acs.1212&lt;/ref&gt;. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unknown LTI stable SISO plant, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined reference model and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a user-defined weighting function. An LTI fixed-order controller is indicated as &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)=\beta^T \rho&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of LTI basis functions. Finally, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal LTI controller of any structure, guaranteeing a closed-loop function &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; when applied to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal is to minimize the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\rho)=\left\| F \bigg( \frac{ K^* G-K(\rho)G }{ (1+K^* G)^2 } \bigg) \right\|_2^2. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex approximation of the objective function obtained from a model reference problem, supposing that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ (1+K(\rho)G) } \approx \frac{1}{ (1+K^*G) }&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is stable and minimum-phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the scheme in figure.

[[File:Noniterative Correlation-based Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The idea is that, when ''G'' is stable and minimum phase, the approximated model reference problem is equivalent to the minimization of the norm of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The input signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be a persistently exciting input signal and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be generated by a stable data-generation mechanism. The two signals are thus uncorrelated in an open-loop experiment; hence, the ideal error &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The control objective thus consists in finding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t,\rho^* )&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated.

The vector of ''instrumental variables'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta(t)=[r_W (t+\ell_1 ),r_W (t+\ell_1-1),\ldots,r_W (t),\ldots,r_W (t-\ell_1) ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; is large enough and &lt;math&gt;r_W (t)=Wr(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate filter.

The correlation function is:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{N,\ell_1} (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \zeta(t) \varepsilon(t,\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

and the optimization problem becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho} = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} f_{N,\ell_1}^T f_{N,\ell_1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting with &lt;math&gt;\phi_r (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that, under some assumptions, if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is selected as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(e^{-j\omega}) = \frac{F(e^{-j\omega})(1-M(e^{-j\omega}))}{\phi_r (\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

then, the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N,\ell_1 \to \infty, \ell_1/N \to \infty} \widehat{\rho} = \rho^*.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability constraint ===

There is no guarantee that the controller &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J_{N,\ell_1}&lt;/math&gt; is stable. Instability may occur in the following cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-minimum phase, &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; may lead to cancellations in the right-half complex plane.
* If &lt;math&gt;K^*&lt;/math&gt; (even if stabilizing) is not achievable, &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be stabilizing.
* Due to measurement noise, even if &lt;math&gt;K^*=K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stabilizing, data-estimated &lt;math&gt;\widehat{K}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; may not be so.

Consider a stabilizing controller &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; and the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;M_s=\frac{K_s G}{1+K_s G}&lt;/math&gt;.
Define:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) := M_s - K(\rho) G (1-M_s) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\rho) := \left\| \Delta(\rho) \right\|_\infty. &lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem''' 
:''The controller &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the plant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if

# &lt;math&gt; \Delta(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is stable
# &lt;math&gt;\exist \delta_N \in (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt; \delta (\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;''

Condition 1. is enforced when:

* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is stable
* &lt;math&gt;K(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; contains an integrator (it is canceled).

The model reference design with stability constraint becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_s = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J(\rho) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \text{s.t. } \delta(\rho) \leq \delta_N. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''convex data-driven estimation''' of &lt;math&gt;\delta(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. 

Define the following:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \widehat{R}_r (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) r(t) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2 \\[4pt]
&amp; \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N r(t-\tau) \varepsilon(t,\rho) \text{ for } \tau = -\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For '''stable minimum phase plants''', the following '''convex data-driven oprimization problem''' is given:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\rho} &amp; = \underset{\rho \in D_k}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} J_{N,\ell_1}(\rho) \\[3pt]
&amp; \text{s.t.} \\[3pt]
&amp; \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_{r\varepsilon} (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \leq \delta_N \bigg| \sum_{\tau=-\ell_2}^{\ell_2} \widehat{R}_r (\tau,\rho) e^{-j\tau\omega_k} \bigg| \\[4pt]
\omega_k &amp; = \frac{2 \pi k}{2\ell_2+1}, \qquad k=0,\ldots,\ell_2+1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Virtual reference feedback tuning ==

Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a noniterative method for data-driven tuning of a fixed-structure controller. It provides a one-shot method to directly synthesize a controller based on a single dataset.

VRFT was first proposed &lt;ref&gt;Guardabassi, Guido O., and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Approximate feedback linearization of discrete-time non-linear systems using virtual input direct design." Systems &amp; Control Letters 32.2 (1997): 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; as &lt;math&gt;VRD^2&lt;/math&gt; and then fixed and extended  for LTI &lt;ref&gt;Campi, Marco C., Andrea Lecchini, and Sergio M. Savaresi. "Virtual reference feedback tuning: a direct method for the design of feedback controllers." Automatica 38.8 (2002): 1337–1346.&lt;/ref&gt; and LPV &lt;ref&gt;Formentin, S., Piga, D., Tóth, R., &amp; Savaresi, S. M. (2016). Direct learning of LPV controllers from data. Automatica, 65, 98–110.&lt;/ref&gt; systems.

The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)&lt;/math&gt; from the measured output signal &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning Scheme.svg|thumb|483x180px|The main idea is to define a desired closed loop model M and to use its inverse dynamics to obtain a virtual reference from the measured output signal y.]]

The virtual signals are &lt;math&gt;r_v (t)=M^{-1} y(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_v (t)=r_v (t) - y(t). &lt;/math&gt;

The optimal controller is obtained from noiseless data by solving the following optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}_\infty = \underset{\rho}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \lim_{N \to \infty} J_{vr} (\rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where the optimization function is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; J_{vr}^N (\rho) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N \left(u(t)-K(\rho) e_v(t) \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Ecological engineering''' uses [[ecology]] and [[engineering]] to predict, design, construct or restore, and manage [[ecosystem]]s that integrate "[[human society]] with its [[natural environment]] for the benefit of both".&lt;ref name = "Mi 98"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering", In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins, key concepts, definitions, and applications ==
Ecological engineering emerged as a new idea in the early 1960s, but its definition has taken several decades to refine, its implementation is still undergoing adjustment, and its broader recognition as a new paradigm is relatively recent. Ecological engineering was introduced by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] and others&lt;ref name = "Od 63"&gt;H.T. Odum et al. (1963), ''Experiments with Engineering of Marine Ecosystems'', in: ''Publication of the Institute of Marine Science of the University of Texas'', 9: 374-403.&lt;/ref&gt; as utilizing [[renewable energy|natural energy]] sources as the predominant input to manipulate and control environmental systems. The origins of ecological engineering are in Odum's work with ecological modeling and ecosystem simulation to capture holistic macro-patterns of energy and material flows affecting the efficient use of resources. 

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; summarized five basic concepts that differentiate ecological engineering from other approaches to addressing problems to benefit society and nature: 1) it is based on the self-designing [[carrying capacity|capacity of ecosystems]]; 2) it can be the field (or acid) test of ecological theories; 3) it relies on system approaches; 4) it conserves [[non-renewable energy]] sources; and 5) it supports ecosystem and [[biological conservation]].

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 89"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering" In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to define ecological engineering as designing societal services such that they benefit society and nature, and later noted&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1993), "Ecological Engineering - A Cooperative Role with the Planetary Life Support Systems" in: ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology'', 27: 438-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1996), "Ecological Engineering: a new paradigm for engineers and ecologists", In: P.C. Schulze (Editor), ''Engineering Within Ecological Constraints''. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 114-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jørgensen (2003), "Ecological engineering: A field whose time has come", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 20(5): 363-377.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = "MJ 04"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (2004), "Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration". John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the design should be systems based, sustainable, and integrate society with its natural environment.  

Bergen et al.&lt;ref name = "Be 01"&gt;S.D. Bergen et al. (2001), "Design Principles for Ecological Engineering", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 18: 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt; defined ecological engineering as: 1) utilizing ecological science and theory; 2) applying to all types of ecosystems; 3) adapting engineering design methods; and 4) acknowledging a guiding value system.  

Barrett (1999)&lt;ref name = "Ba 99"&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. R. Barrett|year=1999|title=Ecological engineering in water resources: The benefits of collaborating with nature|journal=Water International|volume=24|pages=182–188|doi=10.1080/02508069908692160}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a more literal definition of the term: "the design, construction, operation and management (that is, engineering) of landscape/aquatic structures and associated plant and animal communities (that is, ecosystems) to benefit humanity and, often, nature."  Barrett continues: "other terms with equivalent or similar meanings include [[ecotechnology]] and two terms most often used in the [[erosion control]] field: soil bioengineering and biotechnical engineering.  However, ecological engineering should not be confused with '[[biotechnology]]' when describing genetic engineering at the cellular level, or '[[bioengineering]]' meaning construction of artificial body parts."

The applications in ecological engineering can be classified into 3 spatial scales: 1) mesocosms (~0.1 to 100s of meters); 2) ecosystems (~1 to 10s of km); and 3) regional systems (&gt;10s of km). The complexity of the design likely increases with the spatial scale. Applications are increasing in breadth and depth, and likely impacting the field's definition, as more opportunities to design and use ecosystems as interfaces between society and nature are explored.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Wetlands, ''Ecological Engineering'', webtext 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of ecological engineering has focused on the creation or restoration of ecosystems, from [[Land degradation|degraded]] [[wetlands]] to multi-celled tubs and [[greenhouse]]s that integrate microbial, fish, and plant services to process human [[wastewater]] into products such as fertilizers, flowers, and [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.J Todd &amp; J. Todd|year=1994|title=From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design|location=Berkeley|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1556431500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of ecological engineering in cities have emerged from collaboration with other fields such as [[landscape architecture]], [[urban planning]], and [[urban horticulture]],&lt;ref name = "Be 01"/&gt; to address human health and biodiversity, as targeted by the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]], with holistic projects such as [[stormwater management]]. Applications of ecological engineering in rural landscapes have included wetland treatment&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Nahlik and W.J. Mitsch. (2006), "Tropical Treatment Wetlands Dominated by Free-Floating Macrophytes for Water Quality Improvement in Costa Rica", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; and community [[reforestation]] through traditional ecological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;S.A.W. Diemont and others (2006), "Lancandon Maya Forest Management: Restoration of Soil Fertility using Native Tree Species", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 205-212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Permaculture]] is an example of broader applications that have emerged as distinct disciplines from ecological engineering, where [[David Holmgren]] cites the influence of [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] in development of permaculture.

== Design guidelines, functional classes, and design principles ==

Ecological engineering design will combine [[systems ecology]] with the process of [[engineering design]]. [[Engineering design]] typically involves problem formulation (goal), problem analysis (constraints), alternative solutions search, decision among alternatives, and specification of a complete solution.&lt;ref&gt;E.V. Krik&lt;/ref&gt; A temporal design framework is provided by Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"&gt;M.D. Matlock and others (2001), "Ecological Engineering: A Rationale for Standardized Curriculum and Professional Certification in the United States", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 17: 403-409.&lt;/ref&gt; stating the design solutions are considered in ecological time. In selecting between alternatives, the design should incorporate [[ecological economics]] in design evaluation&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and acknowledge a guiding value system which promotes biological conservation, benefiting society and nature.&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Be 01"/&gt; 

Ecological engineering utilizes [[systems ecology]] with engineering design to obtain a holistic view of the interactions within and between society and nature. Ecosystem simulation with [[Energy Systems Language]] (also known as energy circuit language or energese) by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] is one illustration of this systems ecology approach &lt;ref&gt;Brown, M.T. (2004) A picture is worth a thousand words: energy systems language and simulation. Ecological Modelling 178(1-2), 83-100.&lt;/ref&gt;. This holistic model development and simulation defines the system of interest, identifies the system's boundary, and diagrams how energy and material moves into, within, and out of, a system in order to identify how to use renewable resources through ecosystem processes and increase sustainability. The system it describes is a collection (i.e., group) of components (i.e., parts), connected by some type of interaction or interrelationship, that collectively responds to some stimulus or demand and fulfills some specific purpose or function. By understanding systems ecology the ecological engineer can more efficiently design with ecosystem components and processes within the design, utilize renewable energy and resources, and increase sustainability.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified five Functional Classes for ecological engineering designs:
# Ecosystem utilized to reduce/solve pollution problem. Example: phytoremediation, wastewater wetland, and bioretention of stormwater to filter excess nutrients and metals pollution
# Ecosystem imitated or copied to address resource problem. Example: forest restoration, replacement wetlands, and installing street side rain gardens to extend canopy cover to optimize residential and urban cooling
# Ecosystem recovered after disturbance. Example: mine land restoration, lake restoration, and channel aquatic restoration with mature riparian corridors
# Ecosystem modified in ecologically sound way. Example: selective timber harvest, biomanipulation, and introduction of predator fish to reduce planktivorous fish, increase zooplankton, consume algae or phytoplankton, and clarify the water.
# Ecosystems used for benefit without destroying balance. Example: sustainable agro-ecosystems, multispecies aquaculture, and introducing agroforestry plots into residential property to generate primary production at multiple vertical levels.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified 19 Design Principles for ecological engineering, yet not all are expected to contribute to any single design:
# Ecosystem structure &amp; function are determined by forcing functions of the system;
# Energy inputs to the ecosystems and available storage of the ecosystem is limited;
# Ecosystems are open and dissipative systems (not thermodynamic balance of energy, matter, entropy, but spontaneous appearance of complex, chaotic structure);
# Attention to a limited number of governing/controlling factors is most strategic in preventing pollution or restoring ecosystems;
# Ecosystem have some homeostatic capability that results in smoothing out and depressing the effects of strongly variable inputs;
# Match recycling pathways to the rates of ecosystems and reduce pollution effects;
# Design for pulsing systems wherever possible;
# Ecosystems are self-designing systems;
# Processes of ecosystems have characteristic time and space scales that should be accounted for in environmental management;
# Biodiversity should be championed to maintain an ecosystem's self design capacity;
# Ecotones, transition zones, are as important for ecosystems as membranes for cells; 
# Coupling between ecosystems should be utilized wherever possible;
# The components of an ecosystem are interconnected, interrelated, and form a network; consider direct as well as indirect efforts of ecosystem development;
# An ecosystem has a history of development;
# Ecosystems and species are most vulnerable at their geographical edges;
# Ecosystems are hierarchical systems and are parts of a larger landscape;
# Physical and biological processes are interactive, it is important to know both physical and biological interactions and to interpret them properly;
# Eco-technology requires a holistic approach that integrates all interacting parts and processes as far as possible;
# Information in ecosystems is stored in structures.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified the following considerations prior implementing an ecological engineering design: 
* Create conceptual model of determine the parts of nature connected to the project;
* Implement a computer model to simulate the impacts and uncertainty of the project;
* Optimize the project to reduce uncertainty and increase beneficial impacts. 

== Academic curriculum (colleges)==

An academic curriculum has been proposed for ecological engineering,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and institutions around the world are starting programs. Key elements of this curriculum are: [[environmental engineering]]; [[systems ecology]]; [[restoration ecology]]; [[ecological modeling]]; quantitative ecology; economics of ecological engineering, and technical [[Course (education)#Elective and required courses|electives]]. &lt;ref&gt;Diemont, S.W., T.J. Lawrence, and T.A. Endreny. "Envisioning Ecological Engineering Education: An International Survey of the Educational and Professional Community", Ecological Engineering, 36(4): 570-578, 2010. DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.12.004 &lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing this set of courses are prerequisites courses in physical, biological, and chemical subject areas, and integrated design experiences. According to Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; the design should identify constraints, characterize solutions in ecological time, and incorporate ecological economics in design evaluation. Economics of ecological engineering has been demonstrated using energy principles for a wetland.,&lt;ref&gt;S. Ton, H.T. Odum &amp; J.J. Delfino (1998),  "Ecological Economic Evaluation of Wetland Management Alternatives", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 11: 291-302.&lt;/ref&gt; and using nutrient valuation for a dairy farm &lt;ref&gt;C. Pizarro and others, ''An Economic Assessment of Algal Turf Scrubber Technology for Treatment of Dairy Manure Effluent. Ecological Engineering, 26(12): 321-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreign language''' is a [[language]] originally from another country than the speaker. However, there must a be defined distinction between foreign and second language. It is also a language not spoken in the native country of the person referred to, i.e., an [[English language|English]] speaker living in [[Spain]] can say that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a foreign language to him or her. These two characterisations do not exhaust the possible definitions, however, and the label is occasionally applied in ways that are variously misleading or factually inaccurate. 

Some children learn more than one language from birth or from a very young age: they are [[bilingual]] or [[multilingualism|multilingual]]. These children can be said to have two, three or more mother tongues: neither language is foreign to that child, even if one language is a foreign language for the vast majority of people in the child's birth country. For example, a child learning English from his [[England|English]] father and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language to him. This is common in countries such as [[India]], [[South Africa]], or [[Canada]] due to these countries having multiple official languages.

In general, it is believed that children have advantage to learning a foreign language over adults. However, there are studies which have shown adult students are better at foreign language learning than child students. It is because adults have pre-existing knowledge of how grammar works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merritt, Anne.

==Foreign language education and ability==
:''See main article: [[Language education]]''
{{globalise/Europe|date=November 2010}}

Most schools around the world teach at least one foreign language and most colleges and high schools require foreign language before graduation.  By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being [[Ireland]], where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English, but neither is considered a foreign language (although Irish pupils do study a third European language). On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, learners have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language is studied at age six, and in [[Flemish Community|Flanders]] at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm#2.6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112090730/http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm |date=2007-01-12 }} Children in the [[Flemish Community|Flemish Community of Belgium]] start learning [[French language|French]] at age 10, [[English language|English]] at 12 or 13 and, if chosen so, mostly [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at age 15 or 16, but with only the first two being obligatory. In the [[Brussels Capital Region]], however, French is taught starting at age 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wales]], all children are taught [[Welsh language|Welsh]] from the first year of primary school. The Welsh language is also compulsory up to the age of 16, although a formal [[GCSE]] qualification is optional.

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority/regional language community use partial [[language immersion|immersion]] to teach both the minority and the state language. This method is also highly used in Canada, wherein anglophone students spend all of most of their lessons learning the materials in French.

In 1995, the [[European Commission]]'s White Paper on Education and Training emphasised the importance of schoolchildren learning at least two foreign languages before upper secondary education. The [[Lisbon Summit]] of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language and less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language. In 2001, a European Commission survey found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardise the learning of languages across Europe.

An article from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' claims that only 1 percent of the adults within the American population consider themselves proficient in speaking a foreign language. This is in stark contrast to many other countries, where the percentage is much higher. Even though there are many benefits that come with learning a foreign language, schools across the United States continue to cut foreign language from their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Amelia (2015). America's Lacking Language Skills. 'The Atlantic'.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Language education}}

In recent years, [[computer-assisted language learning]] has been integrated into foreign language education and computer programs with varying levels of interactional relationship between computer and the language learner have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Palmberg, R. (1989). Integrating CALL into Foreign-Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; Language learning aids such as [[foreign language writing aid]] and [[foreign language reading aid]], targeted at the specific language skills of foreign language learners, are also alternative instruments available for foreign language learners.

==Research into foreign language learning==
{{Main|Second language acquisition}}

In 2004, a report by the Michel Thomas Language Centre in the [[United Kingdom]] suggested that speaking a second language could increase an average worker's salary by £3000 (€3 300) a year, or £145 000 (€159 000) in a lifetime. Further results showed that nine out of 10 British companies thought their businesses could benefit from better language skills. Studies show that a person that is bilingual or multilingual, can make a greater salary than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. Also due to the increase of international population, a multilingual person can easily communicate and translate to perspective viewers.

Also in 2004, a study by [[University College London]] (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Learning languages 'boosts brain'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser [[grey matter]] than those who learned one later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specific nerve cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Helen|date=2004-07-21|title=Grey matter matters for intellect|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news040719-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217224556/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|title=Thinking in a Foreign Language Makes Decisions More Rational|last=Keim|first=Brandon|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001301/https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Diaz (1983). Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.&lt;/ref&gt; helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.

==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==
{{underlinked|section|date=November 2012}}

There are no major differences in different definitions that different writers have provided about foreign language and second language, although not many of them differentiate these two terms. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and [[TEFL]] (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows some attention of different researchers to the concepts of foreign language and second language.

Richards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide this information about second language:

"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's native language [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfils many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home)."

They also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).

Crystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).

Stern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after World War II in international organisations, such as UNESCO, in order to meet nationalist susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.
Fasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.

So, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).

A 'second language' usually has official status or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, Persian is a second language for Kurdish people, but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning Kurdish. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an Iranian person goes to USA, then English becomes a second language for him or her. Thus British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. In Kermanshah or Kurdistan, we can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.

The purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.

There are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.

Second language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.

[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.

The major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:

# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.
# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.
# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.
# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.
# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.

There are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.

There is often a distinction between acquisition and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.

The distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.

Nevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, immigrants to the US can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.

The idea of human artifacts being given life has fascinated humankind for as long as people have been recording their myths and stories.  Whether [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] or [[Frankenstein]], humanity has been fascinated with the idea of [[artificial life]].

== Pre-computer ==

[[Automaton]]s were quite a novelty.  In the days before computers and electronics, some were very sophisticated, using [[pneumatics]], [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]]. The first automata were conceived during the third and second centuries BC and these were demonstrated by the theorems of [[Hero of Alexandria]], which included sophisticated mechanical and hydraulic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Droz, Edmond. (April 1962), From joined doll to talking robot, New Scientist, vol. 14, no. 282. pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his notable works were included in the book ''Pneumatics'', which was also used for constructing machines until early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology Analysed: Tools for Discussion and Evaluation|last=Engelhard|first=Margret|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9783319251431|location=Cham|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1490, Leonardo Da Vinci also constructed an armored knight, which is considered the first humanoid robot in Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Mobile Robot Control|last=Tzafestas|first=Spyros|publisher=Elsevier|year=2014|isbn=9780124170490|location=Waltham, MA|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early famous examples include [[al-Jazari]]'s [[humanoid robot]]s. This Arabic inventor once constructed a band of automata, which can be commanded to play different pieces of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Year by Year , Dorling Kindersley, 2013: Science Year by Year|last=Winston|first=Robert|publisher=DK|year=2013|isbn=9781409316138|location=London|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s [[digesting Duck|artificial duck]] exhibited in 1735, which had thousands of moving parts and one of the first to mimic a biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cellular Automaton Modeling of Biological Pattern Formation: Characterization, Examples, and Analysis, 2nd edition|last=Deutsch|first=Andreas|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2018|isbn=9781489979780|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duck could reportedly eat and digest, drink, quack, and splash in a pool.  It was exhibited all over Europe until it fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/courses/v610051/gelmanr/ling.html| title=Gallery of Automata| accessdate=2006-03-03| first=Rony| last=Gelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it wasn't until the invention of cheap computing power that [[artificial life]] as a legitimate science began in earnest, steeped more in the theoretical and computational than the mechanical and mythological.

==1950s&amp;ndash;1970s==
One of the earliest thinkers of the modern age to postulate the potentials of artificial life, separate from [[artificial intelligence]], was math and computer prodigy [[John von Neumann]].  At the [[Hixon Symposium]], hosted by [[Linus Pauling]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in the late 1940s, von Neumann delivered a lecture titled "The General and Logical Theory of Automata."  He defined an "automaton" as any machine whose behavior proceeded logically from step to step by combining information from the environment and its own programming, and said that natural organisms would in the end be found to follow similar simple rules.  He also spoke about the idea of [[self-replicating machine]]s.  He postulated a machine &amp;ndash; a [[kinematic automaton]] &amp;ndash; made up of a control computer, a construction arm, and a long series of instructions, floating in a lake of parts.  By following the instructions that were part of its own body, it could create an identical machine.  He followed this idea by creating (with [[Stanislaw Ulam]]) a purely logic-based automaton, not requiring a physical body but based on the changing states of the cells in an infinite grid &amp;ndash; the first [[cellular automaton]].  It was extraordinarily complicated compared to later CAs, having hundreds of thousands of cells which could each exist in one of twenty-nine states, but von Neumann felt he needed the complexity in order for it to function not just as a self-replicating "machine", but also as a [[universal computer]] as defined by [[Alan Turing]].  This "[[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]" read from a tape of instructions and wrote out a series of cells that could then be made active to leave a fully functional copy of the original machine and its tape. Von Neumann worked on his [[automata theory]] intensively right up to his death, and considered it his most important work.

[[Homer Jacobson]] illustrated basic self-replication in the 1950s with a model train set &amp;ndash; a seed "organism" consisting of a "head" and "tail" boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new "organisms" identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.
[[Edward F. Moore]] proposed "Artificial Living Plants", which would be floating factories which could create copies of themselves.  They could be programmed to perform some function (extracting fresh water, harvesting minerals from seawater) for an investment that would be relatively small compared to the huge returns from the exponentially growing numbers of factories.  [[Freeman Dyson]] also studied the idea, envisioning self-replicating machines sent to explore and exploit other planets and moons, and a NASA group called the Self-Replicating Systems Concept Team performed a 1980 study on the feasibility of a self-building lunar factory.

University of Cambridge professor [[John Horton Conway]] invented the most famous cellular automaton in the 1960s.  He called it the [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]], and publicized it through [[Martin Gardner]]'s column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine.

==1970s&amp;ndash;1980s==
Philosophy scholar [[Arthur Burks]], who had worked with von Neumann (and indeed, organized his papers after Neumann's death), headed the Logic of Computers Group at the [[University of Michigan]].  He brought the overlooked views of 19th century American thinker [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] into the modern age.  Peirce was a strong believer that all of nature's workings were based on logic (though not always deductive logic).  The Michigan group was one of the few groups still interested in alife and CAs in the early 1970s; one of its students, [[Tommaso Toffoli]] argued in his PhD thesis that the field was important because its results explain the simple rules that underlay complex effects in nature.  Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were [[Reversible computing|reversible]], just as the true universe is considered to be.

[[Christopher Langton]] was an unconventional researcher, with an undistinguished academic career that led him to a job programming [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] mainframes for a hospital.  He became enthralled by Conway's Game of Life, and began pursuing the idea that the computer could emulate living creatures.  After years of study (and a near-fatal hang-gliding accident), he began attempting to actualize Von Neumann's CA and the work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who had simplified Von Neumann's original twenty-nine state monster to one with only eight states.  He succeeded in creating the first self-replicating computer organism in October 1979, using only an [[Apple II]] desktop computer.  He entered Burks' graduate program at the Logic of Computers Group in 1982, at the age of 33, and helped to found a new discipline.

Langton's official conference announcement of Artificial Life I was the earliest description of a field which had previously barely existed:&lt;ref&gt;Langton, C.G. (1989) "Artificial Life", in ''Artificial Life'', Langton (ed), (Addison-Wesley:Reading, MA) page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Artificial life is the study of artificial systems that exhibit behavior characteristic of natural living systems.  It is the quest to explain life in any of its possible manifestations, without restriction to the particular examples that have evolved on earth.  This includes biological and chemical experiments, computer simulations, and purely theoretical endeavors.  Processes occurring on molecular, social, and evolutionary scales are subject to investigation.  The ultimate goal is to extract the logical form of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Microelectronic technology and genetic engineering will soon give us the capability to create new life forms ''in silico'' as well as ''in vitro''.  This capacity will present humanity with the most far-reaching technical, theoretical and ethical challenges it has ever confronted.  The time seems appropriate for a gathering of those involved in attempts to simulate or synthesize aspects of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ed Fredkin]] founded the Information Mechanics Group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], which united Toffoli, [[Norman Margolus]], [[Gerard Vichniac]], and [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]].  This group created a computer especially designed to execute cellular automata, eventually reducing it to the size of a single circuit board.  This "cellular automata machine" allowed an explosion of alife research among scientists who could not otherwise afford sophisticated computers.

In 1982, computer scientist named [[Stephen Wolfram]] turned his attention to cellular automata.  He explored and categorized the types of [[complexity]] displayed by one-dimensional CAs, and showed how they applied to natural phenomena such as the patterns of seashells and the nature of plant growth.
[[Norman Packard]], who worked with Wolfram at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], used CAs to simulate the growth of snowflakes, following very basic rules.

Computer animator [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] similarly used three simple rules to create recognizable [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour in a [[Boids|computer program]] in 1987 to animate groups of boids.  With no top-down programming at all, the boids produced lifelike solutions to evading obstacles placed in their path.  [[Computer animation]] has continued to be a key commercial driver of alife research as the creators of [[Film|movie]]s attempt to find more realistic and inexpensive ways to animate natural forms such as plant life, animal movement, hair growth, and complicated organic textures.

The Unit of Theoretical Behavioural Ecology at the [[Free University of Brussels]] applied the self-organization theories of [[Ilya Prigogine]] and the work of entomologist [[E.O. Wilson]] to research the behavior of social insects, particularly [[allelomimesis]], in which an individual's actions are dictated by those of a neighbor.  They developed partial differential equations which modeled the shapes created by termites when constructing their nest.  They then compared that to the reaction of real termites to identical changes in laboratory colonies, and refined their theories about the rules which underlay the behavior.

[[J. Doyne Farmer]] was a key figure in tying artificial life research to the emerging field of [[complex adaptive system]]s, working at the [[Center for Nonlinear Studies]] (a basic research section of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]), just as its star chaos theorist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] was leaving.  Farmer and Norman Packard chaired a conference in May 1985 called "Evolution, Games, and Learning", which was to presage many of the topics of later alife conferences.

1390&amp;ndash;1396 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in theories of kin selection, reciprocity, multilevel selection and cultural group selection) was re-introduced via artificial life by [[Peter Turchin]] and Mikhail Burtsev in 2006. Previously, [[game theory]] has been utilized in similar investigation, however, that approach was deemed to be rather limiting in its amount of possible strategies and debatable set of payoff rules. The alife model designed here, instead, is based upon [[Conway's Game of Life]] but with much added complexity (there are over 10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; strategies that can potentially emerge). Most significantly, the interacting agents are characterized by external phenotype markers which allows for recognition amongst in-group members. In effect, it is shown that given the capacity to perceive these markers, agents within the system are then able to evolve new group behaviors under minimalistic assumptions. On top of the already known strategies of the bourgeois-[[hawk-dove game]], here two novel modes of cooperative attack and defense arise from the simulation.

For the setup, this two-dimensional artificial world is divided into cells, each empty or containing a resource bundle. An empty cell can acquire a resource bundle with a certain probability per unit of time and lose it when an agent consumes the resource. Each agent is plainly constructed with a set of receptors, effectors (the components that govern the agents' behavior), and neural net which connect the two. In response to the environment, an agent may rest, eat, reproduce by division, move, turn and attack. All actions{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} &lt;!--is this true? (see next comment)--&gt; expend energy taken from its internal energy storage; once that is depleted, the agent dies. Consumption of resource, as well as other agents after defeating them, yields an increase &lt;!--or should this say "a net increase"?--&gt; in the energy storage. Reproduction is modeled as being asexual while the offspring receive half the parental energy. Agents are also equipped with sensory inputs that allow them to detect resources or other members within a parameter{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} in addition to its own level of vitality. As for the phenotype markers, they do not influence behavior but solely function as indicator of 'genetic' similarity. Heredity is achieved by having the relevant information be inherited by the offspring and subjected to a set rate of mutation.

The objective of the investigation is to study how the presence of phenotype markers affects the model's range of evolving cooperative strategies. In addition, as the resource available in this 2D environment is capped, the simulation also serves to determine the effect of environmental carrying capacity on their emergence.

One previously unseen strategy is termed the "raven". These agents leave cells with in-group members, thus avoiding intra-specific competition, and attack out-group members voluntarily. Another strategy, named the 'starling', involves the agent sharing cells with in-group members. Despite individuals having smaller energy storage due to resource partitioning, this strategy permits highly effective defense against large invaders via the advantage in numbers. Ecologically speaking, this resembles the [[mobbing behavior]] that characterizes many species of small birds when they collectively defend against the predator.

In conclusion, the research claims that the simulated results have important implications for the evolution of [[territoriality (ethology)|territoriality]] by showing that within the alife framework it is possible to "model not only how one strategy displaces another, but also the very process by which new strategies emerge from a large quantity of possibilities".&lt;ref&gt;Burtsev M, Turchin P. 2006. Evolution of cooperative strategies from first principles. Nature&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is also underway to create [[computational biomodeling|cellular models of artificial life]].  Initial work on building a complete biochemical model of cellular behavior is underway as part of a number of different research projects, namely [[Blue Gene]] which seeks to understand the mechanisms behind [[protein folding]].

The '''''IAJRC Journal''''' is an American quarterly [[magazine]] published by the [[International Association of Jazz Record Collectors]]. The journal was established in 1968, 4 years after the association was founded in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="Hoffmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; The first issue was published during the first quarter of 1968. It covers the [[history of jazz]] — which includes the history of jazz criticism and jazz discography.

== History and background ==
The journal reviews about 200 albums and 12 books, annually. One of its sister products is the IAJRC [[record label]], which, as of 2014, has in excess of 77 titles.

The journal is not formally [[peer reviewed]]. Because the organization is bent towards rare and old recordings, coverage by the journal leans towards, but is not limited to, historic jazz. Its contributors have mostly been amateur jazz enthusiasts, but also include amateur and professional discographers, jazz critics, [[musicologist]]s, musicians, music library archivists, and academics.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

== Editor ==
Ian R. Tiele ( [[Brookfield, Illinois]]) has been the journal's [[Editor-in-chief|editor]] since 2012.

'''iBiquity Digital Corporation''' is a [[company (law)|company]] formed by the [[merger]] of USA Digital Radio and Lucent Digital Radio, with the [[goal]] of creating an [[in-band on-channel]] (IBOC) [[digital radio]] [[system]] for the [[United States]] and around the world.  Based in [[Columbia, Maryland]], with additional offices in [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]], and [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], iBiquity is a privately held, intellectual properties company, whose investors include global leaders in the technology, broadcasting, manufacturing, media and financial industries.

IBOC can operate on both [[AM band]] and [[FM band]] broadcasts either in a digital-only mode, or in a "hybrid" digital+analog mode.  Most broadcasters for the foreseeable future will use the hybrid method, reportedly giving AM stations FM quality sound, while allowing FM stations to broadcast mp3 audio (~96kbps). The stations can split the MP3 bandwidth to carry multiple audio program streams (called HD2 or HD3 multicast channels) as well as show on-screen text data such as song title and artist, traffic and weather information. Nearly 2,000 stations in the US broadcast with this system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.ibiquity.com&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is marketed under the trademark [[HD Radio]].  It is the only technology approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for digital AM and FM broadcasting in the United States. Due in large part to its ability to deliver digital audio services while leveraging existing analog spectrum (by broadcasting digital information on the [[sideband]]s), commercial implementation of the technology is gaining momentum in various countries on one side of the world, including [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and [[The Philippines]]. Testing and demonstrations of the system are also underway in [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Germany]], [[Indonesia]], [[Jamaica]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Thailand]], and [[Ukraine]], among other countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  According to iBiquity Digital, holder of the HD Radio trademark, the "HD" in "HD Radio" does not stand for "High Definition" or "Hybrid Digital". It is simply part of their trademark, and does not have any meaning on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiquity.com/about_us/trademarks iBiquity Digital Corporation - Trademarks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The name "HD Radio" and logo were developed by Lexicon Branding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexicon-branding.com/technology.html Lexicon Branding Technology Portfolio]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2015, iBiquity announced that [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] was purchasing them for $USD 172 million, bringing the [[HD Radio]] technology under the same banner as DTS' eponymous theater surround sound systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dts.com/news/articles/2015/08/dts-and-ibiquity-digital-corp.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ITU-R 468''' (originally defined in [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] recommendation 468-4; sometimes referred to as '''CCIR-1k''') is a standard relating to [[noise measurement]], widely used when measuring noise in audio systems.  The standard,&lt;ref name="itu"&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMMENDATION ITU-R BS.468-4 - Measurement of audio-frequency noise voltage|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.468-4-198607-I!!PDF-E.pdf|website=www.itu.int|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; now referred to as ITU-R BS.468-4, defines a [[weighting filter]] curve, together with a [[quasi-peak]] [[rectifier]] having special characteristics as defined by specified [[tone-burst]] tests.  It is currently maintained by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] who took it over from the CCIR.

It is used especially in the UK, Europe, and former countries of the [[British Empire]] such as Australia and South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is less well known in the USA where [[A-weighting]] has always been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95|title=1910.95 - Occupational noise exposure. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M-weighting''' is a closely related filter, an offset version of the same curve, without the quasi-peak detector.  See [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting#Present usage of 468-weighting|Present usage of 468-weighting]].

== Explanation ==
While most audio engineers are familiar with the [[A-weighting]] curve, which was based on the 40 phon [[equal-loudness contour]] derived initially by [[Fletcher-Munson curves|Fletcher and Munson]] (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an [[ITU]] standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for [[sound level meters]], A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-[[White noise|white]] or [[Pink noise|pink]]) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with quasi-peak measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former [[British Commonwealth]] countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by [[BBC]] test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with quasi-peak measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by switching transients in another.

== History ==
=== Original research ===
Developments in the 1960s, in particular the spread of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] broadcasting and the development of the [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassette]] with [[Dolby-B Noise Reduction]], alerted engineers to the need for a weighting curve that gave subjectively meaningful results on the typical random noise that limited the performance of broadcast circuits, equipment and radio circuits. A-weighting was not giving consistent results, especially on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio transmissions and Compact Cassette recording where [[preemphasis]] of high frequencies was resulting in increased noise readings that did not correlate with subjective effect. Early efforts to produce a better weighting curve led to a DIN standard that was adopted for European Hi-Fi equipment measurement for a while.

Experiments in the [[BBC]] led to [[BBC Research Department]] Report EL-17, ''The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits'',&lt;ref&gt;BBC Research Department Report - The assessment of noise in audio-frequency circuits. http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1968-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which experiments on numerous test subjects were reported, using a variety of noises ranging from clicks to tone-bursts to [[pink noise]]. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and quasi-peak detector then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German [[DIN]] standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and quasi-peak rectifier.

The origin of the current ITU-R 468 weighting curve can be traced to 1956.  The 1968 BBC EL-17 report discusses several weighting curves, including one identified as ''D.P.B.'' which was chosen as superior to the alternatives: A.S.A, C.C.I.F and O.I.R.T.  The report's graph of the DPB curve is identical to that of the ITU-R 486 curve, except that the latter extends to slightly lower and higher frequencies.  The BBC report states that this curve was given in a "contribution by the D.B.P. (The Telephone Administration of the Federal German Republic) in the Red Book Vol. 1 1957 covering the first plenary assembly of the CCITT (Geneva 1956)". D.B.P. is [[Deutsche Bundespost]], the German post office which provides telephone service in Germany as the GPO does in the UK.  The BBC report states "this characteristic is based on subjective tests described by Belger." and cites a 1953 paper by E. Belger.    

Dolby Laboratories took up the new CCIR-468 weighting for use in measuring noise on their noise reduction systems, both in cinema (Dolby A) and on cassette decks (Dolby B), where other methods of measurement were failing to show up the advantage of such noise reduction. Some Hi-Fi column writers took up 468 weighting enthusiastically, observing that it reflected the roughly 10dB improvement in noise observed subjectively on cassette recordings when using Dolby B while other methods could indicate an actual worsening in some circumstances, because they did not sufficiently attenuate noise above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

=== Standards ===
[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] Recommendation 468-1 was published soon after this report, and appears to have been based on the BBC work. Later versions up to CCIR468-4 differed only in minor changes to permitted tolerances. This standard was then incorporated into many other national and international standards (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) and adopted widely as the standard method for measuring noise, in broadcasting, professional audio, and '[[Hi-Fi]]' specifications throughout the 1970s. When the CCIR ceased to exist, the standard was officially taken over by the [[ITU-R]] ([[International Telecommunication Union]]). Current work on this standard occurs primarily in the maintenance of IEC 60268, the international standard for sound systems.

The CCIR curve differs greatly from A-weighting in the 5 to 8&amp;nbsp;kHz region where it peaks to +12.2 dB at 6.3&amp;nbsp;kHz, the region in which we appear to be extremely sensitive to noise. While it has been said (incorrectly) that the difference is due to a requirement for assessing noise intrusiveness in the presence of programme material, rather than just loudness, the BBC report makes clear the fact that this was not the basis of the experiments. The real reason for the difference probably relates to the way in which our ears analyse sounds in terms of spectral content along the [[cochlea]]. This behaves like a [[filter bank|set of closely spaced filters]] with a roughly constant [[Q factor]], that is, bandwidths proportional to their centre frequencies. High frequency [[hair cell]]s would therefore be sensitive to a greater proportion of the total energy in noise than low frequency hair cells. Though hair-cell responses are not exactly constant Q, and matters are further complicated by the way in which the brain integrates adjacent hair-cell outputs, the resultant effect appears roughly as a tilt centred on 1&amp;nbsp;kHz imposed on the A-weighting.

Dependent on spectral content, 468-weighted measurements of noise are generally about 11 dB higher than A-weighted, and this is probably a factor in the recent trend away from 468-weighting in equipment specifications as cassette tape use declines. 

It is important to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22&amp;nbsp;Hz to 22&amp;nbsp;kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses [[root mean square|RMS]] detection for no particular reason{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]] take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This [[quasi-peak]] measurement is also called [[psophometric weighting]].

This was once more important because outside broadcasts were carried over 'music circuits' that used telephone lines, with clicks from [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] and other electromechanical telephone exchanges. It now finds fresh relevance in the measurement of noise on computer 'Audio Cards' which commonly suffer clicks as drives start and stop.

== Present usage of 468-weighting ==
468-weighting is also used in weighted distortion measurement at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Weighting the distortion residue after removal of the fundamental emphasises high-order harmonics, but only up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or so where the ears response falls off. This results in a single measurement (sometimes called [[distortion residue]] measurement) which has been claimed to correspond well with subjective effect even for power amplifiers where [[crossover distortion]] is known to be far more audible than normal THD ([[Total harmonic distortion]]) measurements would suggest.

468-weighting is still demanded by the BBC and many other broadcasters,&lt;ref name="Lindos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lindos.co.uk/cgi-bin/FlexiData.cgi?SOURCE=Articles&amp;VIEW=full&amp;id=10 |title=468 - Weighting in Detail |publisher=Lindos |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increasing awareness of its existence and the fact that it is more valid on random noise where pure tones do not exist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Often both A-weighted and 468-weighted figures are quoted for noise, especially in microphone specifications.

While not intended for this application, the 468 curve has also been used (offset to place the 0 dB point at 2 kHz rather than 1 kHz) as "M weighting" in standards such as ISO 21727&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:21727:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 21727:2016(en) Cinematography — Method of measurement of perceived loudness of short duration motion-picture audio material|last=|first=|date=2016|website=ISO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to gauge loudness or annoyance of cinema soundtracks. This application of the weighting curve does not include the quasi-peak detector specified in the ITU standard.

==Summary of specification ==
Note: this is not the full definitive standard.
===Weighting curve specification ( Weighted measurement)===
The weighting curve is specified by both a circuit diagram of a weighting network and a table of amplitude responses.

[[File:Itu-r 468-circuit.png]]

Above is the ITU-R 468 Weighting Filter Circuit Diagram.  The source and sink impedances are both 600 ohms (resistive), as shown in the diagram.  The values are taken directly from the ITU-R 468 specification.  Note that since this circuit is purely passive, it cannot create the additional 12dB gain required; any results must be corrected by a factor of 8.1333, or +18.2dB.

The values of the amplitude response table slightly differ from those resulting from the circuit diagram, e.g. because of the finite resolution of the numerical values. In the standard it is said that the 33.06&amp;nbsp;nF capacitor may be adjusted or an active filter may be used.

Modeling at hand the circuit above and some calculus give this formula to get the amplitude response in dB for any given frequency value :


:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{ITU}(f) = \frac{1.246332637532143\cdot10^{-4} \, f}{\sqrt{(h_1(f))^2 + (h_2(f))^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ITU}(f) = 18.2+20\log_{10}\left(R_\mathrm{ITU}(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;h_1(f)=-4.737338981378384\cdot10^{-24} \, f^6 + 2.043828333606125\cdot10^{-15} \, f^4 - 1.363894795463638\cdot10^{-7} \, f^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_2(f)=1.306612257412824\cdot10^{-19} \, f^5  - 2.118150887518656\cdot10^{-11} \, f^3 + 5.559488023498642\cdot10^{-4} \, f&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta)''' is a teaching and research institute at the [[ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture|Department of Architecture]] of [[ETH Zurich]], situated on the ETH Zurich’s Hönggerberg Campus site.

== History ==
The Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) was founded on 1 January 1967 as a research body at the Architecture Department of ETH Zurich. &lt;ref&gt;  For the history of the institute see Martin Fröhlich, “Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH-Zürich”, in Unsere Kunstdenkmaler, 24, no. 1 (1973), pp. 16–20; Katharina Medici-Mall, “Sammeln, forschen, ausstellen, publizieren: Das Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH Zürich”, Aktuelles Bauen, 18 (April 1983), pp. 23–6; Ruth Hanisch and Steven Spier, “ ‘History is not the Past but Another Mightier Presence’: The Founding of the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich and its Effects on Swiss Architecture”, The Journal of Architecture, 14, no. 6 (2009), pp. 655–86.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The opening symposium was held on 23 June 1967. &lt;ref&gt;Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur (ed.), Reden und Vortrag zur Eröffnung (Birkhäuser: Basle, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since its beginnings in 1967, the past and the present, theory and practice, have been the cornerstones and reference framework for the work undertaken at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta). Besides teaching activities in the fields of the history of art and architecture, [[architectural theory]] and [[urban design]], the institute’s core focus since its launch has lain in mediating and exploring architecture in its historical depth and thematic breadth. The results of the institute’s in-house research, which is primarily influenced by the areas of interest of the teaching staff and the holdings of the simultaneously established archive, have been presented since 1968 in a publication series. These first appeared in cooperation with the Birkhäuser publishing house (in the “rainbow series”), later with the Ammann publishing house and since the mid-1980s in the [[gta Verlag]], which today enjoys the reputation of being one of the leading architecture publishers.

The absorption of the so-called [[Gottfried Semper|Semper]] Archive from the ETH Bibliothek on the occasion of the creation of the institute forms the foundation of the [[gta Archives]], which over time has advanced to become an internationally renowned research facility. Since then, the main acquisition emphasis has been on the architecture of the nineteenth century and the pre-modern, modern (Swiss) architecture in the form of collections ([[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM)), as well as advance legacies and bequests of individual architects of international stature  (including [[Karl Moser]], [[Hans Bernoulli]], [[Lux Guyer]], [[Haefeli Moser Steiger]], [[Ernst Gisel]], [[Fritz Haller]] and [[Trix Haussmann|Trix]] and [[Robert Haussmann]]).

The organisational office for exhibitions by the ETH Zurich’s Department of Architecture became incorporated in the institute in 1974, and – since 1986 as gta Exhibitions – affords a wide public insight into contemporary architectural discourse and current research at the department.

=== Institute directors ===

* [[Adolf Max Vogt]] (1920–2013), director from 1967 to 1974 and 1981 to 1982
* [[Bernhard Hoesli]] (1923–1984), director from 1975 to 1980
* [[Heinz Ronner]] (1924–1992), director from 1983 to 1987
* [[Werner Oechslin]] (born 1944), director from 1987 to 1998 and 1999 to 2006
* [[Kurt W. Forster]] (born 1935), director from 1998 to 1999
* [[Andreas Tönnesmann]] (1953–2014), director from 2006 to 2010
* [[Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani]] (born 1951), director from 2010 to 2016
* [[Laurent Stalder]] (born 1970), director since 2016

===Professorial chairs and divisions ===
Today the institute encompasses the following professorial chairs:
*  Chair of the History and Theory of Architecture, Maarten Delbeke 
*  Adjunct Professor of the History of Architecture of Modernity, Ita Heinze-Greenberg  
*  Chair of Theory of Architecture, Laurent Stalder 
*  Chair of the History of Art and Architecture, Philip Ursprung 
*  Chair of the History of Urban Design (vacant) 

The following divisions assist the research projects and convey their findings:
*  gta Archives 
*  gta Verlag
*  gta Exhibitions 

The gta Institute assists in the promotion of academic newcomers with its own doctoral programme (since 2012). The institute’s educational provisions are supplemented by the programme Master of Studies in the History and Theory of Architecture, which mediates between practice and scholarship (since 1992).
There is a close academic exchange with the Werner Oechslin Library Foundation, associated with the ETH Zurich via a cooperation agreement.

== Teaching and research areas ==

The institute’s task is to empirically appraise and theoretically reflect upon architecture in its historical depth and ideological breadth. Along with the establishing and verification of facts, the gta Institute has always been at pains to review applied methods in terms of their validity as models and to make them beneficial to contemporary architecture. As an institute, the gta researches and teaches the history of knowledge of architecture, building forms and techniques, the function of architecture and its relations to society and politics, the evolution of design and architectural thinking from the beginnings to today, as well as the methodologies of architectural history work ranging from building analysis through to the digital humanities.

The work on the Digital platform is focussed on capture, transfer and integration of [[Real-time data]] from the remote production installations to the decision makers. A risk evaluation across the whole chain is also included. The platform is based on [[open standards]] and enables a higher degree of [[interoperability]]. Requirements for the digital platform come from use cases defined within the [[Oil_and_gas_well_drilling#Drilling|Drilling]] and [[Oil_and_gas_well_drilling#Completion|Completion]], Reservoir and Production and Operations and Maintenance domains. The platform will subsequently be demonstrated through pilots within these three domains.&lt;ref name="IOHNsite"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">'''Integrated Chain Management''' (ICM), also known as '''Integral Chain Management''', is an approach for the reduction of environmental impact of product chains. Such a product chain exists out of an extraction phase, a production phase, a use phase and a waste phase. The ultimate goal of ICM is a reduction of environmental load over the whole chain. Integrated Chain Management is one of the approaches that can be used to come to [[sustainable development]]. Other approaches in this line are the [[Ecological Footprint]] and the [[DTO approach]]. 

Within the ICM approach all phases within the chain must be considered.  Therefore it can be seen as a "cradle to grave" approach. 
Several inputs and outputs can be taken into account when applying the ICM approach. Such as: Energy flows, mass flows, materials, waste flows and emissions.  Within ICM material cycles should be closed where possible and the remainder flows of [[air pollution|emissions]] and waste should be brought within acceptable boundaries. Also the use of resources should be kept to a minimum.  

Integrated chain management should not be mixed up with [[Supply Chain Management]] or [[Integrated Supply Chain Management]]. These concepts do not have the reduction of environmental load as their main goal. 

An important aspect of ICM is that shifting to other phases in the product chain is avoided. For instance, a producer of chairs can choose to leave off an environment unfriendly material in a new product. The producer can even see this as an extra selling point for the customer, but as a consequence the supplier of raw materials has to use much more energy to produce a material with the same qualities. The result of this is that there may no longer be a net environmental reduction across the whole chain. Within the integrated chain management approach this is avoided. 

The chain can be managed by developing new policies and economical or political incentives. Therefore one must have insight into the inputs and outputs of the production chain. Before these policies can be developed one must engage in several actions.  

*Analyse the processes into a preferred level of detail
*Determine the boundaries of the chain. Should links outside the companies be involved as well? 
*Determine whether there should be a focus on just one or on several environmental problems
*Determine on which material flows or energy flows there should be a focus. 

Effective supply chain management can impact virtually all business and production processes

==Example==
An example of applying the ICM approach would be to develop policies in a particular product area. The responsibility of problems caused by the waste stage can be assigned to the producers of these products. This leads to improved product design and new insight in how to put these products in the market. For instance the product can be sold with a disposal contribution. On the price tag of a radio nowadays can be printed:  "this radio costs 25 $ not including the 3 $ disposal contribution" 
The effects can be seen within the whole chain. The producer will try to choose non-polluting materials, as they increase the costs of the waste-stage. The producer of raw materials will try to improve its production process in order to meet the increased demand for 'clean' primary products. And the consumer will be aware that some products give more pressure on the environment than others when its economical lifespan has run out.

'''Interim Alternative Educational Setting''' ('''IAES''') is a term for an educational setting and program other than the student's current placement that enables the student to continue to receive educational services according to his or her [[Individualized Education Program]].  The Individualized Education Program or [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] is a plan determined by a team who develops a set of modifications for the educational program of a [[special education]] student.  The setting is designed to allow the student to continue progress in the regular [[curriculum]] to meet the goals set out by the IEP and to allow students to receive services and modifications designed to help students address problem behavior.

Transmission direction is indicated by an arrow on the label on the right]]An '''isolator''' is a [[Two-port network|two-port]] device that transmits [[microwave]] or [[radio frequency]] power in one direction only. It is used to shield equipment on its input side, from the effects of conditions on its output side; for example, to prevent a microwave source being detuned by a mismatched load.

==Non-reciprocity==
An isolator is a non-[[Reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocal]] device, with a non-[[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[Scattering parameters|scattering matrix]]. An ideal isolator transmits all the power entering [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] 1 to port 2, while absorbing all the power entering port 2, so that to within a phase-factor its S-matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;S = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 \\
  1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

To achieve non-reciprocity, an isolator must necessarily incorporate a non-reciprocal material. At microwave frequencies this material is invariably a [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] which is [[Biasing (electronics)|biased]] by a static magnetic field. The ferrite is positioned within the isolator such that the microwave signal presents it with a rotating magnetic field, with the rotation axis aligned with the direction of the static bias field. The behaviour of the ferrite depends on the sense of rotation with respect to the bias field, and hence is different for microwave signals travelling in opposite directions. Depending on the exact operating conditions, the signal travelling in one direction may either be phase-shifted, displaced from the ferrite or absorbed.

==Types==
[[File:AisladorG.JPG|thumb|right|An [[X band]] isolator consisting of a waveguide [[circulator]] with an external matched load on one port]]
[[File:AisladorC.JPG|thumb|right|Two isolators each consisting of a coax [[circulator]] and a matched load]]

===Resonance absorption===
In this type the ferrite absorbs energy from the microwave signal travelling in one direction. A suitable rotating magnetic field is found in the TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; mode of rectangular [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]. The rotating field exists away from the centre-line of the broad wall, over the full height of the guide. However, to allow heat from the absorbed power to be conducted away, the ferrite does not usually extend from one broad-wall to the other, but is limited to a shallow strip on each face. For a given bias field, resonance absorption occurs over a fairly narrow frequency band, but since in practice the bias field is not perfectly uniform throughout the ferrite, the isolator functions over a somewhat wider band.

===Field displacement===
This type is superficially very similar to a resonance absorption isolator, but the magnetic biasing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself.

The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite near-zero [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal; the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary [[dielectric]] material (with little permeability, as the ferrite is already [[saturation (magnetic)|saturated]] by the bias field). Consequently, for the electromagnetic field of the forward signal, the ferrite has very low [[characteristic impedance|characteristic]] [[wave impedance]], and the field tends to be excluded from the ferrite. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal on the surface of the ferrite where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film.

In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the resistive film on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.

===Using a circulator===
A [[circulator]] is a non-reciprocal three- or four-port device, in which power entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only). So to within a phase-factor, the [[Scattering parameters|scattering matrix]] for a three-port circulator is

:&lt;math&gt;S = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

A two-port isolator is obtained simply by terminating one of the three ports with a [[Transmission line#Matched load|matched load]], which absorbs all the power entering it. The biased ferrite is part of the circulator and causes a differential phase-shift for signals travelling in different directions. The bias field is lower than that needed for resonance absorption, and so this type of isolator does not require such a heavy permanent magnet. Because the power is absorbed in an external load, cooling is less of a problem than with a resonance absorption isolator.

The '''Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony''' (also called "'''Bookville'''" by former residents) was an encampment of banished, registered [[sex offender]]s who were living beneath the [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]]—a highway in [[Miami, Florida]], United States—from 2006 to April 2010. The colony was created by a lobbyist named [[Ron Book]], who wrote ordinances in several different [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] cities to restrict convicted sex offenders from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools, parks, bus stops, or homeless shelters. Since Book was also head of the Miami Homeless Trust, he was also in charge of finding housing for the released sexual offenders. Under these ordinances, the only areas where sex offenders could legally reside within Miami-Dade County were the [[Miami International Airport|Miami Airport]] and the [[Florida Everglades]]. Miami-Dade laws are significantly stricter than State of Florida laws on residency restrictions for sex offenders.  Florida State Law required that no sex offender could live within {{convert|2000|ft|m}} from "where children gather". Under that requirement, housing was possible; however, because of Book's lobbying, the Dade County Commission increased that number to {{convert|2500|ft|m}}, thereby banishing hundreds of local citizens who then began gathering under the Julia Tuttle Causeway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2009-04-16/news/julia-tuttle-bridge-sex-offenders-might-get-a-new-home/ Miami sex offenders form outcast colony], UPI (May 3, 2009).

== Conflicts over responsibility ==
As the number of residents grew, the City of Miami and the State of Florida disagreed over who was ultimately responsible for the sex offenders. Miami City Commissioner Marc Sarnoff, worried about how tourists perceived the colony, prompted an attorney from the Florida Department of Corrections to write a letter to the City of Miami absolving the Department of responsibility. The City of Miami responded by filing a lawsuit against the state, citing public health and safety concerns. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had also filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami for imposing the {{convert|2500|ft|m|adj=on}} rule for sex offenders when the State of Florida's law restricts them to {{convert|1000|ft|m}} from where children congregate. The ACLU said that the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} rule would allow many of the offenders to return home.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;Allen, Greg (July 21, 2009) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106689642&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1001 Bridge Still Home For Miami Sex Offenders], National Public Radio.

Local clergyman Vincent Spann likened the camp to a Biblical [[leper colony]] and offered to house the sex offenders in a manner similar to that which he employed to treat those recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. He predicted it would cost more than a million dollars a year.&lt;ref name="garciaroberts"&gt;Garcia-Roberts, Gus (April 14, 2009).

The ACLU promised to appeal the decision. {{As of|2009}} Miami was facing other lawsuits about moving the sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/southflorida/story/1239101.html Strict Miami-Dade sex-offender law to remain in place] ''The Miami Herald'' (September 18, 2009).

The county also made this ordinance effective throughout the whole county and declared any stricter ordinances passed by other Miami-Dade cities to be superseded and repealed. With this new county ordinance, various pockets of the county were now legal for sex offenders to live in, and most, but not all, of the sex offenders ceased to be homeless. Previously, the sex offenders had been banned in most parts of the county from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools, daycare centers, parks, and in some places even school bus stops.  As of March 2015, however, the problem continues.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Attempts to relocate colony residents==

Throughout the camp's existence, the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, an organization tasked by the county to help end street homelessness in Miami-Dade County, had been working to find permanent housing for all of the sex offenders living under the bridge. The trust is chaired by [[Ron Book]], the lobbyist who helped write and pass into law the {{convert|2500|ft|m|adj=on}} restriction, prompted by the abuse of his daughter at the hands of a hired caretaker. On April 15, 2010, the Trust moved the last of the sex offenders living under the bridge into other housing. However, further protest from nearby communities ensued. Several former residents of the encampment were evicted from a Miami hotel in late April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Valdemoro, Tania (April 25, 2010). "Shorecrest residents unhappy about relocation of sex offenders - Sex offenders? Not in my backyard, Miami residents tell their mayor and other city officials", '' The Miami Herald'', Shorecrest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lebovick, Jennifer; Beasley, Adam (April 20, 2010). "Hotel evicts sex offenders", ''The Miami Herald'', p. 3B.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' reported on the fate of the former Julia Tuttle Causeway colony, which former residents nicknamed "Bookville". Analysts studying the colony unanimously agreed on two relevant issues: the inability to find a stable home for offenders increased the risk that they would re-offend, and the close proximity of offenders to schools or parks did not increase the possibility that past offenders would re-offend. Despite these findings, Book solicited for and applied [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|federal stimulus money]] to buy short-term stays for offenders, eventually costing [[US$]]1,000 a month which, as noted by the ''Herald'', would have been unnecessary without the more stringent law that Book championed. This is incorrect according to David Raymond, former executive director of the Homeless Trust: federal Stimulus funds were never utilized for this population in Miami-Dade County; the funds used were from the local Homeless Food &amp; Beverage Tax.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Rent subsidies, along with job placement services and case management, were provided for up to six months.

Residents of Miami's Shorecrest neighborhood protested about the 13 sex offenders who had relocated there. Book placed another 43 offenders in a trailer park also housing many children. Book forewarned that the stimulus funds for housing the sex offenders would run out. The ''Herald'' reported that out of 1,960 sex offenders who had registered to live in Miami-Dade, 256 stopped reporting their locations to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas, Valerie and Bradley, Walter (November 5, 2011).

Throughout 2013 and 2014, evidence began to reach the news media that there was still a problem of homelessness amongst Miami-Dade sex offenders, despite the county's relaxation of the residency restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In October 2014, the ACLU announced plans to again sue the county over the residency restrictions. A similar lawsuit by the ACLU against Miami-Dade County failed in the 2009 case Exile v. Miami-Dade County, when it was ruled that Florida law does not prevent localities from enacting stricter sex offender residency restrictions. (This is contrary to a [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] ruling that invalidated local sex offender ordinances on those grounds.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}})

'''Jupiter mass''', also called '''Jovian mass''', is the [[units of mass|unit of mass]] equal to the total mass of the planet [[Jupiter]]. This value may refer to the mass of the [[planet]] alone, or the mass of the entire Jovian system to include the [[moons of Jupiter]]. Jupiter is by far the most [[giant planet|massive planet]] in the [[Solar System]]. It is approximately 2.5 times more massive than all of the other planets in the Solar System combined.&lt;ref name="Universe Today"&gt;{{cite web |last=Coffey |first=Jerry |title=Mass of Jupiter |url=https://www.universetoday.com/15141/mass-of-jupiter/ |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |date=18 June 2008 |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter mass is a common unit of [[mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other similarly-sized objects, including the [[outer planet]]s and [[extrasolar planet]]s. It may also be used to describe the masses of [[brown dwarf]]s, as this unit provides a convenient scale for comparison.

==Current best estimates==
The current best known value for the mass of Jupiter can be expressed as {{val|1898130|u=[[Orders of magnitude (mass)|yottagrams]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=(1.89813\;\pm\;0.00019)\times10^{27}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="JPL Planets"/&gt;
which is about 1000 times less massive than the sun (about {{solar mass|0.1%}}):
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=\frac{1}{1047.348644\;\pm\;0.000017}\;M_{Sun}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="CBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#MSMJ2009|website=maia.usno.navy.mil|publisher=IAU Working Group|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in scientific notation,
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 954.7919(15)\times10^{-6}\;M_{Sun} &lt;/math&gt;.
Compared to the mass of Earth, Jupiter is 318 times more massive.
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 317.82838\;M_\oplus &lt;/math&gt;.

==Context and implications==
Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined—this is so massive that its [[barycenter]] with the [[Sun]] lies beyond the [[Photosphere|Sun's surface]] at 1.068&amp;nbsp;[[solar radius|solar radii]] from the Sun's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacDougal |first1=Douglas W. |title=Newton's Gravity |date=November 6, 2012 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9781461454434 |pages=193–211 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |accessdate=July 28, 2016 |language=en |chapter=A Binary System Close to Home: How the Moon and Earth Orbit Each Other |quote=the barycenter is 743,000 km from the center of the sun.

Because the mass of Jupiter is so large compared to the other objects in the solar system, the effects of its gravity must be included when calculating satellite trajectories and the precise orbits of other bodies in the solar system, including Earth's moon and even Pluto.

Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, its atmosphere would collapse, and the planet would shrink.&lt;ref name=Seager2007&gt;{{cite journal

== Gravitational constant==
The mass of Jupiter is derived from the measured value called the [[standard gravitational parameter|Jovian mass parameter]], which is denoted with ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''. The mass of Jupiter is calculated by dividing ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the constant ''[[gravitational constant|G]]''. For celestial bodies such as Jupiter, Earth and the Sun, the value of the ''GM'' product is known to many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more precisely than either factor independently. The limited precision available for ''G'' limits the uncertainty of the derived mass. For this reason, astronomers often prefer to refer to the gravitational parameter, rather than the explicit mass. The ''GM'' products are used when computing the ratio of Jupiter mass relative to other objects.

In 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the ''nominal Jovian mass parameter'' to remain constant regardless of subsequent improvements in measurement precision of {{Jupiter mass}}. This  constant is defined as exactly:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{GM})^\mathrm N_\mathrm J&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|1.2668653|e=17|u=m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
If the explicit mass of Jupiter is needed in SI units, it can be calculated in terms of the [[Gravitational constant]], ''G'' by dividing ''GM'' by ''G''.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1510.07674|last1=Mamajek|first1=E.

==Mass composition==
The majority of Jupiter's mass is hydrogen and helium. These two elements make up more than 87% of the total mass of Jupiter.&lt;ref name = "Jupiters Interior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guillot|first1=Tristan|last2=Stevenson|first2=David J.|last3=Hubbard|first3=William B.|last4=Saumon|first4=Didier|title=The Interior of Jupiter| url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/39188/1/Stevenson_2004p35.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total mass of heavy elements other than hydrogen and helium in the planet is between 11 and {{earth mass|45}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guillot|first1=Tristan|last2=Gautier|first2=Daniel|last3=Hubbard|first3=William B.|title=New Constraints on the Composition of Jupiter from Galileo Measurements and Interior Models|journal=Icarus|date=December 1997|volume=130|issue=2|pages=534–539|doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5812|arxiv=astro-ph/9707210|bibcode=1997Icar..130..534G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the hydrogen on Jupiter is solid hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Öpik|first1=E.J.|title=Jupiter: Chemical composition, structure, and origin of a giant planet|journal=Icarus|date=January 1962|volume=1|issue=1–6|pages=200–257|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(62)90022-2|bibcode=1962Icar....1..200O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that Jupiter contains a central dense core. If so, the mass of the core is predicted to be no larger than about {{earth mass|12}}. The exact mass of the core is uncertain due to the relatively poor knowledge of the behavior of solid hydrogen at very high pressures.&lt;ref name = "Jupiters Interior"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">The '''law of conservation of complexity''' is an [[adage]] in [[human–computer interaction]] stating that every [[Application software|application]] has an inherent amount of [[Programming complexity|complexity]] that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction. 

This poses the question of who should be exposed to the complexity. For example, should a software developer add complexity to the software code to make the  interaction simpler for the user or should the user deal with a complex interface so that the software code can be simple?
&lt;ref name="designingforinteraction1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designingforinteraction.com/tesler.html |title=Larry Tesler Interview |publisher=Designingforinteraction.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

==Background==
While working for [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]] in the mid-1980s, [[Larry Tesler]] realized that the way users interact with applications was just as important as the application itself.&lt;ref name="designingforinteraction1"/&gt; The book ''Designing for Interaction'' by Dan Saffer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321432061/ "Designing for Interaction" by Dan Saffer at amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; includes an interview with Larry Tesler that describes the law of conservation of complexity. &lt;ref name="designingforinteraction1"/&gt; The interview is popular among [[user experience]] and [[interaction design|interaction designers]].

[[Larry Tesler]] argues that, in most cases, an engineer should spend an extra week reducing the complexity of an application versus making millions of users spend an extra minute using the program because of the extra complexity.&lt;ref name="designingforinteraction1"/&gt; However, [[Bruce Tognazzini]] proposes that people resist reductions to the amount of complexity in their lives.&lt;ref name="tog"&gt;[http://www.asktog.com/columns/011complexity.html The Complexity Paradox - Bruce Tognazinni]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when an application is simplified, users begin attempting more complex tasks.

==Applications==
Possible applications of Tesler's Law:
*Programming
*Vehicles
*Home Appliances
*Workplace Equipment

A '''magnetogravity wave''' is a type of [[plasma wave]]. A magnetogravity wave is an [[sound|acoustic]] [[gravity wave]] which is associated with fluctuations in the background [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Y-Q. |last=Lou |year=1996 |title=Trapped Coronal Magnetogravity Modes |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=272 |issue= 5261|pages=521–523 |jstor=2890096|bibcode=1996Sci...272..521L |doi=10.1126/science.272.5261.521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[gravity wave]] refers to a classical fluid wave, and is completely unrelated to the relativistic [[gravitational wave]].

==Examples ==

Magnetogravity waves are found in the [[corona]] of the Sun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8503">'''Maternal to zygotic transition''' ('''MZT''') is the stage in [[embryonic development]] during which development comes under the exclusive control of the [[Zygote|zygotic]] [[genome]]. This requires both [[Zygote|zygotic]] [[genome]] activation (ZGA) and degradation of maternal products. MZT is often thought to be synonymous with midblastula transition (MBT), but these processes are, in fact, distinct.&lt;ref name="baroux"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Baroux C, Autran D, Gillmor CS, etal |title=The Maternal to Zygotic Transition in Animals and Plants |journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol |volume=73 |pages=89–100 |year=2008 |pmid=19204068 |doi=10.1101/sqb.2008.73.053}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the MBT roughly coincides with ZGA in many [[metazoans]],&lt;ref name="tadros"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=The maternal to zygotic transition: a play in two acts |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=3033–42 |year=2009 |pmid=19700615 |doi=10.1242/dev.033183 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may share some common regulatory features. For example, both processes are proposed to be regulated by the [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]].&lt;ref name="newport"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: I. characterization and timing of cellular changes at the midblastula stage. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=675–86 |year=1982 |pmid=6183003 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90272-0 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard DK, Schubiger G|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Activation of transcription in ''Drosophila'' embryos is a gradual process mediated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio. |journal=Genes Dev |volume=10 |pages=1131–42 |year=1996 |doi=10.1101/gad.10.9.1131 |pmid=8654928 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBT strictly refers to changes in the [[cell cycle]] and [[cell motility]] that occur just prior to [[gastrulation]].&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tadros"/&gt; In the early [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] stages of [[embryogenesis]], rapid divisions occur synchronously and there are no "gap" stages in the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt; During these stages, there is also little to no [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[mRNA]] from the [[zygotic]] [[genome]],&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt; but zygotic transcription is not required for MBT to occur.&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt; Cellular functions during early cleavage are carried out primarily by maternal products – [[protein]]s and [[messenger RNA|mRNAs]] contributed to the egg during [[oogenesis]].

To begin [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[zygotic]] [[genes]], the [[embryo]] must first overcome the [[Gene silencing|silencing]] that has been established. The cause of this [[Gene silencing|silencing]] could be due to several factors: [[chromatin]] [[Histone-Modifying Enzymes|modifications]] leading to repression, lack of adequate [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] [[RNA Polymerase|machinery]], or lack of time in which significant [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] can occur due to the shortened cell cycles.&lt;ref name="schier"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schier AF |title=The Maternal-Zygotic Transition: Death and Birth of RNAs |journal=Science |volume=316 |pages=406–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17446392 |doi=10.1126/science.1140693 |issue=5823 | bibcode = 2007Sci...316..406S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the first method was provided by Newport and Kirschner's experiments showing that [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]] plays a role in activating [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: II. control of the onset of transcription. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=687–96 |year=1982 |pmid= 7139712 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90273-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that a defined amount of repressor is packaged into the egg, and that the exponential amplification of [[DNA]] at each [[cell cycle]] results in titration of the repressor at the appropriate time. Indeed, in ''[[Xenopus]]'' [[embryos]] in which excess [[DNA]] is introduced, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] begins earlier.&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"/&gt; More recently, evidence has been shown that [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a subset of genes in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] is delayed by one [[cell cycle]] in [[haploid]] [[embryos]].&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu X, Li JM, Elemento O, Tavazoie S, Wieschaus EF |title=Coupling of zygotic transcription to mitotic control at the ''Drosophila'' mid-blastula transition. |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=2101–2110 |year=2009 |pmid= 19465600 |doi=10.1242/dev.034421 |issue=12 |pmc=2685728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of repression has also been addressed experimentally. Prioleau et al. show that by introducing [[TATA binding protein]] (TBP) into ''[[Xenopus]]'' oocytes, the block in transcription can be partially overcome.&lt;ref name="prioleau"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prioleau MN, Huet J, Sentenac A, Mechali M |title=Competition between chromatin and transcription complex assembly regulates gene expression during early development. |journal=Cell |volume=77 |pages=439–49 |year=1994 |pmid=8181062  |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90158-9 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that shortened [[cell cycle]]s can cause repression of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is supported by the observation that [[mitosis]] causes transcription to cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shermoen AW, O'Farrell PH|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Progression of the cell cycle through mitosis leads to abortion of nascent transcripts. |journal=Cell |volume=67 |pages=303–10 |year=1991 |pmid=1680567 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90182-X |issue=2 |pmc=2755073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clearing of maternal transcripts==

To eliminate the contribution of maternal [[gene]] products to development, maternally-supplied [[Messenger RNA|mRNAs]] must be degraded in the [[embryo]]. Studies in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] have shown that sequences in the [[3' UTR]] of maternal transcripts mediate their degradation (reviewed by Tadros and Lipshitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Setting the stage for development: mRNA translation and stability during ooccyte maturation and egg activation in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Dev Dyn |volume=232 |pages=593–608 |year=2005 |pmid=15704150 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20297 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These sequences are recognized by regulatory [[proteins]] that cause destabilization or degradation of the transcripts. Recent studies in both [[zebrafish]] and ''[[Xenopus]]'' have found evidence of a role for [[microRNAs]] in degradation of maternal transcripts. In [[zebrafish]], the [[microRNA]] miR-430 is expressed at the onset of [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and targets several hundred [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]] and degradation. Many of these targets are [[genes]] that are expressed maternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giraldez AJ, Mishima Y, Rihel J, Grocock RJ, Van Dongen S, Inoue K, Enright AJ, Schier AF |title=Zebrafish miR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs. |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=75–9 |issue=5770 |year=2006 |pmid=16484454 |doi=10.1126/science.1122689|bibcode = 2006Sci...312...75G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Xenopus]]'', the miR-430 [[ortholog]] miR-427 has been shown to target maternal [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]]. Specifically, miR-427 targets include [[cell cycle]] regulators such as [[Cyclin A1]] and [[Cyclin B2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund E, Liu M, Hartley RS, Sheets MD, Dahlberg JE |title=Deadenylation of maternal mRNAs mediated by miR-427 in ''Xenopus laevis'' embryos. |journal=RNA |volume= 15|pages=2351–63 |pmid=19854872 |year=2009 |doi=10.1261/rna.1882009 |pmc=2779678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">The '''membership function''' of a [[fuzzy set]] is a generalization of the [[indicator function]] in classical [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  In [[fuzzy logic]], it represents the [[degree of truth]] as an extension of [[Valuation (logic)|valuation]]. Degrees of truth are often confused with [[probability|probabilities]], although they are conceptually distinct, because [[fuzzy truth]] represents membership in vaguely defined sets, not likelihood of some event or condition. Membership functions were introduced by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Zadeh]] in the first paper on fuzzy sets (1965). Zadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval (0,1)) operating on the domain of all possible values.

== Definition ==

For any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a membership function on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is any function from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the real unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Membership functions represent [[fuzzy set|fuzzy subsets]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. The membership function which represents a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde A&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mu_A.&lt;/math&gt; For an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the value &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''membership degree'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde A.&lt;/math&gt; The membership degree &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; quantifies the grade of membership of the element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde A.&lt;/math&gt; The value 0 means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of the fuzzy set; the value 1 means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is fully a member of the fuzzy set. The values between 0 and 1 characterize fuzzy members, which belong to the fuzzy set only partially.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Fuzzy crisp.svg]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Membership function of a fuzzy set&lt;/center&gt;

Sometimes,&lt;ref&gt;First in Goguen (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; a more general definition is used, where membership functions take values in an arbitrary fixed algebra or structure &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; {{Explain|date=September 2017}}; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions.
&lt;!-- this is only true for so-called normal fuzzy sets:
The following holds for the functional values of the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mu_{A}(x)\ge0\quad\forall\quad x\in\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in X}[\mu_{A}(x)]=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;--&gt;

== Capacity ==

''See the article on [[Capacity of a set]] for a closely related definition in mathematics.''

One application of membership functions is as capacities in [[decision theory]].

In [[decision theory]], a capacity is defined as a function, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; from '''S''', the set of subsets of some set, into &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is set-wise monotone and is normalized (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\nu(\empty) = 0, \nu(\Omega)=1).&lt;/math&gt;  This is a generalization of the notion of a [[probability measure]], where the [[probability axiom]] of countable additivity is weakened.  A capacity is used as a subjective measure of the likelihood of an event, and the "[[expected value]]" of an outcome given a certain capacity can be found by taking the [[Choquet integral]] over the capacity.

The Metropolis Project's principal decision-making body is an International Steering Committee of representatives from over 40 countries. The Project is managed by a Secretariat with offices in [[Ottawa]], [[Amsterdam]] and in Asia with functions distributed across organizations in Seoul, Manila and Beijing. The Ottawa Secretariat is responsible for establishing the Project’s strategic directions.  Howard Duncan is the Project's Executive Head.

==Metropolis Professional Development==

The Metropolis Project launched in April 2014 a new training program for senior policy-makers, senior managers of settlement agencies, officials of international organizations and the private sector. The programme is intended to provide participants with information, analysis and tools on the management of migration and integration. A pilot training will be offered in June 2014. Metropolis Professional Development has been developed in collaboration with worldwide renowned experts such as [[Graeme Hugo]] (University of Adelaide), Jan Niessen (Migration Policy Group), Imelda Nicolas (Commission on Filipinos Overseas) and Peter Schatzer (IOM) among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://carleton.ca/metropolis/about-us-2/what-we-do/training/|title=Metropolis Professional Development Website}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The Metropolis Project partners with Springer in the publication of an academic journal, the ''Journal of International Migration and Integration'' (''Revue de l'intégration et de la migration internationale'').

'''Multiple realizability''', in the [[philosophy of mind]], is the thesis that the same mental property, state, or event can be implemented by different physical properties, states, or events. The idea has its roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s when a number of philosophers, most prominently [[Hilary Putnam]] (1967, 1988) and [[Jerry Fodor]] (1975), put it forth as an argument against [[reductionism|reductionist]] accounts of the relation between mental and physical kinds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/ "Multiple Realizability" entry at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by John Bickle]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, a theory of mind that includes multiple realizability allows for the existence of [[Chinese room#Strong AI|strong AI]]. The original targets of these arguments were the [[type-identity theory]] and [[eliminative materialism]]. The same arguments from multiple realizability were also used to defend many versions of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], especially ''Machine state functionalism''.

In recent years, however, multiple realizability has been used to attack the very theory that it was originally designed to defend.  As a result, functionalism has fallen out of favor as a dominant theory in the philosophy of mind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The dominant theory ("received view" in the words of [[Ernest Lepore|Lepore]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn|Pylyshyn]]) in modern philosophy of mind is a version of generic [[Physicalism#Non-reductive physicalism|non-reductive physicalism]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and one of its central pillars is the hypothesis of multiple realizability.

Complicating our historical understanding, [[Ricardo Restrepo Echavarria|Restrepo]] noted in 2009 that the thesis of the multiple realizability of the mental was held by [[Alan Turing|Turing]] at least ten years before the usually attributed authors described the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, R. (2009). ''Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.'' Minds and Machines 19(2): 181-197.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Turing expressed the multiple realizability of the mental in the following:

{{quote|The [Babbage Engine's] storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards.

The fact that Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] was to be entirely mechanical will help us rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and the nervous system is also electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. ... If we wish to find such similarities we should look rather for mathematical analogies of function.&lt;ref&gt;Turing, A. (1950). Computing machinery and intelligence. Mind 59. In J. Copeland (Ed.), The essential Turing (pp. 433–460). Oxford: Claredon Press, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Putnam's formulation==
[[Image:Reduktionismus.png|thumb|right|An illustration of multiple realizability. ''M'' stands for mental state and ''P'' stands for physical state. More than one ''P'' can instantiate one ''M'', but not vice versa. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (''M1'' causes ''M2'', etc.)]]
In several papers published in he late 1960s, [[Hilary Putnam]] provides a classic example of the thesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, he argues that, contrary to [[Type physicalism|type-identity theory]], it is not the case that "pain is identical to [[C-fibre]] firing." Pain corresponds to, or is at least correlated with, completely different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms and yet they all experience the same [[Mental representation|mental state]] of "being in pain." Putnam cited numerous examples from all over the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. Is it likely that the brain structures of all mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians and molluscs realize pain, or other mental states, in exactly the same way? Do they even have the same brain structures? Clearly not, if we believe the evidence furnished by comparative [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]]. How can they possibly share the same mental states and properties? The answer must be that these mental kinds are realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then takes his argument a step further, and asks about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially-intelligent robots and silicon-based life forms. Should such hypothetical entities be considered ''a priori'' incapable of experiencing pain just because they do not possess the same neurochemistry as humans? Putnam concludes that type-identity and other reductive theorists make an extremely "ambitious" and "highly implausible" conjecture which can be disproved with just one example of multiple realizability. This argument is referred to as ''the likelihood argument''.

Putnam also formulates a complementary argument based on, what he calls, ''functional isomorphism''. He defines the concept in these terms: "Two systems are functionally isomorphic if ''there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations''." So, in the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the  sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the second. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. This is referred to as the "a priori argument".

Jerry Fodor, Putnam and others also note that, along with being a very effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that ''any'' low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena would be insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which attempts to identify mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the physico-chemical level of microphysics and hence seems to be a more suitable alternative explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves that are multiply realized at the physical level.

==Fodor's generalization==
[[Jaegwon Kim]] takes up the challenge of responding to the problems posed by multiple realizability for reductionist theories by suggesting that the physical realization base of a particular mental state is not a particular physical state but the disjunction of the physical states which realize it. [[Jerry Fodor]] replies to this objection by formulating a generalization of the multiple realizability thesis. According to Fodor, multiple realizability is not just something that occurs "across physical structure-types" but is a phenomenon that could occur even within the same token system (such as an organism). At different times, the same organism may realize type-identical mental kinds in physically different forms. (This thesis was later given some empirical support with the discovery of the relative [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the human brain).

Fodor uses this generalized multiple realizability thesis to argue against reductionism of the mind and of the special sciences. The key to Fodor's argument is that, in his characterization of reductionism, all mental kind predicates in an ideal and completed psychology must correspond with a physical kind predicate in an ideal and completed physics. He suggests taking [[Ernest Nagel]]'s theory of reduction, which insists on the derivability of all terms in the theory to be reduced from terms in the reducing theory and the bridging laws, as the canonical theory of reduction. Given generalized multiple realizability, the physical science part of these psychophysical bridge laws will end up being a (possibly infinite) disjunction of all the terms referring to possible physical realizations of a mental kind. This disjunction cannot be a kind-predicate and therefore the entire statement cannot be a [[Physical law|law of physics]]. The special sciences cannot be reduced to physics in this way, according to Fodor.

In 1988, Hilary Putnam applied the argument from Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability to argue against functionalism itself, including, and above all, his own version of functionalism, [[machine state functionalism]]. Noting that functionalism is essentially a watered-down reductionist or identity theory in which mental kinds are ultimately identified with functional kinds, Putnam argues that mental kinds are probably multiply realizable over functional kinds. The same mental state or property can be implemented or realized by different states of a [[universal Turing machine]].

==Objections and responses==
Early objections to multiple realizability were limited to the narrow, "across structures-type" version. Starting with [[David Kellogg Lewis]], many reductionists argued that it is very common, perhaps the rule, in actual scientific practice to reduce one theory to another by way of "local" and structure-specific reductions. A frequently cited example of this sort of [[intertheoretic reduction]] is the case of temperature from classical thermodynamics. Temperature is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy, but this is only true of ''temperature in a gas''. Temperature in a solid is identical to mean ''maximal'' molecular kinetic energy, because the molecules of a solid are more restricted in their movements. Temperature in a plasma is something of a mystery, since the molecules of a plasma are torn apart. Therefore, temperature, in classical thermodynamics is multiply realized in a wide diversity of microphysical states.

One common defense of multiple realizability argues that any such response which attempts to address the problem of the possibility of ''generalized'' multiple realizability must necessarily be so "local" and "context" specific in nature, referring exclusively to a certain token system of a certain structure-type at a certain time, that its reductions would be incompatible with even a minimally acceptable degree of generality in scientific theorizing. This problem is well illustrated by the controversial question of the plasticity of the human brain. Simply put, neural plasticity consists in the fact that different areas of the brain can, and often do, take over the functions of other parts that have been damaged as the result of traumatic injury, pathology, natural biological development and other processes. Any psychology which is narrowed down sufficiently to handle this level of multiple realizability will almost certainly not be general enough to capture the generalizations needed to explain only human psychology.

Recent reductionists (including [[William Bechtel|Bechtel]] and [[Jennifer Mundale|Mundale]]) reply that this is not empirically plausible. In order to conduct research and carry out experiments in the neurosciences, some universal consistencies in brain structures must either exist or be assumed to exist. The similarity (produced by [[homology (biology)|homology]] or convergent evolution) of brain structures allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability (especially the generalized form) were an empirical fact, then results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful or useful when generalized to explain the behavior or characteristics of another species (or organism of the same species; or in the generalized form, even the same organism).

[[Sungsu Kim]] has recently responded to this objection by pointing to the important distinction between homology of brain structures and [[homoplasy]]. Homologies are any characteristics of physiology, morphology, behavior or psychology that are shared by two or more species and that are inherited from a common ancestor. Homoplasies are similar or identical characteristics that are shared by two or more species but that are not inherited from a common ancestor, having evolved independently. The feet of ducks and platypuses are a good example of homoplasy, while the hands of humans and chimps are a good example of homology. The fact that brain structures are homologous provides no evidence either for or against multiple realizability. The only way to empirically test the thesis of multiple realizability would be to examine brain structures and determine whether some homoplasious "psychological processes or functions might be 'constructed' from different material" and supported by different brain structures just as the flight capacities of bats and birds emerge from different morphophysiologies. The emergence of similar behavioral outputs or psychological functions brought about by similar or identical brain structures in [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] evolutionary lineages would provide some evidence against multiple realizability, since it is highly improbable that this would happen, if not for constraints on the type of physical system that can realize mental phenomena. This, however, would not completely refute the possibility of realizibility of mental states in radically different physical systems such as non-carbon based life forms or machines.

==Kim's argument==
[[Jaegwon Kim]] has recently argued against non-reductive physicalism on the grounds that it violates the [[Causal closure|causal closure of the physical]]. The rough idea is that physics provides a full explanation of physical events. If mental properties are causally efficacious, they must either be identical to physical properties, or there must be widespread overdetermination. The latter is often held to be either unlikely or even impossible on conceptual grounds. If Kim is right, then the options seem to be either reduction or elimination.

==Medium independence==
In his mechanistic account of computation, [[Gualtiero Piccinini]] appeals to the notion of medium independence.  To understand this, we must first differentiate three related qualities:  variable realizability, multiple realizability, and medium independence.  A property is said to be variably realizable if it can be instantiated by different realizers.  For a property to be multiply realizable, the property must be able to be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms.  For example, consider a winged corkscrew and a waiter's corkscrew.  Both have the property of removing corks and do so through the same mechanism - a screw and pull mechanism.  Because the mechanism is fundamentally unchanged, the property is variably realizable.  Next, consider the property of trapping mice as instantiated by mousetraps.  Consider the classic spring mousetrap and the glue mousetrap.  Both instantiate the same property, the ability to trap mice, but they do so through different mechanisms.  As such, the property is multiply realizable.  Medium independence has an criteria over and above those of multiple realizablity.  A property is medium independent if it can be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms and if the inputs and outputs of the mechanisms are also multiply realizable.  As you can see, a mousetrap is not medium independent; it must take a mouse as an input.  A computer, though, is medium independent.  A computer can be constructed from different parts assembled into different mechanisms and, importantly, can take different types of inputs and outputs.  In typical digital computers, the inputs and outputs are voltages, but in quantum computers, the inputs and outputs would be different. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1909">The '''Okinawa Centenarian Study''' is a study of the [[elderly]] people of [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]]. The study, funded by Japan's ministry of health, is the largest of its kind ever carried out. Over the years, the scientists involved have had access to more than 600 Okinawan centenarians.&lt;ref name="Want to live to be 100"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jun/07/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing Want to live to be 100?] The Guardian newspaper. Published June 7, 2001. Accessed February 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elderly of Okinawa enjoy what may be the longest life-expectancy in the world,
and are also known for enjoying the relatively good health while doing so.
The three leading killers in the West—[[coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]], stroke, and cancer—occur in Okinawans with the lowest frequency in the world.&lt;ref name="Stats of Okinawan health"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|author2=Willcox, Tamaki|title=First Autopsy Study of an Okinawan Centenarian: Absence of Many Age-Related Diseases|journal=Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences|year=2004|volume=59A|issue=11|pages=1195–1199|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the study is to find out why this is the case.

Compared to Westerners, the islanders age slowly and are about 80% less likely to get heart disease. They're also a quarter less likely to get breast or prostate cancer. In addition, they have half the risk of getting colon cancer and are less likely than Westerners to get dementia. On average they spend 97% of their lives free of any disabilities.&lt;ref name="Want to live to be 100"/&gt;

'''Oliva Sabuco de Nantes Barrera''' (1562–1622) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] writer in [[Holistic health|holistic medical philosophy]] in the late 16th – early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1991, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interested in the interaction between the physical and psychological phenomena; therefore she wrote a collection of medical and psychological treatises that target human nature and explain the effects of emotions on the body and soul.&lt;ref name = Waithe265&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; She analyzed theoretical claims of ancient philosophers and wrote an early theory of what is now considered [[Applied Psychology|applied psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

She was born in [[Alcaraz]], Spain in 1562 and was baptized in the Holy Trinity church on December 2 of that same year.&lt;ref name = Cannon&gt;Cannon 1916, p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was Francisca de Cozar and her father was Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; By 1580, at the age of 18, she was married to Don Acacio de Buedo.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; Although not much is known about her formal education it is evident that Oliva Sabuco was taught medicine by her father.&lt;ref&gt;Kersey 1989, p. 1143.&lt;/ref&gt; She was well acquainted with classical and contemporary philosophy and was knowledgeable about medical theory.&lt;ref name=Waithe268&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; By age 25 she already published a novel far ahead of her time.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Mind–body coexistence===
Sabuco combined ancient Greek and Christian philosophies, along with [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] views in order to explain how the mind and body interact in a [[holistic]] manner.&lt;ref name=WVZ15&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed human nature to be a single concept, where the rational soul and spiritual soul must co-occur for a human being to exist.&lt;ref name=WVZ15/&gt; A human being would be considered a corpse with no potential for living when it lacked either of the two souls.&lt;ref name=WVZ15/&gt; Sabuco agreed with [[Aristotle|Atristotle's]] vision of form and matter in relation to the body: they both believed the interaction between the mind and body was the formal organization of a whole living human being.&lt;ref name=WVZ16&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory differed in the sense that the human being could not exist until the divine soul/mind coexisted with the body/matter.&lt;ref name=WVZ16/&gt;

Her approach to the mind–body interaction mirrored that of [[Plato|Plato’s]].  The mind was in charge of moral judgments and reasons which caused the body to react in certain ways.  Therefore, the body carried out the moral judgments that were processed. Sabuco placed emphasis on self-knowledge and the capacity of the mind to exercise free will.  Self-knowledge and ethical decisions allowed hope, health, strength and a natural life span to be placed on the human body while free will directed the passions and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmony and a healthy state===
According to Sabuco, the soul was divided into three parts: the sensitive, the biological, and the intellectual soul, all which would be in a harmonic balance with one another.&lt;ref name=WVZ17&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between the four humors, hot, cold, wet, and dry must also be in harmony in order for the human organ system to be in a healthy state.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Sabuco used a temperature-humidity schema, derived from [[Hippocrates]], to evaluate illnesses and individuals’ state of health.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Although her ideas originated from Hippocrates’s [[humorism|four bodily humors]], Sabuco denied the importance of his theory and insisted the focus lie on the severity of temperature and humidity.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; For example, illnesses, disabilities and premature death were results of disharmony among the three parts of the soul or the temperature-humidity schema.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Sabuco also coined the term chilo, which was a white liquid energizing force that traveled through a complex network of anatomical channels from one organ system to another.&lt;ref name=WVZ18&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilo maintained the proper temperature and humidity within the body; nonetheless, an imbalance could lead to negative states of health.&lt;ref name=WVZ18/&gt;  The purpose of chilo was to communicate movement to the bodily organs and orient them to carry out the goal meant to be accomplished.&lt;ref name=Waithe264&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
Sabuco’s theory of moral philosophy incorporated traditional views of virtue ethics. Good and evil were intertwined in the world and could banish each other.&lt;ref name=WVZ27&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory stated how something good could be present in evil and something evil could be present in good.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; There was never such a concept as pure evil or pure good. Within her theory of human nature only two evils existed, avoidable diseases and premature aging.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; Sabuco promoted moderation and temperance to control emotions and passions; her theory originated from Plato’s concept of [[sophrosyne]], where self-understanding is used to obtain wisdom and virtue.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; However, she referenced temperance as the most important virtue that was obtained through self-knowledge. Temperance and wisdom were then labeled as the answers to evil because they sustained human life and provided peace, happiness, and content between emotions and the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===

The second part of her work described astronomical and geological events and how they support the theory of human nature. It was important to learn how the [[macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]] functions because humans were a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] within the board world.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; Understanding how the world came to be would teach humans how to live in that world.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; A person's condition, whether improving or declining was related to cosmology.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; Such topics included the moon, the magnitude of the Earth and its atmosphere, solar and lunar eclipses and the magnitude of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's life cycle would improve or decline just like a moon's cycle would be waxing or waning.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Within macrocosm, the moon was defined as the brain of the world which provided moisture and growth to its waters.&lt;ref name=Pomata49&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Microcosm, on the other hand, described the sun as the heart of the world which gave warmth and life to the world.&lt;ref name=Pomata49/&gt; The emphasis was placed on the brain, making it more significant than the heart, as the moon was more vital than the sun.&lt;ref name=Pomata49/&gt;

===World improvements: judicial, legislative, and social thoughts===

Sabuco introduced smaller systems of reformation into her idea of human nature. Sabuco advocated for the creation of legislative, judicial and social reforms in the welfare rights of the powerless, people such as peasants, workers and householders.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The powerless were the ones whose health was severely impacted the most by the misery and despair of everyday life.&lt;ref name=Pomata6&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess and greed should be avoided because they were bad for the social and individual body.&lt;ref name=Pomata6/&gt;

She argued for a legal reformation of judicial laws, doctrines of appeals and better protection under the law. She reasoned that the individuals who created the laws would be the only ones who would comprehend them.&lt;ref name=WVZ29&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the laws would not be applicable or fair to lower socioeconomic classes who did not partake in the creation of them. Laws must be clear, written in simple language and precise so proper justice could be granted to the poor.&lt;ref name=WVZ29/&gt; Sabuco also argued against juridical doctrines of appeal to authority figures of Roman law.&lt;ref name=WVZ30&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Authoritarian power was passed down through generations and individuals' verdicts had varying interpretations from previous generations of authorities who lacked knowledge about the present case.&lt;ref name=WVZ30/&gt;  As a result, she believed protection under the law was unequal for most of the public and most did not receive proper justice.&lt;ref name=WVZ30/&gt;

Legislative reformation should include protection for farmers and peasants because their labor and production was essential in the survival of others within the nation. She was a strong proponent of preventing the authority from confiscating land, livestock, and crops.&lt;ref name=WVZ31&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabuco criticized university policies and the objectives of the education system. She mentioned the lack of proper criteria for an individual regarding admissions and recommended examiners evaluate potential candidates' abilities when granting admission. She also denounced the importance of charging students tuition because students were admitted who could afford tuition but lacked the proper aptitude to succeed.&lt;ref name=WVZ31/&gt;

===Physical medicine and remedies===

Sabuco disagreed with the traditional medical theory and thought its failure to control medicine was due to people's ignorance on the  impact of emotions on physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions such as anger, sadness, love, excessive joy, hatred, shame and distrust caused imbalances in the bodily humors which squeezed the humor and humidity out of the brain where the soul was located.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The only true appropriate medicine would comfort the brain and be in accordance between the body and the soul.&lt;ref name=WVZ24&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Words and deeds that generated joy and hope and taking care of the stomach were the three pillars of health that could comfort the brain.&lt;ref name=WVZ24/&gt; If optimism, contented happiness and abdominal temperature were left unattended they could lead to sorrow, discontent and melancholy.&lt;ref name=Pomata6&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Another general remedy mentioned was the diversion of humor through bodily openings so it would not reach internal organs.&lt;ref name=Pomata6/&gt;

==Treatise==

The book, published in [[Madrid]] in 1587, was called ''Nueva Filosofia de la Naturaleza del Hombre (New Philosophy of Human Nature)''.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10&gt;Waithe 2007, p. 1, 3, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of seven separately titled treatises.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt; The first five, ''Knowledge of One’s Self'',''Composition of the World as It Is'', ''Things That Will Improve This World and Its Nations'', ''Treatments and Remedies of Proper Medicine'', and ''Proper Medicine Derived from Human Nature''' are written in the [[Castilian language]].&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;  While the last two, ''Brief Exposition on Human Nature: The Foundations of the Art of Medicine'', and ''Proper Philosophy of the Nature of Composite Things, of Humans, and of the World, Unknown to the Ancients'', are written in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;  This book, in its entirety, was dedicated to [[Philip II of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's,'' p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first treatise within Sabuco’s most famous book, ''New Philosophy of Human Nature'', introduces a discussion between three peasants, whom she identified as shepherds and who critique the views of others.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; These three shepherds continue as the main characters throughout the remaining six treatises and their discussions cover various topics of human nature. The identity of her characters represents the significance of remaining in close contact with nature and staying isolated from society so societal views will not sully the mind.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; She purposely included peasants as characters in order to demonstrate how philosophy and medicine are relevant regardless of social class.&lt;ref name=Waithe3&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Sabuco believed her theory should be relevant to simple folks and applicable to their lives.&lt;ref name=Waithe3/&gt; The  treatises emphasized the universe by describing the theory on mutual interdependence of the soul, body, and cosmos.&lt;ref name =Waithe265/&gt;
  
In the pages of her treatise she explored many ideas amongst which are the comparison of a human body to an upside down tree.&lt;ref name=G240&gt;''Gentleman's,'' p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the brain, like in the root of a tree, that all diseases begin and it is possible to cure them through various methods amongst which are words of cheerfulness, sound thought, and even to the hearing of music.&lt;ref name=G240/&gt; The process of using wise words against violent emotions such as anger, she called "Rhetorical Insinuation" because it explored the idea of being able to persuade the will through words.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn 1998, p. 875.&lt;/ref&gt; She explored how emotions have an effect on the human body and how one can control their effects by focusing on the chief organ of the body, the brain.&lt;ref name=Winters&gt;Winters 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Father Feyjoo, much of the research she did contributed to the ability of physicians following her to develop some of the first theories around nervous diseases.&lt;ref name=G240/&gt;

Going back to the idea of the brain as King, she wrote how during sleep the brain was feed all its necessary nutrients, which have been, throughout the day, collected in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Barona&gt;Barona 1993, p. 176, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the nutrients were taken to the brain and nervous fluid was created, it was allocated throughout the body by a fluid aside from red blood.&lt;ref name=Barona /&gt; Some have postulated that she was referring to a concept similar to white blood cells when she wrote this for she makes mention of a fluid white in color nourishing the body with information.&lt;ref name=Winters /&gt;

==Fame and influence==

Her work has sometimes been compared with [[Descartes]]' ''[[Passions of the Soul|The Passion of the Soul]]'', for like him she imagined the seat of the soul to be in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Keitt 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; We know that she was famous in her day because in 1604, while she was still alive, Franciscio Lopez de Uveda, a physician and poet from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], expressed that a character he was working on would out fame people like Oliva Sabuco and [[Don Quixote]], thus implying her name to be one associated with fame.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt; In addition to this, the famous French physician Charles le Pois cited Sabuco’s influence on his own views regarding diseases such as hysteria.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;

==Summary==

Without definitively solving the mind body problem, Sabuco moves philosophy a step in that direction by providing both a new chemical explanation, with white fluid as a vehicle of mind body interaction, and an explanation of the role of emotions on physical health.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;

==Later life==
Credit for her work was sometimes given to her father, Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez, because of a powerful letter written by him claiming the work as his own.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; His letter and a promissory note written by Sabuco's husband and brother were implemented a year following the publication of the book.&lt;ref name=Waithe264/&gt; The letter claimed Don Miguel Sabuco as the true author of ''New Philosophy of Human Nature'' and an explanation stating that her name was included in an attempt to honor her but she had no legal interest in the volume nor authority over it.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholarship has defended her case, claiming that she was the writer. Because of the nature of her material, she incurred the attention of the [[Spanish Inquisition|inquisitors]] and had all her books burned.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1995, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; She lived out her days in the convent of Dominican nuns in Alcaraz and took on a monastic habit.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; There, she eventually died around the year 1622.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt;

==Honours==
A crater on the [[planet Venus]] was named ''Barrera'' in her honour, see [[List of craters on Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/614?__fsk=-450930971 Barrera] Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU). Accessed March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Several strains of ''Pelagibacter ubique'' have been cultured thanks to improved isolation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stingl | first1 = U. | last2 = Tripp | first2 = H.

The factors that regulate SAR11 populations are still largely unknown. They have sensors for [[nitrogen]], [[phosphate]], and [[iron]] limitation, and a very unusual requirement for reduced [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref name=tripp1&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. James Tripp |display-authors=4 |author2=Joshua B. Kitner |author3=Michael S. Schwalbach |author4=John W. H. Dacey |author5=Larry J. Wilhelm |author6=Stephen J.

A population of ''P. ubique'' cells can double every 29 hours, which is fairly slow, but they can replicate under low nutrient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giovannoni Stephen J. | author2 = Stingl Ulrich | date = 2005 | title = Molecular diversity and ecology of microbial plankton | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7057| pages = 343–348 | doi=10.1038/nature04158 | pmid=16163344| bibcode = 2005Natur.437..343G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P. ubique'' can be grown on a defined, artificial medium with additions of reduced sulfur, glycine, pyruvate and vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carini, Paul | display-authors = etal | date = 2012 | title = Nutrient requirements for growth of the extreme oligotroph '"Candidatus" Pelagibacter ubique' HTCC1062 on a defined medium | url = http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ismej2012122a.html | journal = ISME | volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 592–602| doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.122| pmid = 23096402 | pmc = 3578571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genome==
The genome of ''P. ubique'' strain HTCC1062 was completely sequenced in 2005 showing that ''P. ubique'' has the smallest [[genome]] (1,308,759 bp) of any free living organism&lt;ref name="genome"/&gt; encoding only 1,354 open reading frames (1,389 genes total).&lt;ref name=Pelagibacter_genome&gt;{{cite web|title = Pelagibacter ubique genome| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/491|publisher=NCBI|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only species with smaller genomes are intracellular symbionts and parasites, such as ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' or ''[[Nanoarchaeum equitans]]''&lt;ref name=genome/&gt; It has the smallest number of open reading frames of any free living organism, and the shortest intergenic spacers, but it still has [[metabolic pathways]] for all 20 [[amino acids]] and most co-factors.&lt;ref name="genome" /&gt; Its genome has been streamlined. This streamlining concept is important because it reduces the amount of energy required for cell replication.&lt;ref name="Pelagibacter ubique Genome" /&gt; ''P. ubique'' saves energy by using the [[base pairs]] A and T (≈70.3% of all base pairs) because they contain less [[nitrogen]], a resource that is hard for organisms to acquire.&lt;ref name="Pelagibacter ubique Genome" /&gt;

[[Non-coding RNA]]s have been identified in ''P. ubique'' through a [[bioinformatics]] screen of the published genome and metagenomic data.

==Name==
{{see also|Bacterial taxonomy}}
The name of the genus (''Pelagibacter'') stems from the Latin masculine noun ''[[wikt:en:pelagus|pelagus]]'' ("sea") combined with the suffix [[-bacter]] (rod, bacterium), to mean "bacterium of the sea". The connecting vowel is an "i" and not an "o", as the first term is the Latin "pelagus" and not the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] original ''πέλαγος (pelagos)'' (the word ''pelagus'' is a Greek word used in Latin poetry, it is a 2nd declension noun with a Greek-like irregular nominative plural ''pelagē'' and not ''pelagi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pelagus entry in Perseus Digital Library|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=pelagus&amp;la=la#lexicon|website=Perseus Digital Library Project |author=Gregory R.

'''Personnel selection''' is the methodical process used to hire (or, less commonly, [[promotion (rank)|promote]]) individuals. Although the term can apply to all aspects of the process ([[recruitment]], selection, hiring, acculturation, etc.) the most common meaning focuses on the selection of workers. In this respect, selected prospects are separated from rejected applicants with the intention of choosing the person who will be the most successful and make the most valuable contributions to the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky&gt;Muchinsky, P. (2012). ''Psychology Applied to Work'', (10th ed.). Summerfield, N
klu
C: Hypergraphic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effect on the group is discerned when the selected accomplish their desired impact to the group, through achievement or tenure. The procedure of selection takes after strategy to gather data around a person so as to figure out whether that individual ought to be utilized. The strategies used must be in compliance with the various laws in respect to work force selection.

==Overview==
The professional standards of [[industrial psychology|industrial-organizational psychologists]] (I-O psychologists) require that any selection system be based on a [[job analysis]] to ensure that the selection criteria are job-related. The requirements for a selection system are characteristics known as KSAOs – knowledge, skills, ability, and other characteristics. US law also recognizes ''[[bona fide occupational qualifications]]'' (BFOQs), which are requirements for a job which would be considered discriminatory if not necessary – such as only employing men as wardens of maximum-security male prisons, enforcing a mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, or a religious college only employing professors of its religion to teach its theology.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates and involve both the newly hired and those individuals who can be promoted from within the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

In this respect, selection of personnel has "validity" if an unmistakable relationship can be shown between the system itself and the employment for which the people are ultimately being chosen for. In this way, a vital piece of selection is Job Analysis. An analysis is typically conducted before, and regularly apart of, the improvement in determination systems. Then again, a selection method may be deemed valid after it has already been executed by directing follow up job analysis and demonstrating the relationship between the selection process and the respective job.&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

The procedure of personnel selection includes gathering data about the potential candidates with the end goal of deciding suitability and sustainability for the employment in that particular job. This data is gathered utilizing one or more determination devices or strategies classified as such:&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt; 
* Interviews
* Personality Tests
* Biographical Data
* Cognitive Ability Tests
* Physical Ability Tests
* Work Samples
Development and implementation of such screening methods is sometimes done by human resources departments; larger organizations hire consultants or firms that specialize in developing personnel selection systems. I-O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance, evidence that bears on the validity of selection tools. These procedures are usually validated (shown to be job relevant), using one or more of the following types of [[validity (statistics)|validity]]: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]].&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

==History and development==
[[Imperial examination|Chinese civil servant exams]], established in AD 605, may be the first documented "modern" selection tests, and have influenced subsequent examination systems.&lt;ref&gt;

As a scientific and scholarly field, personnel selection owes much to [[psychometric]] theory and the art of integrating selection systems falls to [[human resources|human resource professionals]].

In the [[United States of America]], members of the [http://www.siop.org Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)] conduct much of the research on selection. Primary research topics include:

* the practicality, reliability, validity, and utility of various forms of selection measures
* methods for demonstrating return on investment for selection systems
* assessing fairness and making selection systems as fair as possible
* legal issues&amp;mdash;such as [[disparate treatment]] and [[disparate impact]]&amp;mdash;and overall compliance with laws
* the generalizability of validity across different work contexts
* alternative methods of demonstrating validity, such as synthetic validity&lt;ref&gt;Steel, P. (2006).

== Validity and reliability ==
=== Validity of interviews ===
The validity of interviews describes how useful interviews are in predicting job performance. In one of the most comprehensive meta-analytic summary to date by Weisner and Cronshaw (1988). The authors investigated interview validity as a function of interview format (individual vs board) and degree of structure( structure vs unstructured). Results of this study showed that structured interviews yielded much higher mean corrected validities than unstructured interviews (0.63 vs 0.20), and  structured board interviews using consensus ratings had the highest corrected validity (0.64).

In&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews|last = McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's|first = |date = 1994|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology Vol.79. No. 4, 599 – 616.|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's  Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews (1994) paper, the authors go a step further and  include an examination of the validity of three different types of interview content(situational, job-related, and psychological).Their goal was to explore the possibility that validity is a function of the type of content collected.

They define the three kinds of content as follows – situational content was described as interview questions that get information on how the interviewee would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether the interviewee would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess the interviewee's past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess the interviewee's personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of all previous studies on the validity of interviews across the three types of  content mentioned above. Their results show that for job-performance criteria, situational interviews yield higher mean validity(0.50) than do job-related interviews(0.39) which yield a higher mean validity than do psychology interviews(0.29). This means that when the interview is used to predict job performance, it is best to conduct situational interviews rather than job-related or psychological interviews. On the other hand, when interviews are used to predict an applicant's training performance, the mean validity of job-related interviews(0.36) is somewhat lower than the mean validity of psychological interviews(0.40).

Going beyond the content of the interview, the authors' analysis of interview validity was extended to include an assessment of how the interview was conducted. Here, two questions emerged – Are structured interviews more valid than unstructured interviews ? and are board interviews( with more than one interviewer) more valid than individual interviews.

Their answer  to the first question – Are structured interviews more valid unstructured interviews was that structured interviews, regardless of content, is more valid(0.44) than unstructured interviews(0.33) in predicting job performance criteria. However, when training performance is the criteria, the validity of structured and unstructured interviews are similar (0.34 and 0.36).

As for the validity of board interviews versus individual interviews, the researchers conducted another meta-analyses comparing the validity of board interviews and individual interviews for job performance criteria. The results show that individual interviews are more valid than board interviews( 0.43 vs 0.32). This is true regardless of whether the individual interview is structured or unstructured.

When exploring the variance in interview validity between job performance, training performance, and tenure criteria, the researchers found that the interviews are similar in predictive accuracy for job-performance and training performance( 0.37 vs 0.36). But less predictive for tenure (0.20).

=== Validity of cognitive ability and personality tests ===
Based on meta-analysis results, cognitive ability tests appear to be among the most valid of all psychological tests and are valid for most occupations. However, these tests tend to do better at predicting training criteria than long term job performance. Cognitive ability tests in general provide the benefit of being generalizable. Hence they can be used across organizations and jobs and have been shown to produce large economic gains for companies that use them (Gatewood &amp; Feild, 1998; Heneman et al., 2000).

But despite the high validity of cognitive testing, it is less frequently used as selection tools. One main reason is that cognitive ability testing has been demonstrated to produce adverse impact. In general, groups including Hispanics and African-Americans score lower than the general population while other groups including Asian – Americans score higher (Heneman et al., 2000; Lubenski, 1995). The legal issues with cognitive ability testing were amplified by the supreme court's ruling in the famous 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power case. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that when a selection test produces adverse impact against protected group members the company must be able to defend it by showing that use of the test is a "business necessity" for the operation of the business. The courts have held narrow interpretations of business necessity that require companies to show that no other acceptable selection alternative exists (Sovereign, 1999). As a result, many companies abandoned cognitive ability testing ( Steven L. Thomas &amp;Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

While the utility of cognitive ability testing in selection has been broadly accepted, the utility of personality testing, until relatively recently, has not. Historically, research documenting the low predictive validity and the potential for invasion of privacy based on item content has made its application as selection instruments questionable (Hogan, Hogan, &amp; Roberts, 1996).

But due to the legal challenges associated with cognitive ability, interest in personality instruments has recently been revived (Schmidt, Ones, &amp; Hunter, 1992). Some have suggested that pairing personality testing with cognitive ability testing may be one means to enhance validity while reducing adverse impact (Ryan, Ployhart, &amp; Friedel, 1998). Because it is very likely that some aspects of personality enhance individual ability to apply intellectual capacity while other personality traits limit its application (Kaufman &amp; Lichtenberger, 1999). Hence, adding a personality to an ability test should enhance validity while reducing the adverse impact of a selection system.

Recent research studies prove this assumption to be false, by showing that the addition of a predictor producing smaller group differences (i.e., personality test) to a predictor producing higher group differences (i.e., cognitive ability test) does not reduce the potential for adverse impact to the degree that is often expected (Bobko, Roth, &amp; Potosky, 1999; Schmitt, Rogers, Chan, Sheppard, &amp; Jennings, 1997).

Although the use of personality tests with measures of cognitive ability may not have the desired effects on reducing adverse impact, it appears that the addition of personality measures to measures of cognitive ability as a composite predictor results in significant incremental validity (Bobko et al., 1999; Schmitt et al.,1997). These studies found that the validity of predictor composites was highest when alternative predictors were used in combination with cognitive ability. Though this combination of predictors resulted in the highest predictive validity, the inclusion of cognitive ability with these alternative predictors increased the potential for adverse impact (Steven L. Thomas &amp; Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

In summary, cognitive ability testing by itself has been shown to have high levels of validity, but comes with issues relating to adverse impact. Personality tests, on the other hand, have historically been proven to have low validity due to the lack of a common understanding on what constitutes personality, and the non-standardized measures available. But a growing number of research  studies show that the best way for organizations to achieve close to optimal validity and job performance prediction, is to create a predictor composite that includes a measure of cognitive ability and an additional measure such as a personality test.

==Predictor validity and selection ratio==
Two major factors determine the quality of newly hired employees, [[predictive validity|predictor validity]] and [[selection ratio]].&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; The predictor cutoff is a test score differentiating those passing a selection measure from those who did not. People above this score are hired or are further considered while those below it are not.

The selection ratio (SR), on the other hand is the number of job openings [[statistical sample|''n'']] divided by the number of job applicants ''N''. This value will range between 0 and 1, reflecting the selectivity of the organization's hiring practices. When the SR is equal to 1 or greater, the use of any selection device has little meaning, but this is not often the case as there are usually more applicants than job openings. Finally, the [[base rate]] is defined by the percentage of employees thought to be performing their jobs satisfactorily following measurement.

==Selection decisions==
Tests designed to determine an individual's aptitude for a particular position, company or industry may be referred to as personnel assessment tools. Such tests can aid those charged with hiring personnel in both selecting individuals for hire and in placing new hires in the appropriate positions. They vary in the measurements they use and level of standardization they employ, though all are subject to error.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. (1999) "Chapter 1: Personnel Assessment." pp. 1-7 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych304-3.1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictors for selection always have less than perfect validity and scatter plots, as well as other forecasting methods such as judgmental bootstrapping, and index models can help us to refine a prediction model as well as identify any mistakes.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=others|date=2012|title=Predicting job performance: The moneyball factor|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/254416540_Predicting_Job_Performance_The_Moneyball_Factor/links/0046352826eef7b0cc000000.pdf|journal=Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting|volume=25|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion cutoff is the point separating successful and unsuccessful performers according to a standard set by the hiring organization. [[Type I and type II errors|True positives]] are applied those thought to succeed on the job as a result of having passed the selection test and who have, in fact, performed satisfactorily. True negatives describe those who were correctly rejected based on the measure because they would not be successful employees.

False negatives occur when people are rejected as a result of selection test failure, but would have performed well on the job anyway.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Finally, false positives are applied to individuals who are selected for having passed the selection measure, but do not make successful employees. These selection errors can be minimized by increasing the validity of the predictor test.

Standards for determination of the cutoff score vary widely, but should be set to be consistent with the expectations of the relevant job.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Adjusting the cutoff in either direction will automatically increase the error in the other. Thus, it is important to determine which type of error is more harmful on a case-by-case basis.

Banding is another method for setting cutoff values.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campion, M. A., Outtz, J. L., Zedeck, S., Schmidt, F. L., Kehoe, J. F., Murphy, K. R., &amp; Guion, R. M. (2001). [http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/campionm/Controversy_Score_Banding.pdf The controversy over score banding in personnel selection: Answers to 10 key questions]. ''Personnel Psychology'', '''54(1)''', 149–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Some differences in test scores are ignored as applicants whose scores fall with in the same band (or, range) are selected not on the basis of individual scores, but of another factor spas to reduce adverse impact. The width of the band itself is a function of test reliability, the two being negatively correlated. Banding allows employers to ignore test scores altogether by using random selection, and many have criticized the technique for this reason.

==Predicting job performance==
A meta-analysis of selection methods in personnel psychology found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of [[job performance]] and training performance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F. L. &amp; Hunter, J. E. (1998).

''Psychological Bulletin'', '''124(2)''', 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding interview procedures, there are data which put into question these tools for selecting employees.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, M. A., Whetzel, D. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Maurer, S. D. (1994).[http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/McDaniel_Whetzel_Schmidt_Maurer%20(1994).pdf The validity of employment interview: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79(4)''', 599-616.&lt;/ref&gt; While the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often entail lower costs. Unstructured interviews are commonly used, but structured interviews tend to yield better outcomes and are considered a better practice.&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I. (2010).

Research'', '''12''', 121-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interview structure is defined as "the reduction in procedural variance across applicants, which can translate into the degree of discretion that an interviewer is allowed in conducting the interview."&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I., &amp; Hunter, W. Jr. (1994). [http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/PSYC%20651/Huffcutt%20&amp;%20Arthur%20(1994)%20Interview.pdf Hunter &amp; Hunter revisited: Interview validity for entry-level jobs]. '' Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79''', 184-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure in an interview can be compared to a typical paper and pencil test: we would not think it was fair if every test taker were given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently. Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; thus, a structured interview attempts to standardize this popular selection tool.

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have also been conducted to look at the relationship between [[organizational citizenship behavior| organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)]] and organizational performance and success.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Podsakoff&gt;Podsakoff, N. P., Whiting, S. W., Podsakoff, P. M., &amp; Mishra, P. (2011). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=apl-96-2-310&amp;site=ehost-live Effects of organizational citizenship behaviors on selection decisions in employment interviews]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''96(2)''', 310-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Job candidates exhibiting higher levels of helping, voice, and loyalty behaviors were generally rated as more confident, received higher salaries, and received higher salary recommendations than job candidates exhibiting these behaviors to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name=Podsakoff/&gt; This was found to be true even candidate responses regarding task performance were taken into account. Finally, content analyses of open-ended question responses indicated selection decisions were highly sensitive to candidates with low expression of voice and helping behaviors.

Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the composition and structure of any [[organic compound]], making it a powerful tool for the definitive identification and characterisation of [[biomarker]]s, and providing direct information of potential [[biosignature]]s of past microbial [[life on Mars]].&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt;  This instrument will also provide general mineralogical information for igneous, metamorphous, and sedimentary processes.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt;

RST will also correlate its spectral information with other spectroscopic and imaging instruments such as the Infrared Spectrometer and [[MicrOmega-IR]].&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt; This will be the first Raman analyser to be deployed for a planetary exploration.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The first version for the rover was presented by Fernando Rull-Perez and Sylvestre Maurice in 2003.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The RLS is being developed by a European consortium integrated by Spanish, French, German and UK partners.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The [[Principal Investigator]] is Fernando Rull-Perez, from ''Centro de Astrobiología'' in Spain.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt; The co-investigator is from  Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées (LAOMP), France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2130|title=The ExoMars Rover Instrument Suite|website=exploration.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three major components are the ''Spectrometer Unit'', the ''Control and Excitation Unit'' (includes the power converters), and ''Optical head''.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2011/pdf/2400.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt;

==Principle and operation==

The RLS instrument provides a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It is used to analyse the [[vibrational mode]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of a substance either in the solid, liquid or gas state.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The technique relies on [[Raman scattering]] of a photon by molecules which are excited to higher vibrational or rotational energy levels. In more detail, it will collect and analyse the scattered light emitted by a [[laser]] on a crushed Mars rock sample; the [[Spectral density|spectrum]] observed (number of peaks, position and relative intensities) is determined by the molecular structure and composition of a compound, enabling the identification and characterisation of the compounds in the sample.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt; 

Some advantages of RLS over other analysers are that it is nondestructive, analysis is completed in a fraction of a second, and the spectral bands provide definitive composition of the material.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; RLS measurements will be conducted on the resulting crushed sample powder and it will be a useful tool for flagging the presence of organic molecules for further [[biomarker]] search by the [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer|MOMA]] analyser.

The [[Processor (computing)|processor]] board carries out several key functions for the Raman spectrometer control, spectral operation, data storage, and communications with the rover. The complete instrument has a mass of 2.4 kg (5.29 lb) and consumes about 30 [[Watt|W]] while operating.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morala&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2449.pdf Raman Laser pectrometer for 2020 ExoMars Mission.

A '''[[riparian]] buffer''' or '''stream buffer''' is a [[vegetation|vegetated]] area (a "[[buffer strip]]") near a [[stream]], usually [[forest]]ed, which helps shade and partially protect the stream from the impact of adjacent [[land use]]s.  It plays a key role in increasing [[water quality]] in associated streams, [[river]]s, and [[lake]]s, thus providing environmental benefits.  With the decline of many [[aquatic ecosystems]] due to [[agriculture]], riparian buffers have become a very common [[conservation ethic|conservation]] practice aimed at increasing water quality and reducing [[water pollution|pollution]].

== Benefits ==
Riparian buffers act to intercept [[sediment]], [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and other materials in [[surface runoff]] and reduce nutrients and other [[pollutants]] in shallow subsurface water flow.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). (2006).
[ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/391.pdf "National Conservation Practice Standard: Riparian Forest Buffer."] Code 391. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve to provide [[habitat]] and [[wildlife corridor]]s in primarily agricultural areas.  They can also be key in reducing [[erosion]] by providing [[stream bank]] stabilization.

=== Water quality benefits ===
*Intercepting sediments/nutrients - Key to counteract [[eutrophication]] in downstream lakes and ponds which can be detrimental to aquatic habitats because of large [[fish kill]]s that occur upon large-scale eutrophication.
*Intercepting pesticides - Riparian buffers keep chemicals that can be harmful to aquatic life out of the water.  Some pesticides can be especially harmful if they [[bioaccumulate]] in the organism, with the chemicals reaching harmful levels once they are ready for human consumption.
*Bank stabilization - This is important because erosion can be a major problem in agricultural regions when cut (eroded) banks can take land out of production.  Erosion can also lead to [[sedimentation]] and [[siltation]] of downstream lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.  Siltation can greatly reduce the life span of [[reservoir]]s and the [[dam]]s that create the reservoirs.

=== Habitat benefits ===
*Provide habitat - Riparian buffers can act as crucial habitat for a large number of species, especially those who have lost [[habitat]] due to agricultural land being put into production.
*Increase biodiversity - By adding this vegetated area of land near a water source it becomes a prime location for species that may have left the area due to non-conservation land use to re-establish.  With this re-establishment the number of native species and [[biodiversity]] in general can be increased.
*Buffers acting as corridors - Buffers also serve a major role in wildlife habitat. The habitat provided by the buffers also double as corridors for species that have had their habitat fragmented by various land uses.
*Shading water - The large [[tree]]s in the first zone of the riparian buffer provide shade and therefore cooling for the water, increasing productivity and increasing habitat quality for aquatic species.
*[[Large woody debris]] - When branches and stumps fall into the stream from the [[riparian zone]], more stream habitat features are created. [[Carbon]] is added as an energy source for [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] in the stream.

=== Economic benefits ===
*Increase land value - Often people who purchase land for recreational use are willing to pay more if there is more wooded area located on the land.
*Produce profitable alternative crops - Vegetation such as [[Black Walnut]] and [[Hazelnut]], which can be profitably harvested, can be incorporated into the riparian buffer.
*Increase lease fees for hunting - The increased habitat means that the land will be more sought-after for hunting purposes.

== Buffer design ==
[[File:Late Winter Afternoon in Munson Park Wetlands.webm|thumb|Ground level view of riparian buffer between Munson Pond (off camera left) and an agricultural operation (off camera right)]]

A riparian buffer is usually split into three different zones, each having its own specific purpose for filtering runoff and interacting with the adjacent aquatic system. Buffer design is a key element in the effectiveness of the buffer.  It is generally recommended that native species be chosen to plant in these three zones, with the general width of the buffer being {{convert|50|ft|m}} on each side of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;Dosskey, M., Schultz, D., &amp; Isenhart, T. (1997). [https://fs.usda.gov/nac/documents/agroforestrynotes/an03rfb02.pdf "Riparian Buffers for Agricultural Land."] ''Agroforestry Notes,'' No. 3, January 1997. National Agroforestry Center, USDA Forest Service, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 1.''' This zone should function mainly to shade the water source and act as a bank stabilizer.  The zone should include large native tree species that grow fast and can quickly act to perform these tasks.  Although this is usually the smallest of the three zones and absorbs the fewest contaminants, most of the contaminants have been eliminated by Zone 2 and Zone 3.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"&gt;Maryland Cooperative Extension.  "Riparian Forest Buffer Design, Establishment, and Maintenance." University of Maryland, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 2.''' Usually made up of native [[shrubs]], this zone provides a habitat for wildlife, including nesting areas for [[bird]] species.  This zone also acts to slow and absorb contaminants that Zone 3 has missed.  The zone is an important transition between grassland and forest.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Zone 3.''' This zone is important as the first line of defense against contaminants.  It consists mostly of native [[grass]]es and serves primarily to slow water runoff and begin to absorb contaminants before they reach the other zones.  Although these grass strips should be one of the widest zones, they are also the easiest to install.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Streambed Zone.''' The streambed zone of the riparian area is linked closely to Zone 1.  Zone 1 provides fallen limbs, trees, and tree roots that in turn slow water flow, reducing erosional processes associated with increased water flow and flooding. This woody debris also increases habitat and cover for various aquatic species

The [https://fs.usda.gov/nac National Agroforestry Center] has developed a Filter Strip Design tool ([https://fs.usda.gov/nac/tools/AgBufferBuilder.htm AgBufferBuilder]), which is a GIS-based computer program for designing vegetative filter strips around agricultural fields that utilizes terrain analysis to account for spatially non-uniform runoff.

== Species selection (example using both native Nebraska and introduced species) ==
In Zone 1: Cottonwood, Bur Oak, Hackberry, Swamp White Oak, Siberian Elm, Honeylocust, Silver Maple, Black Walnut, and Northern Red Oak.&lt;ref name="NRDTree"&gt;Nebraska Association of Resources Districts (2003). [http://www.nrdnet.org/trees/pdfs/tree_book.pdf "Conservation Trees for Nebraska."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zone 2: [[Prunus mandshurica|manchurian apricot]], Silver Buffaloberry, Caragana, Black Cherry, Chokecherry, Sandcherry, Peking Cotoneaster, Midwest Crabapple, Golden Currant, Elderberry, Washington Hawthorn, American Hazel, Amur Honeysuckle, Common Lilac, Amur Maple, American Plum, and Skunkbush Sumac.&lt;ref name="NRDTree"/&gt;

In Zone 3: Western Wheatgrass, Big Bluestem, Sand Bluestem, Sideoats Grama, Blue Grama, Hairy Grama, Buffalo Grass, Sand Lovegrass, Switchgrass, Little Bluestem, Indiangrass, Prairie Cordgrass, Prairie Dropseed, Tall Dropseed, Needleandthread, Green Needlegrass.

== Managing forests in riparian area ==
[[Logging]] is sometimes recommended as a management practice in riparian buffers, usually to provide economic incentive. However, some studies have shown that logging can harm wildlife populations, especially birds.  A study by the University of Minnesota found that there was a correlation between the harvesting of timber in riparian buffers and a decline in bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Wildlife Management; Apr 2005, Vol. 69 Issue 2, p689-698, 10p&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, logging is generally discouraged as an environmental practice, and left to be done in designated logging areas.

== Conservation incentives ==
The [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP), a farming assistance program in the [[United States]], provides many incentives to landowners to encourage them to install riparian buffers around water systems that have a high chance of non-point water pollution and are highly erodible. For example, the [[Nebraska]] system of Riparian Buffer Payments offers the following:
*Annual rental payments = $62 to $116 per acre/year (up to $96 per acre per year for certain marginal pasture land)
*Sign up bonus: up-front payment of $10 per acre/year for the life of the contract (Example: $150/ac for a fifteen-year contract)
*Payments for 90% of costs for trees, shrubs, grass seed, site preparation and planting
*10 to 15 year contracts
*Eligible areas:
**Up to {{convert|180|ft|m}} average width along each side of a continuous or intermittent stream
**Strips of grass, shrubs, and/or trees can be used
**Planting done by the local Natural Resource Districts (NRDs)	

These incentives are offered to agriculturists to compensate them for their economic loss of taking this land out of production.  If the land is highly erodible and produces little economic gain, it can sometimes be more economic to take advantage of these CRP programs.&lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension. "Benefits of Riparian Forest Buffers (Streamside Plantings of Trees, Shrubs and Grasses)."  University Press, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Riparian buffers have undergone much scrutiny about their effectiveness, resulting in thorough testing and monitoring.  A study done by the [[University of Georgia]], conducted over a nine-year period, monitored the amounts of fertilizers that reached the watershed from the source of the application.  It found that these buffers removed at least 60% of the [[nitrogen]] in the runoff, and at least 65% of the [[phosphorus]] from the fertilizer application.

== Long-term sustainability ==
After the initial installation of the riparian buffer, relatively little maintenance needs to be performed to keep the buffer in good condition.  Once the trees and grasses reach maturity, they regenerate naturally and make a more effective buffer.  The sustainability of the riparian buffer makes it extremely attractive to landowners, since they do relatively little work and still receive payments. Riparian buffers have the potential to be the most effective ways to protect aquatic biodiversity, water quality and manage water resources in developing countries that lack the funds to install water treatment and supply systems in midsize and small towns.

'''Tibet House US Cultural Center of H. H. the Dalai Lama''' was founded in 1987 by [[Columbia University]] professor [[Robert Thurman]], actor [[Richard Gere]] and modern composer [[Philip Glass]] (among others) at the behest of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anonymous report |title=Richard Gere And Dalai Lama Announce Center for Tibetan Culture |url=https://www.apnews.com/a8517d5efbd119474f3db9bd4786b029 |website=AP News |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=13 July 2018 |date=28 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially organized in New York City, USA, and the Tibet House US is still based there. Their current address is 22 West 15th Street, New York, NY 10011, on the 2nd floor.

[[File:Tibet House Building, Delhi, India.jpg|thumb|right|Tibet House Building in Lodhi Road, New Delhi, India]]
Its stated purpose, as taken from the Tibet House US website:
* To present to the West Tibet's ancient traditions of art and culture by means of creating a permanent Cultural Center, with Gallery, Library, and Archives, and developing traveling exhibitions, print publications and media productions
* To preserve and restore Tibet's unique cultural and spiritual heritage, by means of developing a Repatriation Collection for future repatriation of outstanding examples of Tibetan art, creating an archive of rare photographs, opening a research library, making a Web site on the Internet for the wide distribution of information, and providing support to conservation activities both inside and outside of Tibet
* To share with the world Tibet's practical systems of spiritual philosophy and mind sciences, and its arts of human development, intercultural dialogues, nonviolence, and peacemaking, by means of innovative programs in cooperation with educational and other cultural institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12568">'''Universal instructional design''' ('''UID''') or '''universal design for instruction''' ('''UDI''') is an educational [[Conceptual framework|framework]] for applying [[universal design]] principles to [[learning]] environments with a goal toward greater [[accessibility]] for all students, including [[Disabilities|students with disabilities]]. UDI involves considering the potential needs of all learners when designing and delivering instruction by identifying and eliminating unnecessary barriers to teaching and learning while maintaining academic rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burgstahler | first = Sheryl |author2=Burgstahler, S. |author3=Cory, R. | year = 2008 | title = Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TUEmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice&amp;dq=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ySIMUbKqBYvS9AT64oHoCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA | publisher  = Harvard Education Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; UDI is thus proactive and benefits all students, in contrast to providing accommodations for a specific student (e.g., providing a [[sign language]] interpreter for a student who is [[deaf]]).

==Background==

Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) applies and adapts universal design principles and the Principles of Universal Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/design-projects/udi/center-for-universal-design/the-principles-of-universal-design/ Principles of Universal Design, Center for Universal Design, NCSU]&lt;/ref&gt; to learning environments and learning products, with a goal toward maximizing learning for all students.

[[Universal design|Universal design (UD)]], a concept pioneered by architect Ronald Mace at [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State University (NCSU)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciples.htm |title=Center for Universal Design, NCSU |access-date=2008-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513071023/http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciples.htm |archive-date=2008-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to [[buildings]], [[Product (business)|products]], and environments that are inherently accessible to both people without disabilities and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/~edyburn/ud.html#anticipating A Primer on Universal Design (UD) in Education, Dave L. Edyburn, Ph.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Universal Design at NCSU established a set of Principles of Universal Design&lt;ref&gt;Center for Universal Design, [http://www.ncsu.edu/project/design-projects/udi/center-for-universal-design/the-principles-of-universal-design/ Principles of Universal Design]&lt;/ref&gt; based on UD to guide and evaluate the [[design process]], with a goal toward creating more accessible products and environments. Universal Design for Instruction is an educational framework and set of strategies that applies both UD and the Principles of Universal Design to academic and teaching environments, learning products, and learning materials.

Specific UDI [[Conceptual framework|frameworks]] and educational initiatives vary between academic and policy institutions. The Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/CUDE/ Center for Universal Design in Education]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[the DO-IT Center]] ([[University of Washington]]) combines UD, the Principles of Universal Design and [[Universal Design for Learning|Universal Design for Learning (UDL)]] to create UDI strategies for applying universal design to [[educational]] products and [[Knowledge environment|environment]]s.&lt;ref name=EAUDI&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/equal_access_udi.html Equal Access: Universal Design of Instruction]&lt;/ref&gt; Each CUDE strategy is linked with relevant principles of UD and UDL.&lt;ref name =EAUDI/&gt; Using a different approach, the Center on Postsecondary Education and Disability at the [[University of Connecticut]] developed a set of UDI principles that draws on the work of Chickering and Gamson,&lt;ref&gt;Scott, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; who had originally published a set of principles for more inclusive [[postsecondary education]], as well as the Principles of Universal Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tss.uoguelph.ca/uid/uduid.cfm Universal Design and Universal Instructional Design - University og Guelph]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

The original seven Principles of Universal Design for products and environments established by the Center for Universal Design at NSCU&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/design-projects/udi/center-for-universal-design/the-principles-of-universal-design/ The Principles of Universal Design]&lt;/ref&gt; follow; UDI applies these principles to learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, Sheryl, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/ud_edu.html Universal Design in Education: Principles and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Principle 1: Equitable Use
*Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
*Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive
*Principle 4: Perceptible Information
*Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
*Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
*Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

The DO-IT Center's Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) combines UDI strategies and UD principles with the more specific [[Universal Design for Learning|Universal Design for Learning (UDL)]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, Sheryl, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/instruction.html Universal Design of Instruction (UDI): Definition, Principles, Guidelines, and Examples]&lt;/ref&gt; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is "a set of principles for curriculum development that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn."&lt;ref&gt;Center for Applied Special Technology, CAST [http://www.cast.org/udl/faq/ Universal Design in Learning: About UDL ]&lt;/ref&gt; UDL guidelines encourage curriculum designers to provide the student with options with respect to the following:

*UDL 1: Perception
*UDL 2: Language, Expressions, Symbolism
*UDL 3: Comprehension
*UDL 4: Physical Action
*UDL 5: Expressive Skills and Fluency
*UDL 6: Executive Functions
*UDL 7: Recruiting Interest
*UDL 8: Sustaining Effort and Persistence
*UDL 9: Self-Regulation
 

The [[University of Connecticut]] researchers and practitioners propose nine principles that describe a successful implementation of Universal Design ''for'' Instruction. Four of them state that materials and activities should be:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/dept/stdev/Disability/UID-Faculty-Workbook.pdf UID Faculty Workbook - Mohawk College]&lt;/ref&gt;

*1: Accessible and fair,
*2: Flexible,
*3: Straightforward and consistent, and
*4: Explicit. 

Three principles for universal design for instruction state that the learning environment should:
*5: Be supportive,
*6: Minimize unnecessary physical effort, and
*7: Accommodate students and multiple teaching methods.

Universal design for instruction includes two more principles related to the delivery environment:

*8: Tolerance for error and
*9: Size and space for approach and use.

== Examples of application to instruction ==

Ways of applying UD to instruction include those listed below.

* '''Delivery Methods''': Use of a variety of delivery methods and learning approaches, including lecture, discussion, hands-on activities, projects, cases, and Internet-based interaction. All should be accessible to students with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and previous experiences.
* '''Learning Methods and Materials''': Print materials should be available in electronic format. Provide text descriptions of graphics presented on web pages. Use presentation tools to make presentations legible in large spaces. Use captioned video presentations. Provide outlines in advance to allow students to prepare for the topic to be presented. Create printed and web-based materials in simple, intuitive, and consistent formats.
* '''Interaction''': Encourage different ways for students to interact with each other and with the facilitator. This may include in-class questions and discussion, group work, and Internet-based communications.
* '''Feedback''': Provide effective prompting during an activity and feedback after the assignment is complete. Use feedback to help students correct errors and misconceptions. Allow opportunities for self-assessment. Ensure that electronic-based learning tools provide proper feedback for both navigation and learning and are designed in an accessible format.
* '''Assessment/Demonstration of Knowledge''': Ensure that students’ opportunity to demonstrate knowledge is frequent and if possible, flexible. Consider options besides tests and papers for demonstrating knowledge, such as group work, demonstrations, portfolios, and videotaped or on-site presentations.
* '''Physical Effort and Access''': Ensure that classrooms, labs, and field work are accessible to individuals with a wide range of physical abilities. Make sure equipment and activities minimize sustained physical effort and accommodate people with different physical abilities. Ensure the safety of all students. Minimize the need for unnecessary physical travel by making materials available or allowing them to be submitted electronically.

The Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) at the [[The DO-IT Center|DO-IT Center]] describes UDI as "a goal, a process, and a set of practices."&lt;ref name=EAUDI/&gt; According to CUDE, the UDI process is described as the following series of steps:&lt;ref name="EAUDI"/&gt;

#'''Identify the course.''' Describe the course, its learning [[Goal|objectives]], and its overall [[content (media)|content]].
#'''Define the universe.''' Describe the overall [[population]] of students eligible to enroll in the course and then consider their potential diverse characteristics (e.g., with respect to gender; age; [[ethnicity]] and race; native language; learning style; and abilities to see, hear, manipulate objects, read, and communicate).
#'''Involve students.''' Consider perspectives of students with diverse characteristics, as identified in Step 2, in the development of the course. If they are not available directly from students, gain student perspectives through diversity programs such as the campus disability services office.
#'''Adopt instructional strategies.''' Adopt overall learning and teaching philosophies and methods. Integrate these practices with universal design guidelines or strategies for learning or instruction.
#'''Apply instructional strategies.''' Apply universal design strategies in concert with good instructional practices (both identified in Step 4) to the overall choice of course teaching methods, [[curricula]], and assessments. Then apply universal design to all lectures, classroom discussions, group work, handouts, web-based content, labs, fieldwork, assessment instruments, and other academic activities and materials to maximize the learning of students with the wide variety of characteristics identified in Step 2.
#'''Plan for accommodations.''' Learn campus procedures for addressing accommodation requests (e.g., arrangement of sign language interpreters) from specific students for whom the course design does not automatically provide full access.
#'''Evaluate.''' Monitor the effectiveness of instruction through observation and feedback from students with the diverse set of characteristics identified in Step 2, assess learning, and modify the course as appropriate.

The '''School of Library and Information Studies''' of the [[University of the Philippines]] or '''UP-SLIS''' is the oldest library school in the [[Philippines]]. Formally established in March 1961 as the Institute of Library Science, it can trace it roots to 1914, making it one of the first library schools in Asia. It is an independent degree-granting unit of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], and offers programs in the field of [[Library and Information Science]].

==Gonzalez Hall==
Constructed in the 1950s almost simultaneously with the arts and sciences, administration and engineering buildings, the Main Library was one of the first structures in the Diliman campus, designed by [[Juan Nakpil]], the campus architect of that time.

The campus’ main library was later named Gonzalez Hall, in homage of the former UP President Bienvenido M. Gonzalez. It was purposely fashioned after the administration building, now known as Quezon Hall, just like how the arts and letters and engineering buildings were mirror images of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quilaneta|first1=Thinette Joy|title=The Heart of UP Diliman|url=http://www.heritage.org.ph/article.php?id=52|website=www.heritage.org.ph|publisher=Heritage Conservation Society|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The UP-SLIS is situated at the South Wing, 3rd Floor, of the Gonzalez Hall, [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]. When all colleges and units of the National Science Complex (NSC) would have already transferred to the NSC's buildings, UP-SLIS shall move into and occupy the Institute of Biology Zoology Building which shall become its permanent home.

==Academics==
Starting in 1995, the School offered the Bachelor of Library and Information Science. The program aims to ''prepare students for career opportunities in professional librarianship, publishing and book trade, and information-related business.'' This program replaced the Bachelor of Library Science. A new curriculum introduced in 2002 integrated the University's [[University of the Philippines#General education program|Revised General Education Program]] and offered several specialization tracks, including archives and records management, health and medical librarianship, information systems, and law librarianship. Since 1962, the then Institute offered a Master of Library Science Program, the first in the country, and has since been updated as Master of Library and Information Science.

Aside from the undergraduate and graduate programs, the School also offers a one-year program in librarianship and conducts review courses and simulation exams for the Licensure Examination for Librarians.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The School can trace its roots back to 1914, thirty years after [[Melvil Dewey]] established the first School of Library Economy in [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. Library courses were offered under the College of Liberal Arts under [[James Alexander Robertson]], UP's first library science professor. This made the University the first library school in the Philippines, and one of the first in Asia. The first full library studies program was offered two years later, in 1916.

In March 1961, the Institute of Library Science was formally established, and a year later, the institute established its graduate program. From 1978 to 1984, the Institute was selected by [[UNESCO]] as the host institution to the Postgraduate Training Course for Science Information Specialists in Southeast Asia. In 2002, the Institute was renamed into the Institute of Library and Information Science in order to keep up with the nomenclature for the field. This required the institute to set up the first IT Applications Lab and Computer Lab for a library school in the Philippines. On March 27, 2007, the Board of Regents approved the Institute's petition to rename itself as the School of Library and Information Studies.

Limited space requirements and dilapidated conditions of the current location of the UP-SLIS at the Third Floor of the Gonzalez Hall prompted the school to launch a building fund to raise funds for the construction or renovation of a building for the transfer of its physical facilities in April 2007. Currently, it has reserved the Institute of Biology building as the future site for any such transfer. The building was chosen due to its proximity to the Main Library, which serves as the laboratory for LIS students.&lt;ref name="SLISHistory4"&gt;UPSLIS Building Fund Updates. UPLSAA Newsletter May-Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from the school consistently top and register the highest passing rates (93% Passing rate out of the 30% National Average in 2005,&lt;ref name="LLE2005"&gt;[http://www.inq7.net/exam/lib11082005.pdf Results of the 2005 Licensure Examination for Librarians].

A '''vaginal septum''' is a [[vaginal anomalies|vaginal anomaly]] that is partition within the [[vagina]]; such a [[septum]] could be either longitudinal or transverse. In some affected women, the septum is partial or does not extend the length or width of the vagina.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinonen|first=Pentti K.|date=2006-03-01|title=Complete septate uterus with longitudinal vaginal septum|url=http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)03968-3/fulltext|journal=Fertility and Sterility|language=English|volume=85|issue=3|pages=700–705|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.039|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dyspareunia|Pain during intercourse]] can be a symptom. A longitudinal vaginal septum develops during [[embryogenesis]] when there is an incomplete fusion of the lower parts of the two [[Müllerian duct]]s. As a result, there may appear to be two openings to the vagina. There may be associated duplications of the more cranial parts of the Müllerian derivatives, a double [[cervix]], and either a [[uterine septum]] or [[uterus didelphys]] (double uterus).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perez-Brayfield MR, Clarke HS, Pattaras JG |title=Complete bladder, urethral, and vaginal duplication in a 50-year-old woman |journal=Urology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=514 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12350504 |doi=10.1016/S0090-4295(02)01808-3  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090429502018083}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transverse septum forms during embryogenesis when the Müllerian ducts do not fuse to the [[urogenital sinus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10423">'''Vision rehabilitation''' (often called '''vision rehab''') is a term for a [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|medical rehabilitation]] to improve vision or [[low vision]]. In other words, it is the process of restoring functional ability and improving quality of life and independence in an individual who has lost visual function through illness or injury.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt Jr, E. N., &amp; Pope, A. M. (Eds.). (1997). ''Enabling America: Assessing the role of rehabilitation science and engineering''. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheiman, M. 2007"&gt;Scheiman, M., Scheiman, M., &amp; Whittaker, S. (2007). ''Low vision rehabilitation: A practical guide for occupational therapists''. SLACK Incorporated.&lt;/ref&gt; Most visual rehabilitation services are focused on low vision, which is a [[visual impairment]] that cannot be fully corrected by regular eyeglasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery. Low vision interferes with the ability to perform everyday activities.&lt;ref name="Daily Activities"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu, C.J., Brost, M.A., Horton, V.E, Kenyon, S.B., &amp; Mears, K.E.|title=Occupational Therapy Interventions to Improve Performance of Daily Activities at Home for Older Adults with Low Vision:A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Occupational Therapy|year=2013|volume=67|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual impairment is caused by factors including [[brain damage]], [[vision loss]], and others.&lt;ref name="1-page Brain Injury"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher, K., &amp; Barton, J.J.S.|title=Vision Rehabilitation: multidisciplinary care of the patient following brain injury|journal=Perception|year=2012|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1287–1288| doi = 10.1068/p4110rvw }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the vision rehabilitation techniques available, most center on neurological and physical approaches.

== Definition ==
Rehabilitation (literally, the act of making able again) helps patients achieve physical, social, emotional, spiritual independence and quality of life.&lt;ref name="Vision Rehab_Gov_Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vision Rehabilitation for Elderly Individuals with Low Vision or Blindness|year=2004|publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services|location=USA|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rehabilitation does not undo or reverse the cause of damage; it seeks to promote function and independence through adaptation. Individuals can seek rehabilitation in different domains, such as [[motor rehabilitation]] after a stroke or physical rehabilitation after a car accident.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsford, J., Sloan, S., &amp; Snow, P. (2012). Traumatic brain injury: Rehabilitation for everyday adaptive living. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Low vision can be caused by many diseases.&lt;ref name="Vision Rehab_Gov_Book"/&gt;

== Clinical studies and treatments ==

=== Neurological approach===
There are many treatments and therapies to slow degradation of vision loss or improve the vision using neurological approaches. Studies have found that low vision can be restored to good vision.&lt;ref name="1-page Brain Injury" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markowitz | first1 = S. N. | year = 2006 | title = Principles of modern low vision rehabilitation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 289–312 | doi = 10.1139/i06-027 | pmid=16767184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, vision cannot be restored to normal levels but progressive visual loss can be stopped through interventions.&lt;ref name="Vision Rehab_Gov_Book" /&gt;

==== Chemical treatments ====
In general, chemical treatments are designed to slow the process of vision loss. Some research is done with [[neuroprotective treatment]] that will slow the progression of vision loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pardue | first1 = MT | last2 = Phillips | first2 = MJ | last3 = Yin | first3 = H | last4 = Sippy | first4 = BD | last5 = Webb-wood | first5 = S | last6 = Chow | first6 = AY | last7 = Ball | first7 = SL | year = 2005 | title = Neuroprotective effect of subretinal implants in the RCS rat | url = | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 674–682 | doi=10.1167/iovs.04-0515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite other approaches existing, neuroprotective treatments seem to be most common among all chemical treatments.

==== Gene therapy====
[[Gene therapy]] uses DNA as a delivery system to treat visual impairments. In this approach, DNA is modified through a viral vector, and then cells related to vision cease translating faulty proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Strachan, T., &amp; Read, A. P. (1999). Gene therapy and other molecular genetic-based therapeutic approaches.&lt;/ref&gt; Gene therapy seems to be the most prominent field that might be able to restore vision through therapy. However, there are some problems with gene therapy which can lead to severe conditions such as death{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

=== Physical approach===
For physical approaches to vision rehabilitation, most of the training is focused on ways to make environments easier to deal with for those with low vision. [[Occupational therapy]] is commonly suggested for these patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGrath | first1 = C. E. | last2 = Rudman | first2 = D. L. | year = 2013 | title = Factors that influence the occupational engagement of older adults with low vision: a scoping review | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 5| pages = 234–241 | doi = 10.4276/030802213x13679275042762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there are devices that help patients achieve higher standards of living. These include video magnifiers, peripheral prism glasses, [[transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS), [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV), [[RFID]] devices, electronic badges with emergency alert systems, virtual sound systems, and smart wheelchairs.

==== Mobility training====
[[Mobility training]] improves the ability for patients with visual impairment to live independently by training patients to become more mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeon | first1 = B.-J. | last2 = Cha | first2 =  | year = 2013 | title = The Effects of Balance of Low Vision Patients on Activities of Daily Living | url = | journal = Journal of Physical Therapy Science | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 693–696 | doi=10.1589/jpts.25.693| pmc = 3804998}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low vision patients, there are multiple mobility training methods and devices available including the 3D sound virtual reality system, talking [[braille]], and RFID floors.

The 3D sound virtual reality system transforms sounds into locations and maps the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lentz | first1 = T. | last2 = Schröder | first2 = D. | last3 = Vorländer | first3 = M. | last4 = Assenmacher | first4 = I. | year = 2007 | title = Virtual reality systems with integrated sound field simulation and reproduction | url = | journal = EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing | volume = 2007 | issue = 1| pages = 187–187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system alerts patients to avoid possible dangers. The talking braille is a device that helps low vision patients to read braille by detecting light and transmitting this information through Bluetooth technology.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, D. A., &amp; Lightman, A. (2005, October). Talking braille: a wireless ubiquitous computing network for orientation and way-finding. In Proceedings of the 7th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility (pp. 98-105). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; RFID floors are GPS-like navigation systems which help patients to detect building interiors, which ultimately allow them to detour around obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Mori, T., Suemasu, Y., Noguchi, H., &amp; Sato, T. (2004, October). Multiple people tracking by integrating distributed floor pressure sensors and RFID system. In Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 2004 IEEE International Conference on (Vol. 6, pp. 5271-5278). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Home skills training====
[[Home skills training]] allows patients to improve communication skills, self-care skills, cognitive skills, socialization skills, vocational training, psychological testing, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = | title = Occupational Therapy Interventions to Promote Driving and Community Mobility for Older Adults With Low Vision: A Systematic Review | url = | journal = American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 67 | issue = 3| pages = 296–302 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.2013.005660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study indicates that multicomponent group interventions for older adults with low vision as an effective approach related to home training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = S. | last2 = McAteer | first2 = J. | last3 = Schreier | first3 = K. | last4 = Kaldenberg | first4 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Occupational Therapy Interventions to Improve Leisure and Social Participation for Older Adults With Low Vision: A Systematic Review | url = | journal = American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 67 | issue = 3| pages = 303–311 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.2013.005447 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The multicomponent group interventions include learning new knowledge or skills each week, having multiple sessions to allow participants to apply learned knowledge or skills in their living environment, and building relationships with their health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smallfield | first1 = S. | last2 = Clem | first2 = K. | last3 = Myers | first3 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Occupational Therapy Interventions to Improve the Reading Ability of Older Adults With Low Vision: A Systematic Review | url = | journal = American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 67 | issue = 3| pages = 288–295 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.2013.004929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factor in this intervention is support from family, which includes assistance with changes in lifestyles, financial concerns, and future planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = P.

'''Wheeler James North''' (January 2, 1922 – December 20, 2002), born in [[San Francisco, California]], was a marine biologist and [[Environmental science|environmental scientist]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He is best known for his pioneering work to understand the ecology of California’s coastal kelp forests, and pioneering work in biomass fuels and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

== Early life, military service and education ==
North was born January 2, 1922 in San Francisco to Wheeler O. and Florence (Ross) North, and grew up at a mining camp at La Fe in [[Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]], as his father was a mining engineer and his mother was an assay chemist.  In 1927, the family moved to [[La Jolla, California]].  In 1940 North graduated from [[The Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]] and entered college at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).  While still in college in December 1942, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]], which allowed him to complete his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1944.  After training in U.S. Army [[Officers Candidate School]] at [[Fort Monmouth]] in New Jersey, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Signal Corps and assigned to the [[Philippines]].  However, he arrived in Southeast Asia after [[VJ Day]] in August 1945 but stayed in the Philippines and [[Japan]] as part of the American occupying forces until August 1946.  After two years working with the U.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory in [[San Diego]], North returned to Caltech in September 1948 and completed a second bachelor's degree in biology in 1950.  He earned masters and Ph.D. degrees in [[Biological Oceanography]] at the [[University of California]] [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in 1953 studying in the laboratory of Denis Fox.  He undertook postdoctoral work with a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship at the [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]] and [[Cambridge University]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/34/00/OH_North_W.pdf | title= Wheeler J. North oral history (1998) | publisher= California Institute of Technology | accessdate= December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
North began his academic career teaching at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1953, after which he joined the faculty of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in September 1962.  Although North taught [[marine biology]] courses at the Caltech main campus in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], he spent much of his time undertaking research at the Caltech’s [[Kerckhoff marine laboratory|Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] in [[Corona Del Mar, California|Corona del Mar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/LXVI/north.html| title= Wheeler J. North (1922-2002) | publisher= California Institute of Technology | accessdate= December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North’s principal research interest was [[marine ecology]], specifically the kelp beds off Southern California and the [[population ecology]] of sea urchins. He studied the effects of sewage outfalls and [[El Niño]] on [[kelp forests]], and the predation of kelp by [[sea urchins]].  He served as a consultant for California’s kelp-harvesting industry.  He was one of the first marine scientists to employ [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] technology for marine research beginning as a student in 1949.  While at Scripps, he worked with group studying the physiology of diving and was a pioneer in establishing scientific diving safety protocols.  He was a consulting scientist after the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], and after [[1973 oil crisis]], he studied the possibility of [[kelp| kelp farms]] to produce [[Algae fuel|biomass]] as an alternative fuel.  He contributed to the growth of the [[Kelp#Commercial kelp production in China|kelp farming]] industry in China.  He also studied the ecological effects of warm-water discharges from [[nuclear power plants]] on kelp forests, and in the early 1990s he undertook studies to reduce atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] using [[Biomass (ecology)|marine biomass]] and [[clathrate hydrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/34/|title=Interview with Wheeler J.

'''White-nose syndrome''' ('''WNS''') is an emerging disease in North American [[bat]]s which by 2018 has killed millions of bats in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=deathtoll&gt;{{cite news|title=NUSGS report on white-nose syndrome|url=https://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/white-nose_syndrome/|date=May 2018 |accessdate=2018-07-07|publisher=US Geological Survey|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is named for a distinctive [[fungus|fungal]] [[hypha|growth]] around the muzzles and on the wings of hibernating bats. It was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in [[Schoharie County, New York]].&lt;ref name=science2009&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18974316 |doi=10.1126/science.1163874 |title=Bat White-Nose Syndrome: An Emerging Fungal Pathogen? |year=2009 |last1=Blehert |first1=D.

The disease is caused by the fungus ''[[Pseudogymnoascus destructans]]'', which colonizes the bat's skin. No obvious treatment or means of preventing transmission is known,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21096-bat-killer-identified-but-deaths-continue.html|title=Bat killer identified|work=New Scientist|first=Andy|last=Coghlan|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferrante|first=Julia|title=Bucknell University professor, national research team identify cause of White-Nose Syndrome in bats|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x72869.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species have declined &gt;90% within five years of the disease reaching a site.&lt;ref name=Langwig_2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langwig|first=K.E.|author2=W.F.

Beyond the direct effect on bat populations, WNS has broader ecological implications. The Forest Service estimated in 2008 that the die-off from white-nose syndrome means that at least 2.4 million pounds of insects (1.1 million kg) will go uneaten and become a financial burden to farmers, possibly leading to crop damage or having other economic impact in [[New England]].&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe20080207&gt;{{cite news |title=Die-off of bats could hurt area crops |author=Daley, Beth |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/02/07/die_off_of_bats_could_hurt_area_crops/ |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that bats save farmers in the U.S. 3 billion dollars annually in pest control services.

==Research==
[[File:A Million Bats Dead from Mysterious Disease.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3:34|2009 [[VOA]] report about the disease]] 
Biologists of the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] have been collecting information at each site in regard to the number of bats affected, the geographic extent of the outbreaks and samples of affected bats. They developed a geographic database to track the location of sites, where WNS has been found.&lt;ref name=US&gt;US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Northeast Region, "White-Nose Syndrome in bats: Something is killing our bats." http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html (accessed April 14, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Fish and Wildlife Service has been partnering with the Northeastern [[Cave Conservancy]] to track movements of cavers that have visited affected sites in New York.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

In 2009, the Service advised closing caves to explorers in 20 states, from the Midwest to New England. This directive was supposed to be extended to 13 southern states. One Virginia scientist stated, "If it gets into caves more to our south, in places like Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Alabama, we’re going to be talking deaths in the millions."&lt;ref name = Economist/&gt; In March 2012, WNS was discovered on some [[tri-colored bats]] (''Perimyotis subflavus'') in [[Russell Cave]] in [[Jackson County, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=ala/&gt;

===Cause===
[[File:Geomyces destructans.gif|thumb|''Pseudogymnoascus destructans'']]

The genera ''Geomyces'' and ''[[Pseudogymnoascus]]'' are closely related and found in the family ''[[Pseudeurotiaceae]]''; ''P. destructans'' was found to be most closely related to the ''Pseudogymnoascus'' species in 2013, implying that its name should be changed to ''Pseudogymnoascus destructans''.&lt;ref name=Minnis &gt;{{cite journal |author= Minnis AM, Lindner DL |title = Phylogenetic evaluation of ''Geomyces'' and allies reveals no close relatives of ''Pseudogymnoascus destructans'', comb. nov., in bat hibernacula of eastern North America |journal= Fungal Biology |volume = 117 |issue = 9 |pages = 638–49 |date=July 2013 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878614613001025# | doi = 10.1016/j.funbio.2013.07.001|pmid = 24012303 |last2 = Lindner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infection===
A laboratory experiment suggests that physical contact is required for one bat to infect another, because bats in mesh cages adjacent to infected bats did not contract the fungus. This implies that the fungus is not [[airborne disease|airborne]], or at least, is not transmitted from bat to bat through the air.&lt;ref name=Lorch_2011 /&gt; The primary way this fungus is spread is through bat-to-bat contact or infected cave-to-bat contact. The role of humans in the spread of the disease is debated. It is likely the fungus was brought to North America by human activities, because no bats normally migrate between Europe and North America, and the fungus was first discovered in New York where there are major trans-Atlantic air and shipping terminals. Geographical translocation of bats by ship and airplane have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geographic Translocation of Bats: Known and Potential Problems|journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 1080-6040|pmc = 2873759|pmid = 12533276|pages = 17–21|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.3201/EID0901.020104|first = Denny G.|last = Constantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown the fungus can persist on human clothing and thus could be carried between locations by people, but as of 2016 it has not been demonstrated that this has played any role in the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|title=Bureau Land Management: "How is White-Nose Syndrome Spread?"|publisher=|access-date=2016-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301104331/http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|archive-date=2016-03-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = White-Nose Syndrome|url = http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|website = www.blm.gov|date = 2014-11-28|access-date = 2016-02-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301104331/http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/wildlife/white-nose_syndrome.html|archive-date = 2016-03-01|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Signs of disease====
The signs observed with WNS include unusual winter behavior like abnormally frequent or abnormally long arousal from [[torpor]] (temporary hibernation), flying, loss of body fat, damage and scarring of the wing membranes, and death.
As early as 2011 it was hypothesized that prematurely expending the fat reserves for winter survival may be a cause for death.&lt;ref name=usfws2011&gt;{{cite web|title=A National Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies, and Tribes in Managing White-Nose Syndrome in Bats|url=https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/sites/default/files/white-nose_syndrome_national_plan_may_2011.pdf|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=10 January 2015|pages=21|format=pdf|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathophysiology====

Until December 2014 the cause for the abnormal behavior was unclear, as no physiological data linking altered behavior to hypothesized increased energy demands existed. 
 
The Fish and Wildlife Service published a case control study in December 2014:  Of 60 little brown bats, 39 bats were randomly assigned to infection by applying conidia to skin of the dorsal surface of both wings and 21 bats remained controls. All were observed for 95 days and euthanized. 32 bats developed WNS (30 mild to moderate and 2 moderate to severe). The remaining seven infected bats were PCR-positive with normal wing histology.
Infected bats with WNS had higher proportions of lean tissue mass to fat tissue mass than uninfected bats in measuring an increase in total body water volume as a percent of body mass. Infected bats used twice as much energy as healthy bats, and starved to death. Direct calculations of energy expenditure failed for most bats, because isotope concentrations were indistinguishable from background. There was also no difference in torpor durations in this experiment; the average torpor duration for infected bats was 9.1 days with an average arousal of 54 min. Average torpor duration for control bats was 8.5 days with an average arousal duration of 55 min.&lt;ref name=Verant&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Michelle L Verant, Carol U Meteyer, John R Speakman, Paul M Cryan, Jeffrey M Lorch, David S Blehert|title=White-nose syndrome initiates a cascade of physiologic disturbances in the hibernating bat host|journal=BMC Physiology|date=9 December 2014|volume=14|issue=10|doi=10.1186/s12899-014-0010-4|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/14/10|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infected bats suffered [[respiratory acidosis]] with an almost 40% higher mean pCO₂ than healthy bats, and [[potassium]] concentration was significantly higher.&lt;ref name=Verant/&gt;
Hence the following model of infection exists:
''Pseudogymnoascus destructans'' colonizes and eventually invades the wing epidermis. This causes increased energy expenditure, and an elevated blood pCO₂ and bicarbonate called chronic respiratory acidosis, possibly due to diffusion problems. Hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium) ensues because of an acidosis-induced extracellular shift of potassium. Dying, infected cells could also leak their (intracellular) potassium into the blood. The damaged wing epidermis might stimulate increased frequencies of arousal from torpor, which removes excess CO₂ and normalizes blood pH, at the expense of hydration and fat reserves. With worsening wing damage, the effects are exacerbated by water and electrolyte loss across the wound (hypotonic dehydration), which stimulates more frequent arousals in a positive feedback loop that ultimately leads to death.&lt;ref name=Verant/&gt;

The infected bat was a [[Yuma myotis]] (''Myotis yumanensis''), which was the first time the disease has been found in this species.&lt;ref name="WNS May17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/blog/researchers-work-stop-spread-white-nose-syndrome-washington |title=Researchers work to stop the spread of white-nose syndrome in Washington |last=Froschauer| first=Ann |date=May 11, 2017 |website= white-nose syndrome.org|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the fungus was found on bats in six north Texas counties, bringing the number of states with the fungus to 33.  Three bat species tested positive.&lt;ref name="Texas Parks and Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fungus that Causes White-nose Syndrome in Bats Detected in Texas|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/newsmedia/releases/?req=20170323c|website=Texas Parks and Wildlife|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife|accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, it was announced that bats in [[Kansas]] were documented with white-nose syndrome, making it the first time infected bats were found in Kansas.&lt;ref name="Kansas 2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ksal.com/bat-disease-detected-in-kansas/| title=Bat Disease Detected in Kansas| author=Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism| date=2 April 2018| website=KSAL.com| publisher=Rocking M Media| access-date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced that bats in [[Manitoba]] were found to be infected with white-nose syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=43983&amp;posted=2018-05-18|title=Province of Manitoba {{!}} News Releases {{!}} White-nose Bat Syndrome Found in Manitoba|work=Province of Manitoba|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decontamination===

The fungus ''[[Pseudogymnoascus destructans]]'', or a closely related species of fungus, has been found in soil samples from infected caves and suggests that it can be transported from cave to cave by soil, such as that carried by human clothing.&lt;ref name=Linder_2022&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linder|first=Daniel|author2=Blehert |title=DNA-based detection of the fungal pathogen Geomyces destructans in soils from bat hibernacula|journal=Mycologia|date=2011-03-18|volume=103|issue=2|pages=241–246|pmid=20952799|url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/103/2/241.full|doi=10.3852/10-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precautionary decontamination methods are being encouraged to inhibit the possible spread of spores by humans. The WNS Decontamination Team, a sub-group of the Disease Management Working Group, published a national decontamination protocol on March 15, 2012. They revised the protocol on June 25, 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=WNS Decontamination Team|title=National White-Nose Syndrome Decontamination Protocol v 06.25.2012|url=http://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/sites/default/files/resource/national_wns_revise_final_6.25.12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, based upon laboratory tests, a recommendation was issued to increase the temperature of the hot water treatment for submersible gear to {{convert|60|C|F|abbr=on}} for 20 minutes (up from {{convert|50|C|F|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Geboy|first=Richard|title=National Decontamination Protocol Update |publisher= Midwest Regional WNS Coordinator, US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|url=http://caves.org/WNS/Decon%20Update.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other guidance in the existing protocol should be followed.
 
As of 2008, cave management and preservation organizations had begun requesting that cave visitors limit their activities and disinfect clothing and equipment that has been used in possibly infected caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Something is killing our bats: The white-nose syndrome mystery |publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service |url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current protocol goes further, and indicates that in many cases it is inappropriate to reuse even disinfected gear, and that new gear should be used.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|see p.3 flow chart}}

In some cases, access to caves is being closed entirely.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news |author=Munger, Edward, Jr. |title=Group asking cavers to keep out |url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2008/feb/14/0214_caves/ |work=[[Daily Gazette]] |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] Commissioner Basil Seggos, "Research ... demonstrates that white-nose syndrome makes bats highly susceptible to disturbances. Even a single, seemingly quiet visit can kill bats that would otherwise survive the winter. If you see hibernating bats, assume you are doing harm and leave immediately." When hibernating bats are disturbed, it raises their body temperatures, depleting fat reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEC Reminds the Public to Avoid Seasonal Caves and Mines to Protect Bat Populations|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/press/108239.html|publisher=[[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]]|accessdate=1 November 2016|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word guessing''' refers to a method of [[Reading (process)|reading]] where a beginner reader doesn't know what a word is in a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], so he/she guesses what the word is and reads the rest of the sentence to confirm their guess, e.g. The fox jumped over the dog. If you didn't know the word "jumped" then you might read it as: "joo-mp-ed" then you would read the rest of the sentence and realise that it was actually "jumped".{{or|date=July 2012}}
