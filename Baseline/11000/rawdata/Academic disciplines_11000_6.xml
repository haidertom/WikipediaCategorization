      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3157">The '''''adaptor hypothesis''''' is part of a scheme to explain how information encoded in [[DNA]] is used to specify the [[amino acid sequence]] of [[proteins]]. It was formulated by [[Francis Crick]] in the mid-1950s, together with the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] and the [[sequence hypothesis]]. It first appeared in an informal publication of the [[RNA Tie Club]] in 1955 and was formally published in an article  “On Protein Synthesis” in 1958.

;'''Explanation'''

The adaptor hypothesis was framed to explain how information could be extracted from a [[nucleic acid]] and used to put together a string of amino acids in a specific sequence, that sequence being determined by the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid (DNA or [[RNA]]) template. Crick proposed that each amino acid is first attached to its own specific “adaptor” piece of nucleic acid (in an [[enzyme catalysis| enzyme-catalysed]] reaction). The order of assembly of the amino acids is then determined by a specific recognition between the adaptor and the  nucleic acid which is serving as the informational template. In this way the amino acids could be lined up by the template in a specific order. Coupling between adjacent amino acids would then lead to the synthesis of a polypeptide whose sequence is determined by the template nucleic acid.

;'''Basis'''

Crick’s  thinking behind this proposal was based on a general consideration of the chemical properties of the two classes of molecule — nucleic acids and proteins. The amino acids are characterised by having a variety of side chains which vary from being [[hydrophilic]] to [[hydrophobic]]: their individual characters reside in the very different properties these side chains have. By contrast, a nucleic acid is composed of a string of nucleotides whose sequence presents a geometrically defined surface for [[hydrogen bonding]]. This makes nucleic acids good at recognising each other, but poor at distinguishing the varied side chains of amino acids. It was this apparent lack of any possibility of specific recognition of amino acid side chains by a nucleotide sequence which led Crick to conclude that amino acids would first become attached to a small nucleic acid — the adaptor — and that this, by base-pairing with the template (presumably as occurs between DNA strands in the double helix), would carry the amino acids to be lined up on the template.

;'''Proof'''

That such adaptors do exist was discovered by [[Mahlon Hoagland]] and [[Paul Zamecnik]] in 1958. These “soluble RNAs” are now called [[transfer RNA]]s and mediate the translation of [[messenger RNA]]s on [[ribosomes]] according to the rules contained in the [[genetic code]]. Crick imagined that his adaptors would be small, perhaps 5-10 nucleotides long. In fact, they are much larger, having a more complex role to play in [[protein synthesis]], and are closer to 100 nucleotides in length.

[[Image:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.6|A [[vortex]] is created by the passage of an aircraft wing, revealed by smoke. Vortices are one of the many phenomena associated with the study of aerodynamics.]]

'''Aerodynamics''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀήρ ''aer'' (air) + δυναμική (dynamics), is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.  The term ''aerodynamics'' is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. 
The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as [[aerodynamic drag]] were recorded much earlier.  Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving [[Aircraft#Heavier than air – aerodynes|heavier-than-air flight]], which was first demonstrated by [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Stork Inspired Human Flight |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/how-stork-inspired-human-flight.html|publisher= flyingmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.  Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to [[compressible flow]], [[turbulence]], and [[boundary layer]]s and has become increasingly [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational]] in nature.

==History==
{{main article|History of aerodynamics}}
Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wind Power's Beginnings (1000 BC – 1300 AD) Illustrated History of Wind Power Development |url=http://telosnet.com/wind/early.html|publisher= Telosnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Don |last=Berliner |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&amp;pg=PA128 |title=Aviation: Reaching for the Sky |publisher= The Oliver Press, Inc. |page=128 |isbn= 1-881508-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Ancient Greek]] legend of [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ovid |author2=Gregory, H. | title=The Metamorphoses | publisher=Signet Classics | year=2001 | isbn=0-451-52793-3 | oclc=45393471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental concepts of [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[pressure gradient]]s appear in the work of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"/&gt;

In 1726, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the first aerodynamicists. [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] followed in 1738 with ''Hydrodynamica'' in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as [[Bernoulli's principle]], which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, [[Leonhard Euler]] published the more general [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Navier, C. L. M. H. | title=Memoire sur les lois du mouvement des fluides | journal=Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=6|pages=389–440 | year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stokes, G. | title=On the Theories of the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_39179_onthetheoriesoftheinternalfric1849 | journal=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=8|pages=287–305 | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navier-Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes.

[[Image:WB Wind Tunnel.jpg|thumb|A replica of the [[Wright brothers]]' [[wind tunnel]] is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics.]]

In 1799, [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight ([[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[thrust]]), as well as the relationships between them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S Centennial of Flight Commission – Sir George Cayley. |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2008-09-10 |quote=Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation. A pioneer in his field, he was the first to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight – weight, lift, drag, and thrust and their relationship. He was also the first to build a successful human-carrying glider. Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern airplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the concepts of lift and thrust. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920052758/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;''Cayley, George''.

Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so outlined the path toward achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century.  In 1871, [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] constructed the first [[wind tunnel]], allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces.  Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik |volume=70|pages=289–298 | year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=2| issue=13 |pages=430–441 |doi=10.1080/14786447608639132| year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | journal=L'Aéronaute |volume=22|pages= 73–81 | year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Lilienthal]], the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag.  Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.

During the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451–477 | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.

As aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound.  The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]].  The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift für Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72–74 | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken for the first time in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.  Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

==Fundamental concepts==
[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces of flight on an [[airfoil]]]]
Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on the object.  In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], [[thrust]], and [[weight]].  Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body.  Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, [[momentum]], and energy in air flows.  Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, [[viscosity]], are used to classify flow fields. 

===Flow classification===
Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.

[[Compressibility|Compressible flow]] accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.

Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).

====Continuum assumption====
Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete [[molecule]]s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.

The validity of the [[continuum assumption]] is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the [[mean free path]] length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000&amp;nbsp;ft/90&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"&gt;{{cite book|last = Anderson|first = John David | title = A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1997| location=New York, NY | isbn=0-521-45435-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or satellites in [[Low Earth orbit]]. In those cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.

===Conservation laws===
The assumption of  a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]] allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using [[Fluid dynamics#Conservation laws|fluid dynamics conservation laws]]. Three conservation principles are used: 
# [[Conservation of mass]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity equation]], which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.
# [[Conservation of momentum]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both [[surface force]]s, such as viscous ([[friction]]al) forces, and [[body force]]s, such as [[gravity|weight]].  The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a [[Vector space|vector]] equation or separated into a set of three [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].  The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using [[computational fluid dynamics|computational techniques]]. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.
# [[Conservation of energy]]: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by the fluid flow, by [[heat transfer]], or by [[Work (physics)|work]] into and out of the region of interest.

The [[ideal gas law]] or another such [[equation of state]] is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.

==Branches of aerodynamics==
Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including [[flow speed]], [[compressibility]], and [[viscosity]]. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.

Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the [[flow speed]] is below, near or above the [[speed of sound]]. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with [[Mach number]]s above 5 to be hypersonic.&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"/&gt;

The influence of [[viscosity]] on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.

===Incompressible aerodynamics===
{{further information|incompressible flow}}
An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space.  Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  The [[Mach number]] is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.

====Subsonic flow====
Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Joseph|title=Low-speed aerodynamics: From wing theory to panel methods|series=McGraw-Hill series in aeronautical and aerospace engineering|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill
|location=New York|isbn=0-07-050446-6|oclc=21593499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102&amp;nbsp;m) per second or 228 miles (366&amp;nbsp;km) per hour at 60&amp;nbsp;°F (16&amp;nbsp;°C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.

===Compressible aerodynamics===
{{main article|Compressible flow}}
According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the [[density]] changes along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.

====Transonic flow====
{{main article|Transonic}}
The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.

====Supersonic flow====
{{main article|Supersonic}}
Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is "told" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that "information" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid "knows" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]]—in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.

====Hypersonic flow====
{{main article|Hypersonic}}
In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

==Associated terminology==
[[File:Types of flow analysis in fluid mechanics.svg|thumb|Different types flow analysis around an airfoil: 
  {{legend|#f3f3fd|[[Potential flow]] theory}}
  {{legend|#ff9665|[[Boundary layer|Boundary layer flow]] theory}}
  {{legend|#3b3bde|[[Turbulence|Turbulent wake]] analysis}}]]

The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.

===Boundary layers===
{{main article|Boundary layer}}
The concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.

===Turbulence===
{{main article|Turbulence}}
In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called [[laminar flow]].

==Aerodynamics in other fields==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
===Engineering design===
{{Further information|Automotive aerodynamics}}
Aerodynamics is a significant factor in [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s, and in the prediction of forces and moments acting on [[sailing|sailing vessels]]. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] resort to aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], when calculating [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings, [[bridge]]s, and [[Wind turbine design|wind turbines]] 

The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.

===Environmental design===
Urban aerodynamics are studied by [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers seeking to improve [[amenity]] in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. 

Aerodynamic equations are used in [[numerical weather prediction]].

===Ball-control in sports===
Sports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include [[Association football|soccer]], [[cricket]] and golf, in which control over the trajectory of ball movement is sought by expert players who can, for instance, exploit the "[[Magnus effect#In sport|Magnus effect]]" and other environmental conditions to advantage.

'''Angelos Delivorrias''' ({{lang-el|Άγγελος Δεληβορριάς}}; 16 August 1937&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scuoladiatene.it/archivio-in-evidenza/in-memoriam-angelos-delivorrias.html ]{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 24 April 2018) was a [[Greece|Greek]] archeologist who was the director of [[Benaki Museum]] for 41 years and a member of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.protothema.gr/culture/article/781570/alert-efuge-apo-ti-zoi-o-aggelos-delivorias-proin-dieuthudis-tou-mouseiou-benaki/ Έφυγε από τη ζωή ο Άγγελος Δεληβορριάς στα 81 του] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Graduate in the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[University of Thessaloniki]], Angelos Delivorrias graduated from the [[University of Freiburg]] in Germany in 1956. In 1965 he was appointed to the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] and served at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]. In 1973, he graduated from the [[University of Sorbonne]] at the [[École pratique des hautes études]]. A year later he was assigned the direction of the Benaki Museum in Athens, where he recommended immediately a radical regeneration that was completed after 27 years. In 1992 he was professor of Art History at the Department of Theater Studies of the School of Philosophy of the [[University of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatre.uoa.gr/didaktiko-dynamiko/omotimoi-ka8hghtes/aggelos-delhborrias.html Άγγελος Δεληβορριάς Ομότιμος καθηγητής, Διευθυντής Μουσείου Μπενάκη] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was honored by the Academy of Athens with its Silver Medal, while the Benaki Museum was awarded the "Gold Medal". On 31 October 2014, at an event held in the main building of the Museum, he announced his departure from the post of director, now occupying a seat in the Administrative Committee of the Foundation. In June 2016 he was elected as full member of the Academy of Athens, in the archeology-museology department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/culture/article/?aid=806645 Ο Αγγελος Δεληβοριάς τακτικό μέλος της Ακαδημίας Αθηνών.

== Director of Benaki Museum ==
Delivorrias managed to attract the interest of many donors and he realized a narrative process of development, consisting in the prominence of Greek civilization from antiquity to contemporary art. According to himself, he was the longest-lasting internationally head of the Museum, but at the same time the manager, the fundraiser and the scientific officer, as well as the man who had undertaken all sorts of contacts with the administrative services of the Greek state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/europe/benaki-museum-director-struggles-with-budget-cuts.html Benaki Museum Director Struggles With Budget Cuts]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5334">The '''Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act''' of 1998 is an [[Alabama]] statute that criminalizes the sale of [[sex toy]]s.  The law has been the subject of extensive litigation and has generated considerable national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Jay. Women Fight Alabama Sex Toy Ban, ''Chicago Sun Times'', Feb 18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Judge Overturns Alabama's Sex Toy Ban, ''The New York Times, March 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== The statute ==

The statute was originally sponsored by State Senator [[Tom Butler (Alabama politician)|Tom Butler]] of [[Madison, Alabama]] as a measure to prohibit nude dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Challen.  Sex toys never 'focus of bill'. ''Huntsville Times'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It prohibits "any person to knowingly distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or offer or agree to distribute any obscene material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs for any thing of pecuniary value."&lt;ref name="Code of Alabama"&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/alabama/criminal-code/13A-12-200.2.html Code of Alabama - Title 13A: Criminal Code - Section 13A-12-200.2 - Distribution, possession with intent to distribute, production, etc., of obscene material prohibited; penalties; distribution of fines]&lt;/ref&gt; First-time offenders face a $10,000 fine and a year in prison, while repeat offenders can face up to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Code of Alabama"/&gt; Exemptions exist for "bona fide medical, scientific, educational, legislative, judicial or law enforcement purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Challen. State set to enforce ban on sex toys, ''Huntsville Times'' Oct 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The law's most outspoken backers have been a coalition of [[Christian right|Conservative Christians]] led by Dan Ireland of the Alabama Citizens' Action Program.  Ireland has defended the law on the grounds that "laws are made to protect the public" and "sometimes you have to protect the public against themselves."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lyman, Brian. Ban on sex toys targeted. ''Mobile Register'', Dec. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges ==

Sherri Williams, an adult novelty dealer, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] challenged the statute on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-02-22-toys_x.htm High court declines to review Alabama's sex-toys ban] ''USA Today'', February 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the precedent of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', finding a right to engage in consensual homosexual sex, also guaranteed a right to sell sex toys.  After initially winning their case, ''Williams vs. Alabama'', in federal district court, Williams lost appeals to the [[11th Circuit Court of Appeals|11th Circuit]].&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/30/us/national-news-briefs-federal-judge-overturns-alabama-s-sex-toy-ban.html National News Briefs; Federal Judge Overturns Alabama's Sex Toy Ban], ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;   The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

Ross Winner, the owner of Love Stuff, a chain store which sells sex toys, subsequently sued to have the statute declared unconstitutional under the Alabama Constitution.  Winner's position is that "a person should have the ability to come in and purchase a sexual device without having to have a reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Love-Stuff/rDqpEplHt0iO3X6ibdiLXA.cspx Love Stuff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230109/http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Love-Stuff/rDqpEplHt0iO3X6ibdiLXA.cspx |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against him on September 11, 2009, and the statute's ban is now in effect.

[[Alabama House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[John Rogers (Alabama politician)|John Rogers]] of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] has repeatedly introduced legislation to repeal the ban, but each bill has been defeated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, adult toys continue to be sold as novelty and educational items. Adult clothing is marketed as costumes.

== Public reaction ==

San Francisco radio personality Big Joe Lopez held a protest outside the federal courthouse in Huntsville, Alabama, giving away sex toys to passersby.&lt;ref&gt;Faulk, Kent.  San Francisco Radio Personality Protests Sex Toy Ban, ''Birmingham News'', Feb. 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toy drive ===

In 2007, Alabama politician [[Loretta Nall]], a former [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate for governor, launched a well-publicized "toy drive" to send sex toys to Alabama Attorney General [[Troy King]], a staunch defender of the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Image:Engineer at audio console at Danish Broadcasting Corporation.png|right|thumb|An audio engineer at an audio console.]]
An '''audio engineer''' (also sometimes '''recording engineer''') helps to produce a [[sound recording|recording]] or a live performance, balancing and adjusting sound sources using [[equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[Effects unit|audio effects]], [[Live sound mixing|mixing]], reproduction, and [[Sound reinforcement system|reinforcement]] of sound. Audio engineers work on the "...technical aspect of recording—the placing of [[microphone]]s, [[pre-amp]] knobs, the setting of levels. The physical recording of any project is done by an engineer&amp;nbsp;... the nuts and bolts."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Phil_Ek_Interview.html |title=Interview with Phil Ek |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=25 May 2009 |accessdate=Sep 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a creative hobby and profession where musical instruments and technology are used to produce [[sound]] for [[film]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[music]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careerplanning.about.com/od/occupations/p/audio_engineer.htm|title=Audio Engineer|author=Dawn Rosenberg McKay|work=About.com Careers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audio engineers also set up, sound check and do [[live sound mixing]] using a [[mixing console]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for music concerts, theatre, sports games and corporate events.

Alternatively, '''audio engineer''' can refer to a [[scientist]] or professional [[engineer]] who holds an engineering degree and who designs, develops and builds audio or musical technology working under terms such as [[acoustical engineering]], [[Electrical engineering|electronic/electrical engineering]] or (musical) [[signal processing]].&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{cite web|last=wiseGeek|title=What Is Audio Engineering?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-audio-engineering.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
[[Research and development]] audio engineers invent new technologies, equipment and techniques, to enhance the process and art of audio engineering.&lt;ref name="soundonsound.com"&gt;Daley, Dan, [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct04/articles/rocketscience.htm "The Engineers Who Changed Recording: Fathers Of Invention"], ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; They might design acoustical simulations of rooms, shape algorithms for [[audio signal processing]], specify the requirements for [[public address]] systems, carry out research on audible sound for [[video game console]] manufacturers, and other advanced fields of audio engineering. They might also be referred to as acoustic engineers.&lt;ref name="University of Salford"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Graduate Jobs in Acoustics|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=roles|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You|url=http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225726/http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2017-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{See also|Category:Audio engineering schools}}

Audio engineers working in [[research and development]] may come from backgrounds such as [[acoustics]], [[computer science]], [[broadcast engineering]], [[physics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[electronics]]. Audio engineering courses at university or college fall into two rough categories: (i) training in the creative use of audio as a sound engineer, and (ii) training in [[science]] or [[engineering]] topics, which then allows students to apply these concepts while pursuing a career developing audio technologies.  Audio training courses give you a good knowledge of technologies and their application to [[recording studio]] and [[sound reinforcement system]]s, but do not have sufficient mathematical and scientific content to allow you to get a job in research and development in the audio and acoustic industry.&lt;ref name="acoustics.salford.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|first=Acoustics|title=Physics and music technology degrees|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=physics-music-technology-degree|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RogStudioLongshot.jpg|thumb|Noted audio engineer [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]] at a vintage Neve recording console.]]

Audio engineers in [[research and development]] usually possess a [[bachelor's degree]], [[master's degree]] or higher qualification in [[acoustics]], [[physics]], [[computer science]] or another [[engineering]] discipline. They might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in [[architectural acoustics]].&lt;ref name="National Careers"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles: Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively they might work in audio companies (e.g. [[headphone]] manufacturer), or other industries that need audio expertise (e.g., [[automobile]] manufacturer), or carry out research in a university. Some positions, such as [[faculty (academic staff)]] require a [[Doctor of Philosophy]]. In [[Germany]] a ''Toningenieur'' is an audio engineer who designs, builds and repairs audio systems.

===Sub-disciplines===
The listed subdisciplines are based on PACS ([[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]]) coding used by the [[Acoustical Society of America]] with some revision.&lt;ref name="Acoustical Society of America"&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=PACS 2010 Regular Edition—Acoustics Appendix|url=http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111126/http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio signal processing====
Audio engineers develop [[audio signal processing]] algorithms to allow the electronic manipulation of audio signals. These can be processed at the heart of much audio production such as [[reverberation]], [[Auto-Tune]] or perceptual coding (e.g. [[mp3]] or [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]]). Alternatively, the algorithms might carry out [[echo cancellation]] on [[Skype]], or identify and categorize audio tracks through [[Music Information Retrieval]] (e.g., [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]]).&lt;ref name="Pohlmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlmann|first=Ken|title=Principles of Digital Audio, Sixth Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-166347-2|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architectural acoustics====
[[File:AcousticDiscsRoyalAlbertHall.JPG|thumb|Acoustic diffusing mushrooms hanging from the roof of the [[Royal Albert Hall]].]]

[[Architectural acoustics]] is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a room.&lt;ref name="Morfey 2001 32"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; For audio engineers, architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a stadium or enhancing the quality of music in a theatre.&lt;ref name="Templeton 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Templeton|first=Duncan|title=Acoustics in the Built Environment: Advice for the Design Team|year=1993|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn=978-0-7506-0538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural Acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.&lt;ref name="National Careers" /&gt;

====Electroacoustics====
{{See also|Sound reinforcement system}}
[[File:Glastofriday2003.jpg|thumb|The Pyramid Stage]]

Electroacoustics is concerned with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound reproduction systems and recording technologies.&lt;ref name="ASA" /&gt; Examples of electroacoustic design include portable electronic devices (e.g. [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable media player]]s, and [[tablet computer]]s), sound systems in [[Architectural Acoustics|architectural acoustics]], [[surround sound]] and [[wave field synthesis]] in [[movie theater]] and [[vehicle audio]].

====Musical acoustics====
[[Musical acoustics]] is concerned with researching and describing the science of music. In audio engineering, this includes the design of electronic instruments such as [[synthesizers]]; the human voice (the [[physics]] and [[neurophysiology]] of [[singing]]); [[physical modeling]] of musical instruments; [[room acoustics]] of concert venues; [[music information retrieval]]; [[music therapy]], and the perception and cognition of [[music]].&lt;ref name="Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics TCMU of the Acoustical Society of America ASA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics (TCMU) of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) |url=http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/ |title=ASA TCMU Home Page |deadurl=yes |accessdate=22 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010613120620/http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/ |archive-date=2001-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bader"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bader |first1=Rolf |editor1-last=Bader |editor1-first=Rolf |title=Springer Handbook of Systematic Musicology |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-662-55004-5 |pages=25-28 |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-55004-5#toc |accessdate=23 November 2018 |ref=rb |chapter=Musical Acoustics and Signal Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoacoustics====
[[Psychoacoustics]] is the scientific study of how humans respond to what they hear. At the heart of audio engineering are listeners who are the final arbitrator as to whether an audio design is successful, such as whether a [[binaural recording]] sounds immersive.&lt;ref name="Pohlmann" /&gt;

====Speech====
The production, computer processing and perception of [[speech]] is an important part of audio engineering. Ensuring speech is transmitted intelligibly, efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through mobile telephone systems are important areas of study.&lt;ref name="Speech Communication Technical Committee"&gt;{{cite web|last=Speech Communication Technical Committee |title=Speech Communication |url=http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/ |publisher=Acoustical Society of America |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604013140/http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/ |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioner==
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Congress Warsaw (963).jpg|thumb|[[Live sound mixing]]]]

A variety of terms are used to describe audio engineers who install or operate [[sound recording]], [[sound reinforcement]], or sound [[broadcasting]] equipment, including large and small format [[Mixing console|consoles]]. Terms such as "audio technician," "sound technician," "audio engineer," "audio technologist," "recording engineer," "sound mixer" and "sound engineer" can be ambiguous; depending on the context they may be synonymous, or they may refer to different roles in audio production. Such terms can refer to a person working in sound and music production; for instance, a "sound engineer" or "recording engineer" is commonly listed in the credits of commercial music recordings (as well as in other productions that include sound, such as movies). These titles can also refer to technicians who maintain professional audio equipment. Certain jurisdictions specifically prohibit the use of the title [[engineer]] to any individual not a registered member of a professional [[engineering]] licensing body.

In German, the "Tontechniker" (audio technician) is the one who operates the audio equipment and the "Tonmeister" (sound master) is a person who creates recordings or broadcasts of music, who is both deeply musically trained (in classical and non-classical genres), and who also has a detailed theoretical and practical knowledge of virtually all aspects of sound.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Education and training===
{{See also|Category:Audio engineering schools}}
Audio engineers come from backgrounds or postsecondary training in fields such as audio, [[fine arts]], [[broadcasting]], [[music]], or [[electrical engineering]]. Training in audio engineering and [[sound recording]] is offered by colleges and universities. Some audio engineers are [[autodidact]]s with no formal training, but who have attained professional skills in audio through extensive on-the-job experience.

==Training and background==

Audio engineers must have extensive knowledge of audio engineering principles and techniques. For instance, they must understand how audio signals travel, which equipment to use and when, how to mic different instruments and amplifiers, which microphones to use and how to position them to get the best quality recordings. In addition to technical knowledge, an audio engineer must have the ability to problem solve quickly. The best audio engineers also have a high degree of creativity that allow them to stand out amongst their peers. In the music realm, an audio engineer must also understand the types of sounds and tones that are expected in musical ensembles across different genres - [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] for example. This knowledge of musical style is typically learned from years of experience listening to and mixing music in recording or live sound contexts. For education and training, there are audio engineering schools all over the world. In [[North America]], the most notable being [[Full Sail University]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]], [[United States]], and [[OIART]] (The [[Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology]]) in [[London, Ontario|London]], Canada.

In the [[recording studio]] environment, a sound engineer records, edits, manipulates, mixes, or [[Audio mastering|masters]] sound by technical means to realize the creative vision of the artist and [[record producer]].  While usually associated with music production, an audio engineer deals with sound for a wide range of applications, including [[post-production]] for [[video]] and [[film]], live sound reinforcement, [[advertising]], [[multimedia]], and broadcasting. In larger productions, an audio engineer is responsible for the technical aspects of a sound recording or other audio production, and works together with a record producer or director, although the engineer's role may also be integrated with that of the producer. In smaller productions and studios the sound engineer and producer are often the same person.

In typical sound reinforcement applications, audio engineers often assume the role of [[Record producer|producer]], making artistic and technical decisions, and sometimes even scheduling and budget decisions.&lt;ref name="Huber, D.M. 1995"&gt;Huber, D.M. (1995). ''Modern Recording Techniques''. (5th ed.). Burlington, MA: Focal Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role of women====
According to [[Women's Audio Mission]] (WAM), a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco dedicated to the advancement of [[women in music]] production and the recording arts, less than 5% of the people creating sound and media are women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the [[Grammys]]" and none won either award.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19284058|title=Why are female record producers so rare?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Women who want to enter the [producing] field face a boys' club, or a [[guild]] mentality".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The UK "Music Producers' Guild says less than 4% of its members are women" and at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, "...only 6% of the students enrolled on its sound technology course are female."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Women's Audio Mission was started in 2003 to address the lack of women in professional audio by training over 6,000 women and girls in the recording arts and is the only professional recording studio built and run by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=PPFA&amp;sw=w&amp;u=mlin|title=Gale - User Identification Form|website=Go.galegroup.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recording projects include the Grammy Award-winning [[Kronos Quartet]], [[Angelique Kidjo]] (2014 Grammy winner), author [[Salman Rushdie]], the Academy Award-nominated soundtrack to “Dirty Wars”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/54-2105425|title=Womens Audio Mission - GuideStar Profile|website=Guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van-Ahn Vo (NPR’s top 50 albums of 2013), Grammy-nominated [[St. Lawrence Quartet]], and [[world music]] artists [[Tanya Tagaq]] and [[Wu Man]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923-2004). [[Trina Shoemaker]] is a mixer, [[record producer]] and [[sound engineer]] who became the first woman to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album]] in 1998 for her work on ''[[The Globe Sessions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women, Music, Culture: An Introduction |last= Dunbar |first= Julie C.  |year= 2010 |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis  |isbn= 0415875625 |page= 304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gail Davies]] was the '...first female producer in [[country music]], delivering a string of Top 10 hits in the '70s and '80s including "[[Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You]]," "[[Blue Heartache]]" and "[[I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)]]." &lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/women-account-for-less-than-5-percent-of-producers-and-engineers-andmdash-but-maybe-not-for-long/Content?oid=1597594|title=Women account for less than 5 percent of producers and engineers — but maybe not for long - Cover Story - Nashville Scene|work=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she moved to [[Nashville]] in 1976, men "...didn't want to work for a woman" and she was told women in the city were "...still barefoot, pregnant and [singing] in the vocal booth." &lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

[[Wendy Waldman]], who became a producer after Davies, saw that Davies had a difficult time. When Jonell Polansky arrived in Nashville in 1994, with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and recording experience in the Bay Area, she was told "...[y]ou're a woman, and we already had one"–a reference to Waldman.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
KK Proffitt, who is a studio "owner and chief engineer" states that men in Nashville do not want to have women in the recording booth. At a meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]], Proffitt was told to "shut up" by a male producer when she raised the issue of updating studio recording technologies.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; Proffitt said she finds "...finds sexism rampant in the industry".&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

Other notable women include:
 
*[[Sylvia Robinson]], early [[hip hop music]] producer
*[[Susan Rogers]], engineer for ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]''
*[[Genya Ravan]], producer [[The Dead Boys]]' ''[[Young, Loud and Snotty]]'';
*[[Delia Derbyshire]], British electronics pioneer
*[[Lari White]], a co-producer on [[Toby Keith]]'s ''White Trash With Money''
*[[Leslie Ann Jones]]

===Sub-disciplines===
There are four distinct steps to commercial production of a recording: recording, editing, mixing, and mastering. Typically, each is performed by a sound engineer who specializes only in that part of production.
*Studio engineer – an engineer working within a studio facility, either with a producer or independently.
*Recording engineer – engineer who records sound.
*Assistant engineer – often employed in larger studios, allowing them to train to become full-time engineers.  They often assist full-time engineers with microphone setups, session breakdowns and in some cases, rough mixes.&lt;ref name="Huber, D.M. 1995"/&gt;				
*[[Mixing engineer]] –  a person who creates mixes of multi-track recordings. It is common to record a commercial record at one studio and have it mixed by different engineers in other studios.
*[[Mastering engineer]] – the person who masters the final mixed stereo tracks (or sometimes a series of audio stems, which consists in a mix of the main sections) that the mix engineer produces. The mastering engineer makes any final adjustments to the overall sound of the record in the final step before commercial duplication. Mastering engineers use principles of equalization, [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and [[Limiter|limiting]] to fine-tune the sound timbre and dynamics and to achieve a louder recording.
* Audio/sound designer – broadly an artist who produces sound tracks or sound effects content for media.					
*Live sound engineer
**Front of House (FOH) engineer, or A1.&lt;ref name="Front of House FOH Engineer"&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/front-house-foh-engineer "Front of House (FOH) Engineer"], ''Get in Media'' Entertainment Careers&lt;/ref&gt; – a person dealing with [[Live sound mixing|live sound reinforcement]]. This usually includes planning and installation of loudspeakers, cabling and equipment and mixing sound during the show. This may or may not include running the [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback sound]].  A live/sound reinforcement engineer hears source material and tries to correlate that sonic experience with system performance.&lt;ref name="Davis, G. 1990"&gt;Davis, G., Jones R. (1990). ''Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook''. (2nd ed.) Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;		
**Wireless microphone engineer, or A2. This position is responsible for wireless microphones during a theatre production, a sports event or a corporate event.
**Foldback or [[Monitor engineer]] – a person running foldback sound during a live event. The term "foldback" comes from the old practice of "folding back" audio signals from the [[front of house]] (FOH) mixing console to the stage so musicians can hear themselves while performing. Monitor engineers usually have a separate audio system from the FOH engineer and manipulate audio signals independently from what the audience hears so they can satisfy the requirements of each performer on stage. In-ear systems, digital and analog mixing consoles, and a variety of speaker enclosures are typically used by monitor engineers. In addition most monitor engineers must be familiar with wireless or RF (radio-frequency) equipment and must communicate personally with the artist(s) during each performance.
**Systems engineer – responsible for the design setup of modern PA systems, which are often very complex. A systems engineer is usually also referred to as a "crew chief" on tour and is responsible for the performance and day-to-day job requirements of the audio crew as a whole along with the FOH audio system. This is a sound-only position concerned with implementation, not to be confused with the interdisciplinary field of [[system engineering]], which typically requires a college degree.
*[[Re-recording mixer]] – a person in [[post-production]] who mixes audio tracks for [[feature films]] or [[television program]]s.

===Equipment===
[[Image:Roomcorrect-mag.png|thumb|Correcting a room's frequency response.]]

An audio engineer is proficient with different types of recording media, such as analog tape, digital multi-track recorders and workstations, and computer knowledge. With the advent of the digital age, it is increasingly important for the audio engineer to understand software and hardware integration, from synchronization to analog to digital transfers. In their daily work, audio engineers use many tools, including:
*[[Tape machine]]s
*[[Analog-to-digital converter]]s
*[[Digital-to-analog converter]]s
*[[Digital audio workstation]]s (DAWs)
*[[Dynamic range compression|Dynamic range compressors]]
*[[Data compression#Audio|Audio data compressors]]
*[[Music sequencer]]s
*[[Signal processor]]s
*[[Microphone]]s
*[[Preamplifier]]s
*[[Mixing console]]s

'''Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar''' (14 April 1891&amp;nbsp;– 6 December 1956), popularly known as '''Babasaheb Ambedkar''', was an Indian [[jurist]], [[economist]], [[politician]] and [[Social Reformer|social reformer]] who inspired the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] and campaigned against social [[discrimination]] towards the [[Untouchability|untouchables]] (''[[Dalit]]s''), while also supporting the rights of women and [[Labour movement|labour]].&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|title=Rescuing Ambedkar from pure Dalitism: He would've been India's best Prime Minister|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106214027/http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|archivedate=6 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"&gt;Bryant, Edwin.

Ambedkar was a prolific student earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]] and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics, and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar's time as a scholar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/hindi/india/zee-jankari-important-facts-of-dr-bhimrao-ambedkar/288606|title=Zee जानकारी : किसने रची थी डॉ. अंबेडकर के बारे में भ्रम फैलाने की साजिश|date=2016-04-15|work=Zee News Hindi|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he converted to [[Buddhism]] initiating mass conversions of Dalits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

In 1990, the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.

==Early life==
[[File:Pictures of Dr Ambedkar's parents - Ramji Ambedkar and Bhimabai.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Ambedkar parents [[Ramji Maloji Sakpal]] (father) and Bhimabai Sakpal (mother)]]

Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of [[Mhow]] (now [[Dr. Ambedkar Nagar]]) in the [[Central Provinces]] (now in [[Madhya Pradesh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |title = Ambedkar and Untouchability: Fighting the Indian Caste System|year= 2005 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-231-13602-0 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 14th and last child of [[Ramji Maloji Sakpal]], an army officer who held the rank of [[Subedar]], and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| title = In the 1890s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907040421/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| archivedate= 7 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Ambedkar family|family]] was of [[Marathi people|Marathi]] background from the town of [[Ambadawe]] ([[Mandangad|Mandangad taluka]]) in [[Ratnagiri (district)|Ratnagiri district]] of modern-day [[Maharashtra]]. Ambedkar was born into a poor low [[Mahar]] ([[dalit]]) caste, who were treated as [[Untouchability|untouchables]] and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357931/Mahar |title=Mahar |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130060042/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357931/Mahar |archivedate=30 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the [[British East India Company]], and his father served in the [[British Indian Army]] at the Mhow cantonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahuja|first=M.

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".&lt;ref name = "Waiting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|others= Frances Pritchett, translator |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa|first= B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&amp;nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&amp;nbsp;– and two daughters&amp;nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&amp;nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school.

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, his marriage to a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]].&lt;ref name="Columbia2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| title = In the 1900s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106043617/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| archivedate = 6 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming the first untouchable to do so. In his book, ''The Buddha and his Dhamma'', that when he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.&lt;ref name="Columbia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/00_pref_unpub.html unpublished preface of "The Buddha and his Dhamma"], cite 5th para&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.&lt;ref name="Columbia3"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| title = In the 1910s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123170145/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| archivedate = 23 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, Ambedkar moved to the United States at the age of 22. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in Economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar teacher|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India&amp;nbsp;– A Historic and Analytical Study'', for another M.A., and finally he received his PhD in Economics in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|title=Bhimrao Ambedkar|work=columbia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his third thesis, after he left for London. On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.&lt;ref name="Columbia3" /&gt; He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"/&gt; In 1922, he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn and In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics. His third and fourth Doctorates (LL.D, Columbia, 1952 and D.Litt., Osmania, 1953) were conferred ''honoris causa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wx218EFVU8MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=ambedkar%20D'Litt#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20D'Litt|title=Dalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956|first=Rāmacandra|last=Kshīrasāgara|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

==Opposition to untouchability==
[[File:Ambedkar Barrister.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a barrister in 1922]]
As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, ''[[Waiting for a Visa]]''.&lt;ref name="Rewriting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Dr. B.R.|title=Waiting for a Visa|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|website=columbia.edu|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=15 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624202609/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|archivedate=24 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keer |first1=Dhananjay |title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission |year=1971 |origyear=1954 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Mumbai |isbn=978-8171542376 |oclc=123913369 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he became Professor of Political Economy in the [[Sydenham College|Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics]] in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Ian |editor-last= Harris |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rwiLKm3LGUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ambedkar+discriminated+at+Sydenham+College+of+Comme#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20discriminated%20at%20Sydenham%20College%20of%20Comme |title=Buddhism and politics in twentieth-century Asia |publisher=Continuum International Group |isbn= 9780826451781 |date= 2001-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate [[electoral district|electorates]] and [[reservation in India|reservations]] for untouchables and other religious communities.&lt;ref name=Tejani&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejani|first=Shabnum|title=Indian secularism : a social and intellectual history, 1890-1950|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0253220448|pages=205–210|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xtrPKa59j4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22ambedkar%22+%22+Southborough+Committee%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ambedkar%22%20%22%20Southborough%20Committee%22|accessdate=17 July 2013|chapter=From Untouchable to Hindu Gandhi, Ambedkar and Depressed class question 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly ''Mooknayak'' (''Leader of the Silent'') in Mumbai with the help of [[Shahu of Kolhapur]] i.e. Shahu IV (1874–1922).&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the Doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission|last=Keer|first=Dhananjay|date=1995|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788171542376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5u9hDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=7 Reformers who Change the World|last=Mookherji|first=Kalyani|date=101-01-01|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution [[Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha]], intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "[[Dalit|outcastes]]", at the time referred to as depressed classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |title=Dr. Ambedkar |accessdate=12 January 2012 |publisher=National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008195805/http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |archivedate=8 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the defence of Dalit rights, he started five periodicals - ''Mooknayak'' (the leader of the dumb, 1920), ''Bahishkrit Bharat'' (Ostracized India, 1924), ''Samta'' (Equality, 1928), ''Janata'' (The People, 1930), and ''Prabuddha Bharat'' (Enlightened India, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/07/ambedkars-journalism-and-its-significance-today/|title=Ambedkar’s journalism and its significance today|date=2017-07-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|title=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|website=velivada.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand17/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-42-45/9964-2012-06-14-09-33-10?showall=&amp;start=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prahaar.in/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC/|title=पत्रकार डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर {{!}}|website=prahaar.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahamtb.com/Encyc/2017/12/6/Article-on-journalist-babasaheb-Ambedkar-by-ravindra-gole.html|title=पत्रकार आंबेडकर|website=mahamtb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Kamble, Rajeev|date=2002-12-31|title=Dr Ambedkar as a journalist a study|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/104917|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beedlive.com/newsdetail?cat=Madhyam&amp;id=2046&amp;news=%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89.%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE.html|title=डॉ.बाबासाहेब आंबेडकरांची आदर्श पत्रकारिता|website=beedlive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahanews.gov.in/Home/FrontMantralayDetails.aspx?str=utYf/MWKOh8=|title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर एक बहुआयामी व्यक्तीमत्त्व - डॉ. गंगाधर पानतावणे|website=mahanews.gov.in|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led a ''[[Mahad Satyagraha|satyagraha]]'' in [[Mahad]] to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar |accessdate=26 December 2010 |publisher=Maharashtra Navanirman Sena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041016/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the [[Manusmriti]] (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at [[Kalaram Temple]] satygraha making one of the greatest processions of [[Nashik]]. The procession was headed by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men walked in discipline, order and determination to see the god for the first time.

[[Gandhi]] fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poona Pact – 1932|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|website=Britannica.com|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073354/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambekar vs Gandhi: A Part That Parted|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Outlook|date=20 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427033738/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum to showcase Poona Pact|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=25 September 2007|quote=Read 8th Paragraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017053453/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]] of [[Poona]]. Following the fast, Congress politicians and activists such as [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and [[Palwankar Baloo]] organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omvedt |first1=Gail |year=2012 |title=A Part That Parted |journal=Outlook India |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812003046/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929 |archivedate=12 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 1932, the agreement known as [[Poona Pact]] was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]] earlier proposed by British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The text uses the term "Depressed Classes" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.&lt;ref name="sharma2007"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Introduction to the Constitution of India|work=google.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222319/https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|isbn=9788120332461|last1=Sharma|last2=Sharma|first2=B.

In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the [[Government Law College, Bombay]], a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of [[Ramjas College]], University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecampusconnect.com/7-interesting-historical-facts-about-ramjas-college-university-of-delhi/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.&lt;ref name="Columbia5"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| title = In the 1930s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906055230/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| archivedate= 6 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Columbia5"/&gt; He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the [[Independent Labour Party (India)|Independent Labour Party]], which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

After the [[Lahore resolution]] (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that ''Thoughts on Pakistan'' "rocked Indian politics for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the [[Partition of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |number=2 |year=2014 |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |p=73–76 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402094202/http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dhulipala |first=Venkat |title=Creating a New Medina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z6TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2 |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-05212-3 |ref={{sfnref|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015}} |pp=124,&amp;nbsp;134,&amp;nbsp;142–144,&amp;nbsp;149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.&lt;ref name="Firstpost 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Attention BJP: When the Muslim League rescued Ambedkar from the 'dustbin of history' | website=Firstpost | date=15 April 2015 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | accessdate=5 September 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920032027/http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | archivedate=20 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao Ramji|title=Pakistan or the Partition of India|year=1946|publisher=Thackers Publishers|location=Bombay|chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation|chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|pages=215–219|accessdate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912185829/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition to Aryan invasion theory==
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"/&gt;

Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"/&gt;}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 851.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 854-5, 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting India's Constitution==

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first Law Minister, which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |work=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title = The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |first= Granville |last= Austin |year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Constituent Assembly Debates Clause wise Discussion on the Draft Constitution 15th November 1948 to 8th January 1949|url=http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|accessdate= 12 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143208/http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|archivedate= 24 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.&lt;ref name=Sheth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

===Opposition to Article 370===
Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India, which granted a special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.&lt;ref name=Jamanadas&gt;{{cite web |last=amanadas |first=Dr. K. |title=Kashmir Problem From Ambedkarite Perspective |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |publisher=ambedkar.org |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225153/http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had [[neuropathic pain]] in his legs, and was taking [[insulin]] and homoeopathic medicines. He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Dr. Sharada Kabir, whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi. She was 39 year old and he was 57.

Ambedkar considered converting to [[Sikhism]], which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes.

A '''base pair''' ('''bp''') is a unit consisting of two [[nucleobase]]s bound to each other by [[hydrogen bond]]s.  They form the building blocks of the [[DNA]] double helix and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and [[RNA]]. Dictated by specific [[hydrogen bond]]ing patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs ([[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its [[nucleotide sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sequence-Dependent Variability of B-DNA | doi=10.1007/0-387-29148-2_2 | journal=DNA Conformation and Transcription |pages=18–34|year=2005 |last1=Zhurkin |first1=Victor B | last2=Tolstorukov | first2=Michael Y | last3=Xu | first3=Fei | last4=Colasanti | first4=Andrew V | last5=Olson | first5=Wilma K | isbn=978-0-387-25579-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of this based-paired structure provides a redundant copy of the [[genetic information]] encoded within each strand of DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which [[DNA polymerase]] replicates DNA and [[RNA polymerase]] transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

Intramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., [[transfer RNA]]), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-[[uracil]]) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional [[RNA structure|structures]]. In addition, base-pairing between [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) forms the basis for the [[molecular recognition]] events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming [[Genetic code|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of [[protein]]s via the [[genetic code]].

The size of an individual [[gene]] or an organism's entire [[genome]] is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of [[telomere]]s). The [[haploid]] [[human genome]] (23 [[chromosome]]s) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion bases long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct protein-coding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran |first=Laurence A. |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-big-is-human-genome.html |title=The total size of the human genome is very likely to be ~3,200 Mb |publisher=Sandwalk.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicgenomics.com/Genome/index.htm |title=The finished length of the human genome is 2.86 Gb |publisher=Strategicgenomics.com |date=2006-06-12 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHSGC2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931–45 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15496913 | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/full/nature03001.html| bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kilobase]] (kb) is a unit of measurement in [[molecular biology]] equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Organization of the ribosomal RNA genes of dictyostelium discoideum: Mapping of the nontrascribed spacer regions | last1 = Cockburn | first1 = Andrew F. | last2 = Jane Newkirk | first2 = Mary | last3 = Firtel | first3 = Richard A. | date = 1976 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSN-4C8GBDB-4Y/2/0c09db014fb73f4a8e0f3b5af596da01 | journal = Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 605–613 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(76)90043-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of related [[DNA]] base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;

&lt;div style="border: none; width:282px;"&gt;&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;Top, a '''G.C''' base pair with three [[hydrogen bond]]s. Bottom, an '''A.T''' base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the bases are shown as dashed lines. The wiggly lines stand for the connection to the pentose sugar and point in the direction of the minor groove. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[[Hydrogen bond]]ing is the chemical interaction that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the "right" pairs to form stably. DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. But, contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly; stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.&lt;ref name="Yakovchuk2006"&gt;Peter Yakovchuk, Ekaterina Protozanova and Maxim D. Frank-Kamenetskii. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkj454 Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix]. Nucleic Acids Research 2006 34(2):564–574.&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[nucleobase]]s, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called [[purine]]s; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called [[pyrimidine]]s. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine-purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. Purine-pyrimidine base pairing of AT or GC or UA (in RNA) results in proper duplex structure. The only other purine-pyrimidine pairings would be AC and GT and UG (in RNA); these pairings are mismatches because the patterns of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in [[RNA]] (see [[wobble base pair]]).

Paired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature, but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a [[Dna melting|melting point]] that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of [[extremophile]] organisms such as ''[[Thermus thermophilus]]'' are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-[[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see [[TATA box]]). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing  [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for [[PCR]] reactions.

===Examples===
The following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the [[5' end]] to the [[3' end]]; thus, the bottom strand is written 3' to 5'.

==Base analogs and intercalators==

{{Main|Nucleic acid analogues}}
Chemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly [[point mutation]]s) in [[DNA replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|DNA transcription]]. This is due to their [[isosteric]] chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is [[5-bromouracil]], which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its [[enol]] form.

Other chemicals, known as [[DNA intercalation|DNA intercalators]], fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce [[frameshift mutation]]s by "masquerading" as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large [[polyaromatic]] compounds and are known or suspected [[carcinogen]]s. Examples include [[ethidium bromide]] and [[acridine]].

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==
{{See also|Artificial gene synthesis|Expanded genetic code|Nucleic acid analogue|Synthetic genomics}}
An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or [[nucleobase]]) of [[DNA]] which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature.  DNA sequences have been described which use newly created nucleobases to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T ([[adenine]] – [[thymine]]) and G-C ([[guanine]] – [[cytosine]]).  A few research groups have been searching for a third base pair for DNA, including teams led by [[Steven A. Benner]], [[Philippe Marliere]], [[Floyd Romesberg]] and [[Ichiro Hirao]].&lt;ref name="Fikes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/|title=Life engineered with expanded genetic code|last=Fikes|first=Bradley J.|date=May 8, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=8 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001048/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/|archivedate=9 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some new base pairs have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zunyi|date=August 15, 2011|title=Amplification, Mutation, and Sequencing of a Six-Letter Synthetic Genetic System|journal=J.

In 1989 Steven Benner (then working at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich) and his team led with modified forms of cytosine and guanine into DNA molecules ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Enzymatic incorporation of a new base pair into DNA and RNA | last1 = Switzer | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Moroney | first2 = Simon E. | last3 = Benner | first3 = Steven A. | date = 1989 | journal = J.

Since then, Benner's team has been trying to engineer cells that can make foreign bases from scratch, obviating the need for a feedstock.&lt;ref name="Ewan"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/living-organism-artificial-dna_n_5283095.html |title=Scientists Create First Living Organism With 'Artificial' DNA| last=Callaway| first=Ewan |date=May 7, 2014| work=Nature News| publisher=Huffington Post| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Ichiro Hirao's group in Japan developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in transcription and translation, for the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirao | first1 = I. | display-authors = etal   | date = 2002 | title = An unnatural base pair for incorporating amino acid analogs into proteins | journal = Nat.

In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP).&lt;ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Efficient and sequence-independent replication of DNA containing a third base pair establishes a functional six-letter genetic alphabet |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=24 July 2012 |last=Malyshev |first=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Quach |first3=Henry T. |last4=Lavergne |first4=Thomas |last5=Ordoukhanian |first5=Phillip |volume=109 |issue=30 |pages=12005–12010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205176109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/30/12005 |accessdate=2014-05-11 |bibcode=2012PNAS..10912005M |pmid=22773812 |pmc=3409741}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named [[d5SICS]] and [[dNaM]]. More technically, these artificial [[nucleotide]]s bearing hydrophobic [[nucleobase]]s, feature two fused [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic rings]] that form a (d5SICS–dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA.&lt;ref name="Ewan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507" /&gt; His team designed a variety of ''in vitro'' or "test tube" templates containing the unnatural base pair and they confirmed that it was efficiently replicated with high fidelity in virtually all sequence contexts using the modern standard ''in vitro'' techniques, namely [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification of DNA]] and PCR-based applications.&lt;ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724"/&gt; Their results show that for PCR and PCR-based applications, the d5SICS–dNaM unnatural base pair is functionally equivalent to a natural base pair, and when combined with the other two natural base pairs used by all organisms, A–T and G–C, they provide a fully functional and expanded six-letter "genetic alphabet".&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt;

In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a [[plasmid]] containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations.&lt;ref name="Fikes"/&gt; The [[transfection]] did not hamper the growth of the ''E. coli'' cells and showed no sign of losing its unnatural base pairs to its natural [[DNA repair]] mechanisms. This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Malyshev |first=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Lavergne |first3=Thomas |last4=Chen |first4=Tingjian |last5=Dai |first5=Nan |last6=Foster |first6=Jeremy M. |last7=Corrêa |first7=Ivan R. |last8=Romesberg |first8=Floyd E. |title=A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13314.html |date=May 7, 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature13314 |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |pmid=24805238 |pmc=4058825 |volume=509 |issue=7500 |pages=385–8|bibcode=2014Natur.509..385M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sample"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/living-organism-pass-down-artificial-dna-us-scientists| title=First life forms to pass on artificial DNA engineered by US scientists| last=Sample|first=Ian|date=May 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romesberg said he and his colleagues created 300 variants to refine the design of nucleotides that would be stable enough and would be replicated as easily as the natural ones when the cells divide.  This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive [[Algae|algal gene]] that expresses a [[Nucleoside triphosphate|nucleotide triphosphate]] transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into ''E. coli'' bacteria.&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt; Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate a [[plasmid]] containing d5SICS–dNaM. Other researchers were surprised that the bacteria replicated these human-made DNA subunits.&lt;ref name = "fox" /&gt;

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of [[amino acid]]s which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Fikes"/&gt; The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses.&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html?hpw&amp;rref=business&amp;_r=0| title=Scientists Add Letters to DNA’s Alphabet, Raising Hope and Fear |last=Pollack| first=Andrew| date=May 7, 2014| work=New York Times| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts said the synthetic DNA incorporating the unnatural base pair raises the possibility of life forms based on a different DNA code.&lt;ref name = "fox"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/05/08/scientists-create-organism-using-artificial-dna/| title=Scientists create first living organism containing artificial DNA| date=May 8, 2014| work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Fox News| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pollack" /&gt;

==Length measurements==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[KB]] --&gt;
The following abbreviations are commonly used to describe the length of a D/R[[DNA|NA molecule]]:
* bp  = base pair(s)—one bp corresponds to approximately 3.4 [[Angstrom|Å]] (340 [[picometre|pm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Morgan|first4=David|last5=Raff|first5=Martin|last6=Roberts|first6=Keith|last7=Walter|first7=Peter|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=December 2014|publisher=Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=New York/Abingdon|isbn=978-0-8153-4432-2|page=177|edition=6th|ref=alberts_mboc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of length along the strand, and to roughly 618 or 643 [[Atomic mass units|daltons]] for DNA and RNA respectively.
* kb (= kbp) = kilo base pairs = 1,000 bp
* Mb (= Mbp) = mega base pairs = 1,000,000 bp
* Gb = giga base pairs = 1,000,000,000 bp.

For single-stranded DNA/RNA, units of [[nucleotide]]s are used—abbreviated nt (or knt, Mnt, Gnt)—as they are not paired.
To distinguish between units of [[computer storage]] and bases, kbp, Mbp, Gbp, etc. may be used for base pairs.

The [[centimorgan]] is also often used to imply distance along a chromosome, but the number of base pairs it corresponds to varies widely. In the Human genome, the centimorgan is about 1 million base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Glossary.aspx?acronym=False#C |title=NIH ORDR – Glossary – C |publisher=Rarediseases.info.nih.gov |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew P Scott|author2=Paul Matsudaira|author3=Harvey Lodish|author4=James Darnell|author5=Lawrence Zipursky|author6=Chris A Kaiser|author7=Arnold Berk|author8=Monty Krieger |title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=Fifth |publisher=W.

A '''Beltian body''' is a detachable tip found on the pinnules of some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' and closely related genera. Beltian bodies, named after [[Thomas Belt]], are rich in lipids, sugars and proteins and often red in colour. They are believed to have evolved in a symbiotic relationship with [[ant]]s. The ants live inside special plant structures ([[Domatia]]) or near the plant and keep away [[herbivore]]s.

[[Image:TEMET_HV_Blast_Damper.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Blast Damper with integral grill to shield against flying objects]]
A blast damper is used to protect occupants and equipment of a structure against [[overpressure]]s resultant of an explosion. The blast dampers normally protect air inlets and exhaust penetrations in an otherwise hardened structure. Blast dampers are related or identical to [[blast valve]]s, the latter name is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices as they relate to nuclear explosions.

==Operation==
Blast dampers usually employ some type of blade held open with tension from a spring. The damper blades close automatically when pressure overcomes the resistance offered by the spring. Various models differ in the amount of blast protection (e.g. 1bar/14.5psi or lower amounts of protection) and whether they stay closed after the blast or remain functional.

==Design==
Typical blast dampers are sized to match [[HVAC]] ductwork and provide proper airflow with low [[pressure drop]]. Common applications include protecting equipment and personnel of control rooms and accommodation modules in petrochemical and [[industrial process]] facilities onshore and offshore. Acid- and [[corrosion]]-resistant versions are often requested in these instances.

== History ==

30 years ago the Bonne Bay Marine Station was a small field station of [[Memorial University]]. The original station was a 2-storey house. The top floor had a small kitchen, a living room and three small bedrooms. The main floor had two larger rooms that were converted into labs and a small bathroom that was converted into a chemical lab where radioactive work and the chemical work was performed. It had a full basement, and there was an old fish store as a second building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/documents/Newsletter_Western_Shorefast-Issue_3_for_Email.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bob Hooper first visited the Bonne Bay area then and was taken with its breathtaking beauty, amazing marine biodiversity, and potential as a prime location for teaching and research. He helped convert this outport house with a fishing store into a marine teaching and research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer teaching activities began in 1979 with a single two week program. By 2001 seven, two week academic programs were running from mid April to September. The student demand for courses, and high level of research interest, often exceeded the available space. In addition, local visitors and summer tourists were frequently "dropping in" to view the aquarium, and learn about the latest research ventures. The existing station could no longer accommodate the needs for the facility. A new teaching and research facility plan was developed.

The official opening of the new Bonne Bay Marine Station occurred September 6, 2002. Built on the site of the old station this $3.2 million facility was funded by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; the Gros Morne Co-operating Association; the Department of Industry, Trade and Rural Development, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador; and Memorial University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CURRA ==

The Community-University Research for Recovery Alliance (CURRA) is a 5-year research program centered at Bonne Bay Marine Station. This program of innovative, interdisciplinary research projects is helping communities and organizations along Newfoundland's west coast develop strategies for the recovery of fish stocks and fishery communities.

The CURRA brings together researchers from the social and natural sciences and fine arts at Memorial University in St. John's and [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]] in working partnerships with numerous stakeholders and community organizations.

The long-term objectives of the CURRA include promoting community engagement with the Station, promoting and diversifying the research community affiliated with the Station and training researchers in collaborative, community-based research approaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/about_us.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cell culture assay''' is any method which is used to assess the [[cytotoxicity]] of a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A cell culture assay for the detection of cardiotoxicity|journal=Journal of pharmacological methods|volume=25|issue=2|pages=133–45|pmid=1712416|year=1991|author1=Löw-Friedrich|first1=I|last2=von Bredow|first2=F|last3=Schoeppe|first3=W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the ''[[in vitro]]'' assessment of a material to determine whether it releases toxic chemicals in sufficient quantities to kill cells either directly or indirectly through the inhibition of cell metabolic pathways.  Cell culture evaluations are the precursor to whole animal studies and are a way to determine if significant cytotoxicity exists for the given material.  Cell culture assays are standardized by [[ASTM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and BSI ([[British Standards Institution]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Critical hours''' for radio stations is the time from [[sunrise]] to two hours after sunrise, and from two hours before [[sunset]] until sunset, local time. During this time, certain American radio stations may be operating with reduced power as a result of Section 73.187 of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s rules.&lt;ref name="FCCamtext"&gt;{{cite web | title =AM Engineering Data Base for Public Release | work =AM Engineering Data Base  | publisher=FCC Mass Media Bureau, Audio Services Division (United States Government) | date =1997-04-21 | url =http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Databases/pre-cdbs-before-2000/amtext.txt | format=TEXT |dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930094523/http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Databases/pre-cdbs-before-2000/amtext.txt | archivedate=2007-09-30 | accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian restricted hours''' are similar to critical hours, except that the restriction results from the January 17, 1984, U.S.-Canadian AM Agreement. Canadian restricted hours are called "critical hours" in the U.S.-Canadian Agreement, but in the AM Engineering database, the FCC calls them "Canadian restricted hours" to distinguish them from the domestically defined critical hours. Canadian restricted hours is that time from sunrise to one and one-half hours after sunrise, and from one and one-half hours before sunset until sunset, local time. U.S. stations operate with restricted hours because of Canadian stations, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="FCCamtext"/&gt;

Those radio stations that must lower their power during the critical hours are required to do so because this is when the propagation of radio waves changes from [[groundwave]] to [[skywave]] (at sunset) or vice versa (at sunrise).  This can cause radio stations to be picked up much farther away, possibly causing interference with other stations on the same frequency or adjacent frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Edmunds | first=Russ | title=Sunrise &amp; Sunset | publisher=National Radio Club | url=http://www.nrcdxas.org/articles/sunriseset.html | dead-url=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104235902/http://www.nrcdxas.org/articles/sunriseset.html | archivedate=2006-11-04 | accessdate=2016-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually stations operating under the restrictions of Critical Hours must sign off the air between the end of the evening critical hours and the beginning of the morning critical hours.  In effect, permission to operate during critical hours gives daytime-only stations a few more hours in their broadcast day.  This is especially important in autumn and winter, when these stations might otherwise need to be off the air during the important morning and afternoon drive times, when AM radio listening is at its highest.

'''Customer support''' is a range of [[customer service]]s to assist customers in making cost effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/customer-support.html|title=What is customer support? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding technology products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed [[technical support]].&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"/&gt;

Customer support is considered as one of the main data channels for [[customer satisfaction research]] and a way to increase [[customer retention]].

==Automation==&lt;!--[[Support automation]] redirects here--&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

[[Automation]] of service organizations aim to achieve, for example, lower [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR).

Customer support automation involves the building of a [[knowledge base]] of known [[issue (computers)|issue]]s and their resolution to support [[incident management|incident]]s with delivery mechanisms, often by [[expert system]]s. A service automation platform includes a suite of support solutions including proactive support, assisted support and self-support. 

With automated support, service organizations can make their services available to their customers [[24/7|24 hours a day and 7 days a week]], by monitoring [[alarm]]s, identifying problems at an early stage and resolving issues before they become problems. Automated assisted support enables remote access to sites that need instant problem solving. By automating the collection of information of devices and applications coexisting with the supported application, problems can be quickly detected and fixed. 

Automated self-support, automates the self-support process, freeing users from self-help diagnostics and troubleshooting from [[digital library|on-line libraries]] or knowledge bases.
Support automation solutions can be integrated with [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[network management system]]s (NMS), and provide full customer reports to management tallying problems and incidents that were solved mechanically ensuring compliance to industry regulations like [[Sarbanes Oxley]], [[Title 21 CFR Part 11|21 CFR part 11]], and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]].

===Types===
*'''Proactive Support Automation''' refers to support automation solutions that minimize downtime and enable 24x7 [[availability]]. This is achieved by constant health check tracking with diagnostic procedures to enable issue monitoring and problem solving.
*'''Preemptive Support Automation''' refers to a support solution that utilizes information that is either generated or culled from an application or service, e.g. log files, database queries, configuration changes, etc. This information can then be exploited to predict service degradations or interruptions. The upshot of this is a higher level of service/application availability for the underlying application
*'''Self Support Automation''' is the term organizations give to their support structures that provide on-line libraries and tools for self-help and easy troubleshooting solutions to automatically and precisely diagnose and resolve problems and incidents.
*'''Assisted Support Automation''' is the software that enables support personnel to remotely access their customers desktop or server for diagnostics and trouble ticket resolution.

==Communication Channels==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Channels of communication that companies may offer to customers for support:

; Phone support
: Customers speak directly to customer support representatives over the phone. For inbound calls, an IVR (Integrated Voice Response) can be programmed to route captured calls in a variety of ways with the potential goal of quickest resolution of a customer’s request/problem.
: Phone Support is often used for order taking, pre-sales queries, upselling and [[cross-selling]], troubleshooting etc.
: Outbound calls are calls made to customers from the [[call center]] to give or take information. 
; Live chat support
: With live chat support a web visitor seeks assistance, a text chat session is started by clicking on a link on the provider's website. The customer support representative interacts with the web visitor, understands the requirements, resolves the query and closes the interaction. Alternatively, based on the requirements the customer support representative could also trigger a chat session with the web visitor. Live chat support assists with language barriers as both parties involved in the chat session may be able to use an online translation service to communicate. It is also considered less intrusive than phone support.{{POV-statement|date=December 2014}}  Live chat support is often used for lead generation and fulfillment, campaign management, pre-sales and post-sales enquiries, complaint registration, tech support etc.
; Email support
: Email is the primary means to offer web-based assistance for your customers when matters do not require an immediate answer. Low-cost, non-intrusive and anywhere-anytime access are some of the advantages of email-based communications. Trouble Ticketing System and CRM Applications help keep track of a series of follow-up correspondence with a particular customer. Services offered via email response management is claims processing, polling/media analysis, subscription services, troubleshooting, complaint registrations etc.
; Remote support
: Solving problems of a computer at a particular location from a computer at another location is remote support. Companies can save considerable amounts of money on logistics through remote support. IT technicians are empowered with several tools that allow them to gain access to customers’ computers at various parts of the world. They are able to gain access and repair software related problems from remote locations. The need for a technician to visit the customers’ premises is mitigated. With the movement of applications from the desktop to the cloud, newer forms of browser based remote support have developed such as [[Cobrowsing]].
; On-site support
: On-site support is the opposite of remote support. Certain kinds of assistance cannot be rendered remotely, like, hardware related problems. repairing a TV, replacing a spare part, servicing of air conditioners etc. In some occasions, a service provider might choose to take devices or gadgets back to their warehouse for repair.
; Social media
: Since the arrival of social media platforms like [[Facebook]] &amp; [[Twitter]], service providers have found that many of their customers spend plenty of time on them daily. To make it convenient to customers, many service providers have set up a [[webcare]] team as support channel on their social media profiles. Customers are able to ask questions, register complaints, clarify doubts etc. by interacting with the company’s staff through these social media platforms. With millions of users now gaining access to social media, this platform has become as prominent as traditional media like phone, live chat and email.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7695">'''Cyanide fishing''' is a method of collecting live fish mainly for use in [[aquarium]]s, which involves spraying a [[sodium cyanide]] mixture into the desired fish's habitat in order to stun the fish. The practice hurts not only the target population, but also many other marine organisms, including [[coral]] and [[coral reef]]s.

==History and geography==
Cyanide fishing is practiced mainly in [[seawater|saltwater]] fishing regions of Southeast Asia. Since the practice was never widely publicized or officially approved, its origins are uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in the 1950s in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Dzombak, David A; Ghosh, Rajat S; Wong-Chong, George M. ''Cyanide in Water and Soil''. [[CRC Press]], 2006, Chapter 11.2: "Use of Cyanide for Capturing Live Reef Fish".&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the twentieth century the practice was adopted by some fishing outfits in Indonesia, Thailand, Maldives, and Taiwan, among others.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Cyanide fishing was initially developed to stun and capture fish for [[aquarium]]s and collectors, but it was soon used for catching food fish as well. It is [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal]] in many of the countries in which it is practiced, although these laws are often minimally enforced.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; [[Grouper]], [[wrasse]], and [[coral trout]] are among the more popular species of fish captured through cyanide fishing.

The [[World Resources Institute]] determined that approximately 20% of the live fish traded on the Philippine market in 1996 were caught using cyanide; assuming this is reflective of southeast Asian practice as a whole, environmental engineer David Dzombak estimates that 12,000 to 14,000 tons of live food fish are caught each year using this method.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;

Colourful, particularly eccentric, and therefore rare [[coral fish]] are packed into plastic bags; up to two thirds of these fish die during transport. Estimates suggest 70 to 90% of [[aquarium fish]] exported from the Philippines are caught with cyanide.&lt;ref name="Wabritz"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wabritz, C. |author2=Taylor, M. |author3=Green, E. |author4=Razak, T. | year=2003| title=From Ocean to Aquarium| journal=Unep-Wcmc| pages=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barber, C.V. |author2=Pratt, R.V. |year=1998| title=Poison and profits: cyanide fishing in the Indo-Pacific|journal=Environment| volume=40| pages=5–34| doi=10.1080/00139159809604600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McManus, J. W. |author2=Reyes, R.B. |author3= Nanola, C.L. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1997| title=Effects of some destructive fishing practices on coral cover and potential rates of recovery|journal=Environmental Management| volume=21|issue=1|pages=69–78| doi=10.1007/s002679900006|pmid=8939786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the post-capture handling stress and the effects of the cyanide, fish are bound to have a shorter life span than usual in aquariums. According to an interview with experienced aquarium owners, they were willing to pay more for net-caught fish because of the higher survival rate.&lt;ref name="Tsang"&gt;{{cite web | title=A glance at the marine aquarium fish trade in Hong Kong. | work=Tsang, A. | url=http://www.hku.hk/ecology/porcupine/por24/24-vert-fish.htm | accessdate=May 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also said they would not trust an [[ecolabel]]ling system, which can be misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The basis for this [[illegal fishing]] method is, among others, the rising demand for [[live fish trade|live fish]] in the higher-class restaurants of the big cities, particularly in rich, nearby countries, which pay increasingly high prices. The extremely low wages of the fishermen in remote, underdeveloped areas, where there are no alternative sources of income, drive them to endure the health risks and possible prosecution.

==Method==
The fishermen dive into the sea usually without artificial breathing aids, although some use a highly dangerous apparatus (commonly garden hose surface-fed from the type of [[air compressor]] commonly used to power [[jackhammer]]s). When they reach the [[coral reef]]s, they spray the poison between the individual layers, after which the yield is collected. Edible fish, of which a number are sold for general consumption, are first placed for ten to fourteen days in fresh water for "rinsing". Recent studies have shown that the combination of cyanide use and stress of post capture handling results in [[Fish mortality|mortality]] of up to 75% of the organisms within less than 48 hours of capture. With such high mortality numbers, a greater number of fish must be caught in order to supplement post-catch death.

Cases have been reported of fishermen dumping drums of concentrated cyanide in places where fishing is difficult or economic times are hard.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Such high concentrations normally kill most of the haul, but in these cases the objective is no longer to catch live fish, but to catch the largest amount possible.

==Mechanism==
In seawater sodium cyanide breaks down into sodium and cyanide [[ion]]s. In humans, cyanides block the oxygen-transporting protein [[haemoglobin]]; the haemoglobin in fish is closely related to that of humans, and can combine with oxygen even faster{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. Through the irreversible combining of cyanide ions onto the active [[structural domain]], oxygen is prevented from reaching the cells, and an effect similar to [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning results. [[Coral polyp]]s, young fish and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] are most vulnerable; adult fish can take somewhat higher doses. The use of cyanide is known to cause mortality on laboratory [[coral]]s in measured doses, however these data are very difficult to quantify in regard to wild populations.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.J.|year=1997|title=Zooxanthellae loss as a [[bioassay]] for assessing stress in corals| journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=149|pages=163–171|doi=10.3354/meps149163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans ingestion or breathing in of cyanide leads to unconsciousness within a minute; asphyxiation follows. Lower doses lead to temporary or permanent disability and/or sensory failure. This is a constant danger for the fishermen; there are many local accounts of such "occupational accidents", but such incidents are not recorded in official statistics or statements{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

==Habitat destruction==
Many fishing and diving areas across the whole of South East Asia, already severely damaged from the impact of [[dynamite fishing]], have been ruined or totally lost through cyanide fishing. Cyanide concentration slows [[photosynthesis]] in [[zooxanthellae]], which results in [[Coral bleaching|coral reefs losing color]]; it also eliminates one of their major food sources.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Even at very low doses, cyanide results in higher mortality levels among corals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''Device Description Language (DDL)''' is the formal language describing the service and configuration of field devices for process and factory automation.

== Background ==

Current field devices for process and factory automation have a number of configuration options, to customize them to their individual use case. For these means they are equipped with a digital communication interface ([[Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol|HART]], [[PROFIBUS]], [[Fieldbus Foundation]]). Different software tools provide the means to control and configure the devices. In the 1990s, the DDL was developed to remove the requirement to write a new software tool for each new device type. Software can, through the interpretation of a device description (DD), configure and control many different devices. The creation of a description with the DDL is less effort than writing an entire software tool.

The HART Communication Foundation, PROFIBUS and Fieldbus Foundation have merged their individual dialects of the DDL. The result became the ''Electronic Device Description Language (EDDL)'', an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard (IEC 61804).

The harmonization and enhancement of the EDDL is being undertaken in the EDDL Cooperation Team (ECT). The ECT consists of the leadership of the Fieldbus Foundation, Profibus Nutzerorganisation (PNO), Hart Communication Foundation, OPC Foundation and the FDT Group.

== Structure of the DDL ==

The DDL describes:
* Data (e.g. Parameters)
* Communication (e.g. Addressing Information)
* User Interfaces
* Operations (e.g. Calibration)

== Software ==

A device description (DD) can be created with a plain text editor. But like any other programing or description language, the authoring is error prone and as such special development tools may be used, to create valid and norm conforming EDDs.

The following tools assists the creation of EDDs:
* isEDD Workbench and EDD Checker ([http://eddl.ifak.eu/ ifak e.V. Magdeburg]) - Norm conformity to the IEC 61804 parts 3, 4 and 5

The following control and configuration tools interpret the DDL:
* [[SIMATIC]] PDM - "The Process Device Manager" ([[Siemens]])
* AMS Intelligent Device Manager([[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson Process Management]])
* SDC 625 (HART)  
* FDM ([[Honeywell]])
* isEDDview DTM (ifak system GmbH)
* iDTM für FieldCare ([[Endress+Hauser]])

'''Dissociative recombination''' is a process where a positive molecular ion recombines with an electron, and as a result, the neutral molecule dissociates.  This reaction is important for extraterrestrial and atmospheric chemistry. On [[Earth]], dissociative recombination rarely occurs naturally, as free electrons react with any [[molecule]] (even neutral molecules) they encounter. Even in the best laboratory conditions, dissociative recombination is hard to observe, but is an important reaction in systems that have large populations of ionized molecules, for instance in [[atmospheric-pressure plasma]]s.

In [[astrophysics]], dissociative recombination is one of the main paths via which molecules are broken down, and other molecules are formed. The existence of dissociative recombination is possible due to the [[vacuum]] of the [[interstellar medium]]. A typical example of dissociative recombination in astrophysics is:

:&lt;math&gt;CH_3^+ + e^- \rightarrow CH_2 + H &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Dolch word list''' is a list of frequently used [[English language|English]] words compiled by Edward William Dolch, a major proponent of the [[Whole-word method|"whole-word" method]] of beginning reading instruction. The list was first published in a journal article in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Dolch, E. W. "A Basic Sight Vocabulary." ''The Elementary School Journal'', vol. 36, no. 6, 1936, pp.456-460.&lt;/ref&gt; and then published in his book ''Problems in Reading'' in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Dolch, Edward William. ''Problems in Reading''. Garrard Press, 1948, pp.99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dolch compiled the list based on children's books of his era, which is why nouns such as "kitty" and "Santa Claus" appear on the list instead of more high-frequency words. The list contains 220 "service words" that have to be easily recognized in order to achieve reading fluency in the English language. The compilation excludes [[noun]]s, which comprise a separate 95-word list. Between 50% and 75% of all words used in schoolbooks, library books, newspapers, and magazines are a part of the Dolch basic [[sight word]] vocabulary.

These lists of words are still assigned for memorization in American elementary schools. Although most of the 220 Dolch words are phonetic, children are sometimes told that they can't be "sounded out" using common sound-to-letter [[analytical phonics|implicit]] [[phonics]] patterns and have to be learned by sight; hence the alternative term, "sight word". The list is divided according to the grades in which it was intended that children would memorize these words.

'''Engineering''' is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and [[empirical evidence]] to the [[innovation]], [[design]], [[construction]], operation and [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] of [[structure]]s, [[machine]]s, [[material]]s, devices, [[system]]s, [[process]]es, and [[organization]]s for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized [[List of engineering branches|fields of engineering]], each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of [[applied mathematics]], [[applied science]], and types of application. See [[glossary of engineering]].

The term ''engineering'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', meaning "cleverness" and  ''ingeniare'', meaning "to contrive, devise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IAENG|url=http://www.iaeng.org/about_IAENG.html|website=iaeng.org|publisher=International Association of Engineers|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley.

The term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1390 when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') referred to "a constructor of military engines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]
The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], [[Teotihuacán]], the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djosèr]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]–[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

[[Ancient Greece]] developed machines in both civilian and military domains.

Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] or [[epicyclic gearing]], two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [[gear train]]s of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as [[robotics]] and [[automotive engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century Military technology] Quote: "The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th." and "But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century. It was first heard of in the context of Sicilian warfare against Carthage in the time of Dionysius I of Syracuse."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[trireme]], the [[ballista]] and the [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[trebuchet]] was developed.

===Renaissance era===
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

===Modern era===
The science of [[classical mechanics]], sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |last=Musson |author2=Robinso|year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815-1860 |last=Taylor|first= George Rogers|year=1969 |publisher =|location=

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of [[civil engineering]]. He was an English [[civil engineer]] responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, [[canal]]s, [[harbour]]s, and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomn steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine.  The sequence of events began with the invention the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who  built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707.  [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]].  [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Rhys | authorlink = | title = Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times| publisher = Ayer Publishing| year = 1936 | location =| page = 66 | isbn = 978-0-8369-2167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron merchant [[Thomas Newcomen]], who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century.  The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical.  The [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.  [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.  With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New steel making processes, such as the [[Bessemer process]] and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

[[File:The world's first iron bridge.jpg|thumb|253px|The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges.  This bridge was made of [[cast iron]], which was soon displaced by less brittle [[wrought iron]] as a structural material]]

One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the  first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century.  These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position.  Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of "engineer" for the first time with a count of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-504605-2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875.  In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, [[mining]], mechanical and electrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907.  Germany established technical universities earlier.&lt;ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| edition =| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

Only a decade after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society – 1962 – Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

===Chemical engineering===
{{Main|Chemical engineering}}
[[Chemical engineering]] is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of [[commodity chemicals]], [[specialty chemicals]], [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[microfabrication]], [[fermentation]], and [[Biotechnology|biomolecule production]].

===Civil engineering===
{{Main|Civil engineering}}
[[Civil engineering]] is the design and construction of public and private works, such as [[infrastructure]] ([[airports]], [[roads]], [[railways]], water supply, and treatment etc.), [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |accessdate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archivedate=16 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/what-is-civil-engineering|title=What is Civil Engineering|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including [[structural engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[surveying]]. It is traditionally considered to be separate from [[military engineering]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica|url =https://www.britannica.com/technology/civil-engineering|title = Civil Engineering|last = Watson|first = J. Garth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical engineering===
{{Main|Electrical engineering}}
[[Electrical engineering]] is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[Broadcast engineering]], [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].

===Mechanical engineering===
{{Main|Mechanical engineering}}
[[Mechanical engineering]] is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, [[vibration isolation]] equipment, [[manufacturing]], and [[mechatronics]].

===Other branches===
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}
Beyond these "Big 4", a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],&lt;ref&gt;Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-2121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–48|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

A general methodology and [[epistemology]] of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.

According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what she produces, but rather how she goes about it.&lt;ref name="Discussion of The Method"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-515599-0|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem solving===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.

Usually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.{{Citation needed|reason=Kindly provide citation. Usually safety factor is considered to be a part of an efficient design.|date=October 2017}}

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;

The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archivedate=2006-10-06|deadurl =yes|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name="EMI"&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring.  This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archivedate=2014-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an "image crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career.  Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{quote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Canada, many engineers wear the [[Iron Ring]] as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Medicine and biology===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"/&gt; He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

[[File:GFP Mice 01.jpg|thumb|right|Genetically engineered mice expressing [[green fluorescent protein]], which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [[wild-type]].]]
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [[brain implant]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref name="Boston U"&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Bioe/BioeMcGe.htm Ethical Assessment of Implantable Brain Chips. Ellen M. McGee and G.Q. Maguire, Jr. from Boston University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE foreign parts"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2188/27125/01204814.pdf?arnumber=1204814 IEEE technical paper: Foreign parts (electronic body implants).by Evans-Pughe, C. quote from summary: Feeling threatened by cyborgs?]&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[bionics]] and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name="IME"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and [[empirical]] knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"&gt;[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational or mathematical modelling and experimentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011033/http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf |date=2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"/&gt;

===Art===

There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]] (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Engineering).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering: Professor uses the fine arts to broaden students' engineering perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT World:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ MIT World:The Art of Engineering: Inventor James Dyson on the Art of Engineering: quote: A member of the British Design Council, James Dyson has been designing products since graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1970.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232213/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas at Dallas"&gt;[http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ University of Texas at Dallas:  The Institute for Interactive Arts and Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], for instance, held an exhibition about the art of [[NASA]]'s aerospace design.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/nasa/overview.html Aerospace Design: The Art of Engineering from NASA's Aeronautical Research]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Maillart]]'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.&lt;ref name="Princeton U"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/137.html Princeton U: Robert Maillart's Bridges: The Art of Engineering: quote: no doubt that Maillart was fully conscious of the aesthetic implications&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of South Florida]], an engineering professor, through a grant with the [[National Science Foundation]], has developed a course that connects art and engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chief engineer"&gt;[http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm quote:..the tools of artists and the perspective of engineers..] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180822/http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"&gt;Bjerklie, David.  "The Art of Renaissance Engineering."  ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59.  Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician." (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew U"&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business Engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.

The '''Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail''' features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]]. The "trail offers an adventurous opportunity for heritage, recreational, and ecological tourism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Oriskany''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: The largest artificial reef in the world, this wreck was named a Top 25 U.S. Dive Site in 2014 by Scuba Diving magazine.
Depth: 80–212 feet
Sink Date: May 17, 2006
Nicknamed the "Great Carrier Reef," the USS Oriskany, also known as the "Mighty O," was sunk after serving in the Pacific and earning battle stars for service in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Located 22 miles off the coast of Pensacola and submerged in more than 200 feet of water, this shipwreck offers exploration for divers of all skills and a myriad of pelagic and sedentary marine life.

===''YDT-14''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: After years of training US Navy divers, this shipwreck is now a dive destination itself.
Depth: 90 feet
Sink Date: April 2000
Gulf storms have buried this diving tender to her decks, but the upper structure around 65 feet below sea level offers boundless exploration for divers.

===''San Pablo''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: This ship is steeped in a history of foreign spies, espionage and secret military operations.
Depth: 80 feet
Sink Date: August 11, 1944
Launched from Belfast, Ireland, in 1915, San Pablo started her life as a fruit transport running bananas from Central America to the United States. Early during World War II she was sunk by a U-boat in Costa Rica and refloated. In August 1944 amid rampant rumors of foreign spies and espionage, San Pablo exploded off Pensacola's coast, hence her local name "Russian Freighter." Recently declassified documents reveal that San Pablo was actually destroyed in a top-secret U.S. military operation testing an experimental weapon system. American agents sank the freighter with a radio-controlled boat carrying over 3,000 lbs. of explosives. Her wreckage is scattered across the seafloor where divers can explore boilers, refrigeration coils and huge sections of twisted metal, all home to an impressive array of marine life.

===''Pete Tide II''===

A push tug, Miss Louise sits upright in 60 feet of water, brimming with marine life and serving as a great site for novice and intermediate divers.

===''Black Bart''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Appliances {including the ship's toilet} remain intact in the Head and Galley, offering unique exploration for divers.
Depth: 85 feet
Sink Date: 1993
Sunk in memory of Navy Supervisor of Salvage Captain Charles "Black Bart" Bartholomew, this oilfield supply vessel remains largely intact with its wheelhouse {40 foot depth}, deck {66 foot depth} and open cargo holds {80 foot depth}.

===''Fami Tugs''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Mother Nature rearranged this artificial reef, picking up one of the two tugs and situating it on top of the other for a most unusual diving experience.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: 2003
Once resting bow-to-bow and joined by a 30-foot tether, a storm picked up one of the sunken tugs and placed it directly atop the other, allowing divers to enjoy two shipwrecks at once and serving as a reminder to visitors of the power of the sea.

===USS ''Accokeek''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: With more than 50 years of service around the world, this tug led an exciting career above water before her final destination to the ocean floor.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: July 9, 2000
After an impressive global run serving as a fleet tug, the USS Accokeek was repeatedly sunk and refloated for salvage and ordinance training at the Navy Dive School in Panama City, Fla.

Claim to Fame: Another testament to the swirls of the sea, this ship originally laid on her side at the ocean's floor before being righted by a hurricane in 1995.
Depth: 80 feet
Sink Date: May 19, 1987
A World War II minesweeper that survived a midget submarine attack and a kamikaze raid, the USS Strength offers divers a fascinating tour of a large artificial reef, including an impressive goliath grouper.

===USS ''Chippewa''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: This tugboat is known for breaking speed records during her U.S. Navy tenure.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: Feb. 8, 1990
Sunk as a Navy training platform for the Panama City Experimental Dive Unit in 1990, the USS Chippewa now sits upright on the bottom in 100 feet of water offering a great dive for spotting marine life.

===''Vamar''===

City: Port St. Joe, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Made famous as a support ship for Admiral Richard Byrd's 1928 Antarctic expedition, the Vamar sunk under mysterious circumstances.
Depth: 25 feet
Sink Date: March 21, 1942
Sunk under mysterious circumstances during a trip to carry lumber to Cuba in 1942, the Vamar now lies in just 25 feet of water, offering a large steam engine, bilge keels and a wide variety of marine life for divers and snorkelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail Media Kit|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/media-kit.html|website=floridapanhandledivetrail.com|publisher=Florida Public Archaeology Network|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mardi Gras Shipwreck===

In May 2007, an expedition, led by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and funded by the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC) under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study a wreck site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the OGGC. As part of the educational outreach [[Nautilus Productions]] in partnership with [[BOEM]], Texas A&amp;M University, the Florida Public Archaeology Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FPAN Home|url=http://www.flpublicarchaeology.org/|website=Florida Public Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Veolia Environmental produced a one-hour HD documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. The [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] was tasked with the conservation and analysis of the material recovered from the wreck site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation Mardi Gras Project|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/mardigras/|website=http://nautarch.tamu.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gary A. Rendsburg''' (born 1954) is a professor of biblical studies, Hebrew language, and ancient Judaism at [[Rutgers University – New Brunswick|Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/people/core-faculty/gary-a-rendsburg|title=Gary A. Rendsburg homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the rank of Distinguished Professor and serves as the Blanche and Irving Laurie Chair of Jewish History at Rutgers University (2004–present), with positions in the Department of Jewish Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/|title=Rutgers University, Department of Jewish Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.rutgers.edu/|title=Rutgers University, Department of History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to teaching at Rutgers, Rendsburg taught for 18 years at [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca, N.Y. (1986-2004) and for six years at [[Canisius College]] in Buffalo, N.Y. (1980-1986).

==Education==
Rendsburg received his B.A. degree in English and Journalism from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1975), and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Hebrew Studies from [[New York University]] (1977, 1980).

==Career==

===Research interests===

Rendsburg's main research interests are the literature of the Bible, the history of ancient Israel, the historical development of the Hebrew language, the relationship between ancient Egypt and ancient Israel, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and medieval Hebrew manuscripts. He also teaches courses and offers lectures on the whole breadth of Jewish history and religion, with a special focus on the development of Judaism in the post-biblical period.

====Hebrew dialects====

Rendsburg is best known for his work on [[Israelian Hebrew]], the dialect of ancient Hebrew used in the northern part of Israel (more or less contiguous with the territory of the kingdom of Israel, which existed 930-721 B.C.E.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/329-rendsburg-orient-comp-guide-ih/file|title=A Comprehensive Guide to Israelian Hebrew: Grammar and Lexicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Bruun Kofoed, ''Text and History: Historiography and the Study of the Biblical Text'' (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2005), pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron D. Hornkohl, ''Ancient Hebrew Periodization and the Language of the Book of Jeremiah: The Case for a Sixth-Century Date of Composition'' (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 17-22.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William M. Schniedewind, ''A Social History of Hebrew: Its Origins through the Rabbinic Period'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect stands in contrast to Judahite Hebrew, the dialect used in the southern part of the country (in Judah in general and in Jerusalem in particular), in which the vast majority of the biblical books are composed. While earlier scholars had postulated the existence of a northern Hebrew dialect, and had offered a few lexical and grammatical features as evidence thereto, Rendsburg greatly expanded our knowledge of Israelian Hebrew by identifying sections of the Bible written in the dialect and by creating a much longer list of linguistic traits specific to this dialect. He built his case based both on internal biblical evidence and on the fact that many Israelian Hebrew features occur in Phoenician, Moabite, and Aramaic, dialects and languages which border the territory of northern (and Transjordanian) Israel, but not Judah in the south.

Rendsburg further proposed that [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], a Hebrew dialect used in post-biblical times, especially for the composition of early rabbinic texts, was also a northern dialect of ancient Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/328-rendsburg-orient-mh-lexicon/file|title=The Geographical and Historical Background of the Mishnaic Hebrew Lexicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Zelig Aster, "Mishnah Baba Metsia 7:7 and the Relationship of Mishnaic Hebrew to Northern Biblical Hebrew," in Steven Fine and Aaron Koller, eds., ''Talmuda de-Eretz Israel: Archaeology and the Rabbis in Late Antique Palestine'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2014), pp. 1-18, esp. pp. 2-4.
&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that many Israelian Hebrew features continue in Mishnaic Hebrew; and he further observed that the [[Mishnah]] and related texts were compiled in [[Sepphoris]] or elsewhere in the [[Galilee]], so that the geography makes sense as well.

In his earlier work Rendsburg also addressed the question of [[diglossia]] in ancient Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eisenbrauns.com/item/RENDIGLOS|title=Diglossia in Ancient Hebrew|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scobie P. Smith, "The Question of Diglossia in Ancient Hebrew," in Stanley E. Porter, ed., ''Diglossia and Other Topics in New Testament Linguistics'' (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2000), pp. 35-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William M. Schniedewind, ''A Social History of Hebrew: Its Origins through the Rabbinic Period'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), pp. 19, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron D. Hornkohl, ''Ancient Hebrew Periodization and the Language of the Book of Jeremiah: The Case for a Sixth-Century Date of Composition'' (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 22-25.
&lt;/ref&gt; To his mind, Biblical Hebrew is essentially a literary dialect, used for the composition of texts, whereas spoken Hebrew in ancient Israel diverged in its morphology and syntax. Rendsburg used departures from the grammatical norm found in the Bible, along with parallels from other spoken Semitic languages (especially Arabic, but also Ethiopian), to reconstruct the spoken dialect of ancient Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/75-parallel-developments-in-mishnaic-hebrew-colloquial-arabic-and-other-varieties-of-spoken-semitic/file|title=Parallel Developments in Mishnaic Hebrew, Colloquial Arabic, and Other Varieties of Spoken Semitic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rendsburg also has contributed to the issue of diachrony in ancient Hebrew, with special attention to the differences between Standard Biblical Hebrew (of the pre-exilic period) and Late Biblical Hebrew (of the post-exilic period).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/45-late-biblical-hebrew-and-the-date-of-p/file|title=Late Biblical Hebrew and the Date of 'P'|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/500-lbh-haggai-huerhnergard-fs/file|title=Late Biblical Hebrew in the Book of Haggai|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Bruun Kofoed, ''Text and History: Historiography and the Study of the Biblical Text'' (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2005), pp. 143-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rendsburg's work on Qumran Hebrew accepts the theory advanced by [[William Schniedewind]], which holds that the main dialect of the Dead Sea Scrolls constitutes an [[anti-language]], a somewhat artificial construct used to distinguish the Essenes' Hebrew from that of other Jewish groups of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/396-qumran-hebrew-studies-on-the-texts-of-the-desert-of-judah/file|title=Qumran Hebrew (with a Trial Cut [1QS])|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/641-pesher-habakkuk-std-114/file|title=The Nature of Qumran Hebrew as Revealed through Pesher Habakkuk|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moshe J. Bernstein and Aaron Koller, "The Aramaic texts and Hebrew and Aramaic languages at Qumran: the North American contributions," in Devorah Dimant, ed., ''The Dead Sea Scrolls in Scholarly Perspective: A History of Its Research'' (Leiden: Brill, 2012), pp. 155-195, esp. pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

====A Challenge to the Documentary Hypothesis====

While Rendsburg accepts the obvious distinctions between the Priestly and Deuteronomic legal-cultic material in the Torah, he has argued for viewing the prose stories in the Torah as emanating from a single voice. In his view, the manifold interconnections between and among various passages within the prose accounts (for example, in the book of Genesis and in the Exodus account) bespeak a single narrative voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eisenbrauns.com/item/RENREDACTP|title=The Redaction of Genesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/649-literaryunityoftheexodusnarrative/file|title=The Literary Unity of the Exodus Narrative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor P. Hamilton, ''The Book of Genesis: Chapters 1-17'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1990), pp. 30-32; and Victor P. Hamilton, ''The Book of Genesis: Chapters 18-50'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1995), passim.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, "Pondering the Pentateuch: The Search for a New Paradigm," in David W. Baker and Bill T. Arnold, ''The Face of Old Testament Studies: A Survey of Contemporary Approaches'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1999), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach stands in contrast to the adherents of the [[Documentary hypothesis|Documentary Hypothesis]] (JEDP Theory), which holds that different passages in the narratives are to be ascribed to different sources (especially ''J'', ''E'' and ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;S. David Sperling, ''Students of the Covenant: A History of Jewish Biblical Scholarship in North America'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992), pp. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hebrew stylistics====

Rendsburg has written widely on a host of ancient Hebrew literary and stylistic devices, including wordplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/216-word-play-in-bh/file|title=Word Play in Biblical Hebrew: An Eclectic Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred G. E. Watson, ''Classical Hebrew Poetry: A Guide to Its Techniques'' (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[alliteration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/305-alliteration-shalom-paul-fs/file|title=Alliteration in the Exodus Narrative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/654-alliteration-in-genesis/file|title=Alliteration in the Book of Genesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shani Tzoref, "Israel's Development as a Nation: Form, Storm, Norm, Perform – How The Words נשא and נסע Structure the Book of Numbers," online at

====Egypt and Israel====

Rendsburg has contributed in two ways in this arena. First, he has addressed the question of the evidence for the Sojourn-Slavery-Exodus account, presented at the end of the book of Genesis and the beginning of the book of Exodus, and the dates thereof;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/80-the-date-of-the-exodus-and-the-conquest-settlement/file|title=The Date of the Exodus and the Conquest/Settlement: The Case for the 1100's|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/94-the-early-history-of-israel/file|title=The Early History of Israel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Chavalas and Murray R. Adamthwaite, "Archaeological Light on the Old Testament," in David W. Baker and Bill T. Arnold, ''The Face of Old Testament Studies: A Survey of Contemporary Approaches'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1999), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Davies, "Was There an Exodus?" in John Day, ed., ''In Search of Pre-Exilic Israel'' (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2004), pp. 36, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence T. Geraty, "Exodus Dates and Theories," in Thomas E. Levy, et al., eds., ''Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective'' (Berlin: Springer, 2015), pp. 62, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, he has shown how Egyptian literary, religious, and magical topoi resonate within the Moses story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/118-moses-as-equal-to-pharaoh/file|title=Moses as Equal to Pharaoh|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-04768-3|title=Moses the Magician|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brad C. Sparks, "Egyptian Texts relating to the Exodus: Discussions of Exodus Parallels in the Egyptology Literature," in Thomas E. Levy, et al., eds., ''Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective'' (Berlin: Springer, 2015), pp. 259-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval Hebrew manuscripts====

Rendsburg has developed three websites devoted to medieval Hebrew manuscripts:

The first (developed with Jacob Binstein) is devoted to the book of [[Sirach|Ben Sira]], whose documentary evidence ranges from [[Qumran]] and [[Masada]] in antiquity to the [[Cairo Genizah]] in the medieval period, and whose manuscripts are found in Cambridge, Oxford, London, Paris, Jerusalem, New York, and Los Angeles. Rendsburg and Binstein aggregated all of this material at a single website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bensira.org/|title=bensira.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that scholars now may inspect the diverse manuscripts more readily.&lt;ref&gt;Eric D. Reymond, "New Hebrew Text of Ben Sira Chapter 1 in MS A (T-S 12.863)," ''Revue de Qumran'' 27 (2015), pp. 83-98, esp. p. 84 and p. 85, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second (developed with Joshua Blachorsky) presents to the public an incomplete yet very valuable manuscript of the [[Mishnah]], known as JTS MS R1622.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jts-ms-r1622-1.org/|title=jts-ms-r1622-1.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Library of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]. Until the development of the website, the manuscript remained unpublished, though now scholars from around the world may access it via the internet.

The third (developed with Peter Shamah) reunites all of the documentary evidence from the [[Cairo Geniza]]h relevant to the life of [[Obadiah the Proselyte|Johannes of Oppido = Obadiah the Proselyte]] at a single website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://johannes-obadiah.org/|title=Johannes of Oppido {{!}} Home|website=johannes-obadiah.org|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documents include the Obadiah Memoir, the Epistle of R. Barukh of Aleppo, the Siddur that Obadiah wrote for himself, and his musical compositions (Hebrew prayers set to Gregorian chant).

Hartle and Hawking suggest that if we could travel backwards in time towards the beginning of the Universe, we would note that quite near what might otherwise have been the beginning, time gives way to space such that at first there is only space and no time. Beginnings are entities that have to do with time; because time did not exist before the [[Big Bang]], the concept of a beginning of the Universe is meaningless. According to the Hartle–Hawking proposal, the Universe has no origin as we would understand it: the Universe was a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] in both space and time, pre-Big Bang. Thus, the Hartle–Hawking state Universe has no beginning, but it is not the [[Steady State theory|steady state Universe]] of [[Fred Hoyle|Hoyle]]; it simply has no initial boundaries in time or space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawking|first=Stephen|title=The Beginning of Time|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TT-20180303"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dastidar |first=Samriddhi |title=Stephen Hawking Claims To Know What Happened Before The Big Bang |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/222309/20180303/stephen-hawking-claims-to-know-what-happened-before-the-big-bang.htm |date=3 March 2018 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=3 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LS-20180302"&gt;{{cite web |last=Specktor |first=Brandon |title=Stephen Hawking on What Happened Before the Big Bang |url=https://www.livescience.com/61914-stephen-hawking-neil-degrasse-tyson-beginning-of-time.html |date=2 March 2018 |work=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=3 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical explanation ==

The Hartle–Hawking state is the [[wave function]] of the Universe—a notion meant to figure out how the Universe started—that is calculated from [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[Path integral formulation|path integral]].

More precisely, it is a hypothetical [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] in the [[Hilbert space]] of a theory of [[quantum gravity]] that describes this [[wave function]].

It is a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the [[metric tensor]] defined at a (''D''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[compact surface]], the Universe, where ''D'' is the [[spacetime]] dimension. The precise form of the Hartle–Hawking state is the path integral over all ''D''-dimensional geometries that have the required [[induced metric]] on their boundary. According to the theory, [[time]], as it is currently observed, diverged from a three-state dimension after the Universe was in the age of the [[Planck time]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Barrow]], ''The Origin of the Universe: To the Edge of Space and Time'', Basic Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a wave function of the Universe can be shown to satisfy, approximately, the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]].

'''Ichthyology''' (from Greek: [[wikt:ἰχθύς|ἰχθύς]], ''ikhthys'', "fish"; and λόγος, ''logos'', "study"), also known as '''fish science''', is the branch of [[zoology]] devoted to the study of [[fish]].  This includes bony fish ([[Osteichthyes]]), cartilaginous fish ([[Chondrichthyes]]), and jawless fish ([[Agnatha]]). While a large number of species have been discovered, approximately 250 new species are officially described by science each  year. According to [[FishBase]], 33,400 species of fish had been described by October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]: [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php October 2016 Update.] Retrieved 7 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mimbres fish.jpg|thumb|Fish represent approximately 8% of all figurative depictions on [[Mimbres pottery]].|alt=Photo of square side of pottery showing fish with skewed checkered pattern on its skin. Zig-zag lines represent waves at the top and bottom.]]

The study of fish dates from the [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic Revolution]] (with the advent of "high culture"). The science of ichthyology was developed in several interconnecting epochs, each with various significant advancements.

The study of fish receives its origins from human's desire to feed, clothe, and equip themselves with useful implements. According to [[Michael Barton (professor)|Michael Barton]], a prominent ichthyologist and professor at [[Centre College]], "the earliest ichthyologists were hunters and gatherers who had learned how to obtain the most useful fish, where to obtain them in abundance, and at what times they might be the most available". Early cultures manifested these insights in abstract and identifiable artistic expressions.

===1500 BC–40 AD===
Informal, scientific descriptions of fish are represented within the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. The Old Testament laws of [[kashrut]] forbade the consumption of fish without scales or appendages.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Theologians]] and ichthyologists believe that the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and his contemporaries harvested the fish that are today sold in modern industry along the [[Sea of Galilee]], presently known as [[Lake Kinneret]]. These fish include [[cyprinid]]s of the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Barbus]]'' and ''[[Mirogrex]]'', [[cichlid]]s of the genus ''[[Sarotherodon]]'', and ''[[Mugil cephalus]]'' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mugilidae]].

=== 335 BC–80 AD ===

[[Aristotle]] incorporated ichthyology into formal scientific study. Between 335 BC–322 BC, he provided the earliest [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification of fish, accurately describing 117 species of [[Mediterranean]] fish. Furthermore, Aristotle documented [[anatomy|anatomical]] and behavioral differences between [[fish]] and [[marine mammal]]s. After his death, some of his pupils continued his ichthyological research. [[Theophrastus]], for example, composed a [[treatise]] on amphibious fish. The Romans, although less devoted to science, wrote extensively about fish. [[Pliny the Elder]], a notable Roman [[natural history|naturalist]], compiled the ichthyological works of indigenous [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s, including verifiable and ambiguous peculiarities such as the [[sawfish]] and [[mermaid]] respectively. Pliny's documentation was the last significant contribution to ichthyology until the [[European Renaissance]].

=== European Renaissance ===

The writings of three sixteenth century scholars, [[Hippolito Salviani]], [[Pierre Belon]], and [[Guillaume Rondelet]], signify the conception of modern ichthyology. The investigations of these individuals were based upon actual research in comparison to ancient recitations. This property popularized and emphasized these discoveries. Despite their prominence, Rondelet's ''[[De Piscibus Marinis]]'' is regarded as the most influential, identifying 244 species of fish.

=== 16th–17th century ===

The incremental alterations in navigation and shipbuilding throughout the Renaissance marked the commencement of a new epoch in ichthyology. The Renaissance culminated with the era of exploration and colonization, and upon the cosmopolitan interest in navigation came the specialization in naturalism. [[Georg Marcgrave]] of [[Saxony]] composed the ''Naturalis Brasilae'' in 1648. This document contained a description of 100 species of fish indigenous to the [[Brazil]]ian coastline. In 1686, [[John Ray]] and [[Francis Willughby]] collaboratively published ''[[Historia Piscium]]'', a scientific manuscript containing 420 species of fish, 178 of these newly discovered. The fish contained within this informative literature were arranged in a provisional system of classification.

[[File:Deckblatt zu einem der Hauptwerke von Peter Artedi.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from ''Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus'' by Peter Artedi]]
The classification used within the ''Historia Piscium'' was further developed by [[Carl Linnaeus]], the "father of modern taxonomy". His [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] approach became the systematic approach to the study of organisms, including fish. Linnaeus was a professor at the [[University of Uppsala]] and an eminent [[botany|botanist]]; however, one of his colleagues, [[Peter Artedi]], earned the title "father of ichthyology" through his indispensable advancements. Artedi contributed to Linnaeus's refinement of the principles of taxonomy. Furthermore, he recognized  five additional [[order (biology)|orders]] of fish: Malacopterygii, Acanthopterygii, Branchiostegi, Chondropterygii, and [[Plagiuri]]. Artedi developed standard methods for making counts and measurements of anatomical features that are modernly exploited. Another associate of Linnaeus, [[Albertus Seba]], was a prosperous [[pharmacist]] from [[Amsterdam]]. Seba assembled a cabinet, or collection, of fish. He invited Artedi to utilize this assortment of fish; unfortunately, in 1735, Artedi fell into an Amsterdam canal and drowned at the age of 30.

Linnaeus posthumously published Artedi's manuscripts as ''Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus'' (1738). His refinement of taxonomy culminated in the development of the [[binomial nomenclature]] which is in use by contemporary ichthyologists. Furthermore, he revised the orders introduced by Artedi, placing significance on [[pelvic fin]]s. Fish lacking this appendage were placed within the order Apodes; fish containing abdominal, thoracic, or jugular pelvic fins were termed Abdominales, Thoracici, and Jugulares respectively. However, these alterations were not grounded within evolutionary theory. Therefore, it would take over a century until [[Charles Darwin]] would provide the intellectual foundation from which we would be permitted to perceive that the degree of similarity in taxonomic features was a consequence of [[phylogenetic]] relationship.

=== Modern era ===

Close to the dawn of the nineteenth century, [[Marcus Elieser Bloch]] of [[Berlin]] and [[Georges Cuvier]] of [[Paris]] made attempts to consolidate the knowledge of ichthyology. Cuvier summarized all of the available information in his monumental ''[[Histoire Naturelle des Poissons]]''. This manuscript was published between 1828 and 1849 in a 22 volume series. This documental describes 4,514 species of fish, 2,311 of these new to science. It remains one of the most ambitious treatises of the modern world. Scientific exploration of the Americas advanced our knowledge of the remarkable [[diversity of fish]]. [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]] was a student of Cuvier. He made a cabinet of fish dwelling within the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]] regions.

Adventurous individuals such as [[John James Audubon]] and [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] figure in the faunal documentation of [[North America]]. These persons often traveled with one another. Rafinesque wrote ''[[Ichthyologia Ohiensis]]'' in 1820. In addition, [[Louis Agassiz]] of [[Switzerland]] established his reputation through the study of freshwater fish and the first comprehensive treatment of paleoichthyology, Poissons Fossiles. In the 1840s, Agassiz moved to the [[United States]], where he taught at [[Harvard University]] until his death in 1873.

[[Albert Günther]] published his ''[[Catalogue of the Fish of the British Museum]]'' between 1859 and 1870, describing over 6,800 species and mentioning another 1,700. Generally considered one of the most influential ichthyologists, [[David Starr Jordan]] wrote 650 articles and books on the subject as well as serving as president of [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] and [[Stanford University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">'''Information manipulation theory''' ('''IMT''') (McCornack 1992) &amp; (McCornack et al. 1992) is a way of looking at interpersonal communication. It deals with the way a  sender might assemble information packages (in the form of messages) to a receiver in order to give an impression that is false from the perspective of the sender. The sender chooses certain facts in the message from an available amount of information—but omits, alters, or falsifies others. The act of trying to get someone to believe something untrue is ''deceit''. The type of communication created by such deceitful intent is called a deceptive message. The senders management of given information to provide a receiver with a false perception of that same information is called ''information manipulation''. Departing from the focus on the communication mode found in [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT), IMT is more concerned with the content of the deceptive messages, the situational contexts that bring them about, the degree to which the detection of such a message affects perception of deception and the relational consequences associated with deceptive messages.

==History and central themes==

Information manipulation theory (IMT) was formulated by Steven A. McCornack while an assistant professor and a Lilly Endowment Teaching Fellow at Michigan State University. In 1992, McCornack published two articles that are recognized as the seminal works in information manipulation theory.  In his first article, McCornack lays out the basic foundation of this theoretical option for examining the phenomenon of creating and relaying deceptive messages. As stated, IMT “suggests that deceptive messages function deceptively because they violate the principles that govern conversational exchanges” (McCornack 1992). The second article (McCornack et al. 1992) provided an empirical test of the theory.

Timothy Levine (PhD, Michigan State University, 1992) was present for the first empirical test for information manipulation theory, has been a significant contributor to the development of IMT, and is a leader in developing new paradigms for [[deception]] detection research. IMT provided impetus to the development of a message-based theory of deception detection that calls into question psychophysical and emotion-based theories of deception detection as well as the interaction-based IDT.

==Operational context==

Information manipulation theory, not unlike [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) is a subset and functional manifestation of interpersonal communication. According to David Buller and Judee Burgoon, “Deception is conceptualized as a form of information management, something that is fundamental to human communication (Buller &amp; Burgoon 1998).”  IMT is concerned with the way that relational goals and situational pressures influence the interpersonal communication process, and ultimately leads to the formation and implementation of deceptive verbal messages.

==Conceptual foundation==

Prior to the introduction of information manipulation theory as a potential way to observe the phenomenon of verbally controlling information there was literature on the subject of information control and deception in general. McCornack cites Turner, Edgley and Olmstead (1975) and how they “noted several forms of information control in their study of conversations (e.g. “lies,” “exaggerations,” “half-truths,” “secrets,” and diversionary responses) (McCornack et al. 1992).”  Buller and Burgoon again draw upon Turner et al. when referring to deception as “a very common form of information management in human interaction (Buller and Burgoon 1998).” With the notion of deception already being established in circles of communication studies and behavioral science as a topic of discussion and analysis by the 1980s, we have the development of conceptual constructs regarding the topic. In 1984, Hopper and Bell introduce a typology of deceptive types using English terms. The types noted in McCornack’s work are listed as follows: unlies, playings, fiction, masks, lies, and crimes (McCornack et al. 1992). In another oft-cited work from the 1980s, we are given another typology. In 1986, Metts and Chronis proposed another four types and in 1989 Metts asserted that regardless of the differences in semantics, all the “taxonomies” to date reflected a similarity in the formulation of deceptive messages. Metts states “the observable variation in deceptive message design reflects “a continuum of covert to overt misrepresentation of information.” (McCornack et al., 1992) Finally, you have [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) introduced in 1988 by David Buller and Judee Burgoon, which proposes that deception is a distinct communicative process that relies on interaction between the sender and receiver. IDT focuses on emotion both as a motivator and message in the process as well as the mechanical aspects of how that communication takes place (Buller and Burgoon 1998).

==Theoretical perspective==

Information manipulation theory departs from [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] in the substance of the focus of its studies.  Whereas Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) spends more time studying the physiological challenges and channels of communication involved in the detection of deceptive messages, information manipulation theory is more involved with the content of the messages and why they are employed. This is a distinction that can be examined in terms of how these theories approach the divergence from communication norms. IDT is more involved with the physical and biological deviation of normal behavior exhibited in communication. IMT is more fixed on the departure from conversational standards. Both theories aimed at discovering more about the relational effect of discovering that an act of deception has taken place.

==Previous research==

Before the advent of information manipulation theory, researchers were not interested in the formulation or design of the deceptive message. Previous studies on deception were more concerned with the mode of communication because deception was thought to occur in typical human interactions in unnatural polarized ways. Additionally, use of recollection as a method generating “normal” cognitive examples of deception scenarios further led to this dichotomous perspective. Truth in communication was thought to be clear or unclear. Bavelas et al. (1990) speak to this issue (McCornack 1992). Deception was also viewed to have manifested as either one of two of things: a type or a strategy. McCornack sought to depart from that and present another argument for how deceptive messages might be analyzed. IMT recognizes deception as a unique mode of communication that departs from more traditional, rational communicative behavior. IMT is more directed at answering the question of how a sender might go about engaging in the development and dispensation of a deceptive message and what about that process makes it more or less deceptive (McCornack 1992).

==Theoretical framework==

Information manipulation theory proposes that in any given conversation there exists a set of basic, reasonable assumptions about how transmission of information occurs. This premise is based on the work of [[Paul Grice]]. Taken from his speeches in 1967 to writings in 1975 and 1989, Grice promoted notions regarding language usage that has come to be known as his theory of “conversational implicature” (CI) (McCornack 1992).
*''Conversational implicature''

Jacobs, Dawson and Brashers (1996) recount Grice stating “communication is made possible by communicators’ mutually orienting toward general principles of cooperation and rationality.” The vehicles that deliver CI are what Grice refers to as conversational maxims (CM).  CM can be used as dimensions to determine the degree of deceptiveness.

*''Conversational maxims''

These maxims are as follows:
# Quantity &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the reasonable amount of information that should be provided in a given message
# Quality &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the veracity (truthfulness) of information that is presented in a given message
# Relation &amp;mdash; relates to relevancy expectations regarding the constraints of the conversation established by earlier remarks
# Manner &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the way something is said
(McCornack 1992)

*''Cooperative principle''

Grice posits that the resulting ‘norm’ that arises from adherence to CM is by virtue of what is called the Cooperative Principle (CP).

These maxims are only totally adhered to in what is called ‘a philosopher’s paradise’ but generally these maxims can be adhered to within a conversational context. Grice calls the obvious real world violation of a CM as “flouts”; when one CM opposes another, this is referred to as a “clash” (Jacobs et al. 1996).  In the case of the former this violation can happen “quietly.”
 
It is a major tenet of IMT that the subtle and covert nature of these violations of conversational norm assumptions is precisely what makes a message deceptive. A message can be identified in terms of its deceptiveness dependent on where it is measured according to the dimensions of the conversational maxims (McCornack 1992).

==Major experimental findings==

* The initial experiments regarding information manipulation theory confirmed that the degree to which a message can be determined to be deceptive can be coded and measured along the dimensions of its violations of CM. The deception by the receiver is experienced when the CP understood to occur is not adhered to by the sender. This experiment also questioned the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure of available information compared to social goal or consequences (McCornack et al. 1992).
* The second set of experiments measure the effect of the dimensions compared to each other. It was discovered some violations were considered “more deceptive” than others. Another discovery was that the nature of the relationship has an effect on the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure. In regard to romantic relationships, full disclosure is more ‘competent’ because relational honesty was considered paramount (McCornack 1992).
* Another significant experiment was performed to see if the results of McCornack’s theory could be generalized outside of Western cultures. This was examined through the lens of the individualist vs. collectivist debate. These two cultural poles are regarded as the most overarching themes of cultural identity and perspective. With the U.S. regarded as being representative of the Individualist perspective, Hong Kong was chosen to represent the Collectivist perspective. The dimensions of quality and relevance were regarded as deceptive, but not the other dimensions.  This experiment concluded that what is seen as '''truthful'', what violations are acceptable, the motivation for those violations and what is understood to be a conversational maxim is dependent on cultural identity (Yeung, Levine, &amp; Nishiyama 1999).
* Another experiment performed by L. Zhou and S. Lutterbie followed the work of the aforementioned tests of IMT. This experiment concluded that the best way to apply the principles of IMT across cultures is to take a multi-directional, multi-prong approach. This subject of normative actions in conversation should be approached with a top-down and bottom-up approach (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).

==Influential factors==

*''Cultural concept''

IMT as it is applied in cultural contexts varies. When evaluating Western culture it was discovered that all methods of manipulation were viewed as deceptive with manipulation of quality rated as most deceptive.  Conversely, IMT participants in Hong Kong only rated statements involved with quality and/or relevance as more manipulative and deceptive (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).  Both researchers agree that the Bottom-Up approach is an effective method for examining general patterns of deception across cultures while the Top-Down approach can account for situational variations to explain deceptive behavior patterns in order to create an applicable cross-cultural IMT model.

*''Moral judgment''

Research suggests young children's view of how information is perceived as deceptive varies as children grow older.  This variation in moral judgment suggests that moral development is critical in perceptions of right or wrong.  As individuals experience a series of (moral) developmental stages such as avoiding punishment, gaining rewards, identifying individual duty role in society to meet expectations of others (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005), different behavior modeling criteria is established through communication situations that cognitively stimulates and challenges moral judgment. These stages, frequency and types of development models are theorized to be more or less universal across cultures.  However, moral judgment in IMT should be reserved for other communication theory that more distinctly addresses broad, generic cultural criteria patterns and specific requirements of societies to establish what does or does not covertly violate global conversational maxims.
 
*''Consequence resulting from the deceptive message''

IMT supports the idea that deception may or may not be detectable. When participants are asked to rate message features like how much information was false, omitted, equivocal and/or irrelevant, researchers can reasonably measure and describe such multidimensional deceptive messages.  However, the measurability results and conceptual meaning of degrees of deception and its impact is unclear (Levine, Asada &amp; Lindsey 2003).  Information that is manipulated on a continuum from trivial deception to important deception can range from socially acceptable to morally reprehensible.  The more severe lies are rated, the more deceptive the lies than inconsequential ones. Deceiving others about important information is more likely to result in adverse moral judgment and/or moral condemnation.

==Criticism of IMT==

The most significant criticism of information manipulation theory has come in the form of the following two arguments:

* IMT does not correctly interpret the  writings of [[Paul Grice]]'s notion of Conversational Implicature, Conversational Maxims or Cooperation Principle.  This issue was addressed in a critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT provides an explanation for the multiple ways deception can occur. However, it does not predict what conversational maxims a person may violate—only that the violation will occur within the certain realm of possibilities or scenarios provided.  IMT predicts and analyzes the methods of deception a person uses by determining what information is eliminated.
* IMT testing predictions can be made more accurate by use of a different set of information dimensions.  This issue was also addressed in the critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT is a value conscious communication theory.  The researcher must judge and develop criteria for what may be considered deceptiveness.  While violations of the maxim of quality and quantity are more or less objectively derived, violations of relation and manner are largely subjectively assessed. For this reason the researcher must be aware of his/her own bias, value and belief systems and incorporate these predispositions when making these judgments.  Researchers must also construct sound, qualitative/quantitative evaluative criteria to optimize and legitimize the integrity and credibility of their work.

A '''king post''' (or '''king-post''' or '''kingpost''') is a central vertical post used in architectural or bridge designs, working in tension to support a beam below from a truss [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] above (whereas a [[crown post]], though visually similar, supports items above from the beam below).

In aircraft design a strut called a '''king post''' acts in compression, similarly to an architectural crown post.  Usage in mechanical plant and marine engineering differs again, as noted below.

==Architecture==
[[File:king post truss vector.svg|thumb|left|[[timber roof trusses#King post truss|King&amp;nbsp;post&amp;nbsp;truss]]]]
[[File:queen post truss.png|thumb|left|[[timber roof trusses#kqueen post truss|Queen&amp;nbsp;post&amp;nbsp;truss]]]]
A king [[Post (structural)|post]] extends vertically from a [[Beam (structure)|crossbeam]] (the [[tie beam]]) to the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of a triangular [[truss]].{{sfnp|Tredgold|1837|p=94}} The king post, itself in [[Tension (physics)|tension]], connects the apex of the truss with its base, holding up the tie beam (also in tension) at the base of the truss. The post can be replaced with an iron rod called a king rod (or king bolt) and thus a king rod truss.&lt;ref&gt;Siegele, H. H.. ''Roof Framing''. New York: Sterling Pub. Co., 1980. 99. {{ISBN|0806986263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king post truss is also called a "Latin truss".&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hoffsummer, ed. Roof frames from the 11th to the 19th century: typology and development in Northern France and in Belgium : analysis of CRMH documentation. Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2009. Print. {{ISBN|2503529879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional timber framing, a [[crown post]] looks similar to a king post, but it is very different structurally: whereas the king post is in tension, usually supporting the tie beam as a truss, the crown post is supported by the tie beam and is in [[Compression (physical)|compression]]. The crown post rises to a crown plate immediately below and supporting collar beams, it does not rise to the apex like a king post. Historically a crown post was called a king post in England but this usage is obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Richard. Discovering Timber-Framed Buildings. 3rd ed. Princes Risborough: Shire, 1993. pp.79, 85, 87, 95 .&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative truss construction uses two [[queen post]]s (or queen-posts). These vertical posts, positioned along the base of the truss, are supported by the sloping sides of the truss, rather than reaching its apex. A development adds a collar beam above the queen posts, which are then termed queen struts. A section of the tie beam between the queen posts may be removed to create a [[hammerbeam roof]].{{-}}

==King post truss==
[[File:King post truss.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of the parts of a king post truss]]
[[File:King post truss.jpg|thumb|right|A king post truss bridge]]
The king post truss is used for simple roof trusses and short-span bridges. It is the simplest form of truss in that it is constructed of the fewest number of truss members (individual lengths of wood or metal). The truss consists of two diagonal members that meet at the apex of the truss, one horizontal beam that serves to tie the bottom end of the diagonals together, and the king post which connects the apex to the horizontal beam below. For a roof truss, the diagonal members are called [[rafter]]s, and the horizontal member may serve as a ceiling [[joist]]. A bridge would require two king post trusses with the driving surface between them. A roof usually uses many side-by-side trusses depending on the size of the structure.{{sfnp|Wood|1883|p=43}}

[[Pont-y-Cafnau]], the world's first iron railway bridge, is of the king post type.

King posts were used in [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] roof construction in Roman buildings,&lt;ref&gt;Perring, Dominic. The Roman house in Britain. London: Routledge, 2002. 119. {{ISBN|0415221986}} "The king-post roof was possibly a Hellenistic innovation, but is first positively attested by a bronze copy in the second-century AD porch of the Pantheon at Rome."&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[medieval architecture]] in buildings such as [[parish church]]es and [[tithe barn]]s. The oldest surviving roof truss in the world is a king post truss in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Feilden, Bernard M.. Conservation of historic buildings. 3rd ed. Oxford: Architectural Press, 2003. 51. {{ISBN|0750658630}}&lt;/ref&gt; built between 548 and 565.&lt;ref&gt;Din, Mursi Saad El et al.. Sinai: the site &amp; the history : essays. New York: New York University Press, 1998. 80. {{ISBN|0814722032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King posts also appear in [[Gothic Revival architecture]], [[Queen Anne style architecture]] and occasionally in modern construction. King post trusses are also used as a structural element in wood and metal bridges.

A painting by Karl Blechen circa 1833 illustrating construction of the second Devil's Bridge (''Teufelsbrücke'') in the [[Schöllenen Gorge]] shows multiple king posts suspended from the apex of the [[falsework]] upon which the masonry arch has been laid. In this example, beams in compression are supported by each king post several feet below the apex, and the bottom of the king posts can clearly be seen to be unsupported.

==Norman truss==
Architectural historians in the French colonial cities [[St Louis]], [[Missouri]] and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] use the term "Norman roof" to refer to a steeply pitched roof; it is supported by what they call a "Norman truss" which is similar to a king post truss. This is a [[purlin|through-purlin]] truss consisting of a tie beam and paired truss blades, with a central king post to support the roof ridge. The name derives from a belief that this system of construction was introduced to North America by settlers from [[Normandy]] in northern France, but it is really a misnomer as the system was more widely used than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Jay Dearborn |last2=Kariouk (Pecquet du Bellay de Verton) |first2=Nicolas |title=A Creole Lexicon |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EY5E5bp9KGwC&amp;pg |publisher=LSU Press |isbn=0-8071-2764-7 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between a Norman truss and a king post truss is the tie beam in a Norman truss is technically a collar beam (a beam between the rafters above the rafter feet) where the king post truss the rafters land on top of a tie beam.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a king post supports the top cables or "ground wires" supporting the wing. Only on the ground are these wires from the kingpost in tension, while in the air under [[g-force|positive g]] flight they are unloaded.

==Mechanical plant==
The very robust hinge connecting the boom to the chassis in a [[backhoe]], similar in function and appearance to a large automotive [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]], is called a king post.

The '''Lilly Research Centre''' is a medical research centre in [[Surrey]]. It is the European headquarters of [[Eli Lilly and Company]].

==History==
In 1968, when the centre opened, Eli Lilly was spending £20m on research in the UK. The average research cost of a [[New chemical entity|new molecular entity]] is currently over £1bn. In 2003, a £40m investment transformed the site into a Centre of Excellence in Neuroscience Research. 

[[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] visited the site on 11 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 12 June 2003, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directors===
* David Dennen
* John Wold 1983-
* [[Karin Briner]] 2007-10

==Structure==
It is accessed via the [[A30 road|A30]] and B3020, and the [[A322 road|A322]] via junction 3 of the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]]. The site has a 200-seat restaurant. The EMC building opened in 2000. The site is set in woodland.

'''Mikhail P. Kulakov''' (March 29, 1927 in [[St. Petersburg|Leningrad]] – February 10, 2010 in [[Highland]], [[California]], United States) was a Russian [[pastor]], social and religious activist, and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Bible scholar and translator.  He was co-founder of the Russian Branch of the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] [http://irla.org] (1992), founder of the Institute for Bible Translation in Zaoksky (Tula Region, Russia), an honorary board member of the [[Russian Bible Society]]  [http://www.biblia.ru/about/direction/kylakov], and the head of the Church of [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s in the [[Soviet Union]] (1990—1992). Kulakov's work on translating the Bible into modern Russian language has been lauded by biblical scholars, philologists, theologians and various representatives of [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://predanie.ru/lib/book/67500|title=Новый Завет (перевод под ред. Кулакова М. П.)|work=Предание.Ру - православный mp3 архив - скачать}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Mikhail Petrovich Kulakov was born on March 29, 1927 in [[Leningrad]] ([[St. Petersburg]])  to the family of a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] pastor. In 1928, his family moved to the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] (in Central Russia) when his father, Peter Stepanovich Kulakov, was sent there for pastoral ministry.  During the [[Atheism|atheist]] and authoritarian rule of the Soviet government, the Kulakov family was under the scrutiny of state security bodies. In 1935, his father was arrested for religious activity and the court sentenced him to imprisonment in the camps of Vorkuta, followed by an exile in [[Siberia]].  Following the exile, the Kulakov family moved to the village Krasnyi Klyuch in the [[Krasnoyarsk]] Region, where they lived until 1939. After the end of the exile the family moved to Samara and then to Maykop (Adygea, Russia) where they lived until the eve of the [[World War II|Second World War]] when they relocated to Ivanovo. Here Mikhail Kulakov enrolled in the Ivanovo Art School, from which he graduated in 1947.

In August 1945, Kulakov became a baptized member of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. (As he recalled in his book,&lt;ref&gt;Though the Heavens Fall, R &amp; H, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-8280-2366-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; “...late at night, far away from the city lights, my father secretly baptised eight people, including me. I was 18 years old...”). Following his baptism, he began to actively assist his father in conducting clandestine worship services and the missionary work. In 1947, his father was arrested again and was given a ten-year sentence. It was then that Kulakov's mother moved him and his siblings to Daugavpils, [[Latvia]]. Here, Kulakov continued to work in the church and also taught drawing and painting in the city schools. The peaceful existence was short-lived, and nine months later in March 1948, he was arrested by the [[KGB]] along with his elder brother Stephen. After serving six months in prison in [[Ivanovo]], Kulakov was sentenced to five years in the corrective hard [[Gulag|labor camps of the U.S.S.R.]] The first 18 months of his five-year term (1948–1953) he was held in the corrective labor camp in Mordovia (about 400 miles east of [[Moscow]]).
Kulakov's brother Stephen was one of the thousands who died in the labor camps near the Far North city of [[Vorkuta]]. Despite the many hardships he faced, Kulakov remembered his experiences in the camps as a “life university” and he was grateful that he survived. He also recalled that these years were brightened for him because he had the opportunity to share his faith with the other captives in the camps.

In 1953, his sentence expired and Kulakov was sent into permanent exile in the Kazakh village Myrzykul (Kustanai region). After marrying his wife Anna (née Velgosha) in 1954, he was released from exile under amnesty. In 1955, he and his young family moved to [[Alma-Ata]] the former capital of [[Kazakhstan]]. It was here that the Kulakov family became actively involved in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] ministry despite severe persecution.

== Role in the unification and development of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the Soviet Union ==

In 1958, Kulakov was ordained as a minister and was elected head of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]] organization that at the time existed unofficially in the republics of Central Asia, [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Caucasus]].
In the 1960s, the Soviet government continued its persecution of religious organizations despite the external liberalization of some aspects of religious life in the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]]. Because of this, Kulakov and his family were forced to repeatedly change their place of residence to avoid arrests. In 1960, he moved his family from [[Almaty]] to the village of Akkul’ ([[Dzhambul]] region), then in 1962 to [[Kokand]] and in 1966 to [[Chimkent]] (in southern [[Kazakhstan]]).

In the late 1960s the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]] [http://www.adventist.org] (the supreme governing body of Adventists, located in the U.S.) tried unsuccessfully to establish contacts with the Adventists in the Soviet Union – the activity of the church was then strictly controlled by state authorities. For many decades Seventh-day Adventist living in the Soviet Union could not attend the international meetings of the world church. In 1970 yet another attempt was made to invite a delegation from the Soviet Union to the Adventist World Congress in Detroit but neither Kulakov nor other pastors who had received an invitation were allowed release from the country.

In the fall of 1970, Kulakov was able to visit the U.S. on a private invitation of his aunt, Valentina Popova, then living in [[California]]. His trip to the U.S. coincided with the annual meeting of the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]], to which, Kulakov was invited. This conference was a notable event, because since 1909, none of the Russian Adventist leaders had ever been to the headquarters of the General Conference. The president of the General Conference at the time, Robert Pearson, and other church leaders expressed great interest in the happenings of the Adventists in the Soviet Union. Aware of internal discord and organizational difficulties that prevailed in the church in the area, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] leaders requested and authorized Kulakov to take responsibility for the reconciliation and unification of disparate groups of Seventh-day Adventist communities in the Soviet Union.

In the years following the visit to the General Conference World Headquarters, Kulakov, driven by his passionate desire to see his beloved church united and vibrant, together with his colleagues in the Central Asian republics and in the Baltic republics, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, worked tirelessly to bring about the consolidation of the Seventh-day Adventist communities into one united family. Kulakov devoted over twenty years of his life to the cause of reconciliation and re-unification of the isolated groups of Adventists in the U.S.S.R.

In 1975, along with six other leaders of the church, Kulakov was able to attend the next congress of the General Conference in Vienna, Austria. For the first time, after six decades of isolation and repression, the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the Soviet Union was represented at the World Congress . Kulakov was elected as the member of the Executive Committee of the General Conference  and became a member of the Academy of Adventist Ministers.

Also in 1975, the Seventh-day Adventist Church leaders in [[Moscow]], [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Leningrad]] and other Russian cities asked Mikhail P. Kulakov to move from [[Kazakhstan]] to the Russian Federation in order to create a single church organization on the territory of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]].  In response to this request and on the recommendation of the President of the General Conference, Kulakov moved to Russia at the end of 1975 and settled in Tula.

In March 1977, after a 50-year interval, the first official Congress of the Adventists took place in Russia. The aim was to unite disparate groups into one Adventist church organization. At this time M.P. Kulakov was elected as head of the association of Adventist Churches in the Russian Federation. However, the government authorities were slow to permit the establishment of the church organization which would be in full accord with the denominational Working Policy.

The complete re-unification of the splintered groups of Adventists in the Soviet Union was only achieved by the end of 1980, when Kulakov was able to negotiate permission for the official visit to the [[U.S.S.R.]] of the General Conference president [[Neal C. Wilson]].&lt;ref name=" GCC1981-10"&gt;[http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/GCC/GCC1981-10/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=15&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the Adventist World Church, Wilson communicated to the Adventists in the U.S.S.R. that the General Conference recognized the official leadership of the church in the U.S.S.R. and appealed to the leaders of all factions to join the officially recognized group of Adventists in the U.S.S.R., forming one organization with them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/GCC/GCC1981-10/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, an advisory board was formed at the semi-official meeting of church leaders from all republics of the former Soviet Union. It was a step to unite scattered groups of Adventist believers of the Soviet Union into one organization. Mikhail P. Kulakov (from the Russian Federation) and Nikolai A. Zhukalyuk (from the [[Ukraine]]) were elected as the coordinators of this advisory board.  Working closely with the leaders of the church in the various other republics of the U.S.S.R., they worked to re-unite and organize national and local associations of Adventists throughout the Soviet Union as close to the Working Policy of the world church organization as the circumstances at the time would allow.

To recognize Kulakov's role in the unification and organization of the Adventist Church, the [[Southwestern Adventist University|Southwestern Adventist College]] in [[Texas]], USA awarded M.P. Kulakov an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctoral Degree]] in Theology in 1987.

== Founding of an educational institution and publishing house ==

Mikhail Kulakov, along with his son Mikhail Mikhailovich Kulakov, led in the establishment and development of a theological seminary for the training of pastors in the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the [[U.S.S.R.]]  After much effort and intense dialogue with the authorities and government officials, they were able to receive the necessary authorizations. The Kulakov family moved to the village of Zaoksky in 1988, where the first Protestant theological seminary in the country was thus established (currently Zaoksky Theological Seminary) [http://www.zau.ru]. A few years later under Kulakov leadership, "Source of Life", the first Seventh-day Adventist publishing house in the [[U.S.S.R.]], was opened as well [http://www.lifesource.ru].

It was not until 1990   that the Adventists were able to receive the permission of the Soviet government to form the Euro-Asia Division of the world Adventist Church at the 1990  World Congress in [[Indianapolis]], IN and Kulakov was elected as its president.&lt;ref name=" GCC1990-07"&gt;[http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/GCC/GCC1990-07/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=3&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public activities ==

In the 1970s and 1980s Kulakov, as one of the influential religious leaders in the [[U.S.S.R.]], represented the Seventh-day Adventist Church at various public events in the [[U.S.S.R.]] and abroad at international conferences in defense of peace. In June 1977, he participated in the World Conference "Religious Leaders for Lasting Peace, Disarmament and Just Relations Among Nations" and in 1982 he was invited to take part in the World Conference "Religious Workers for Saving the Sacred Gift of Life from Nuclear Catastrophe" in [[Moscow]]. Kulakov also took part in numerous other Christian Peace conferences, which took place abroad. In 1978 (June 22–27) he traveled to [[Prague]] with a delegation of ministers from various religious bodies in the Soviet Union to attend the conference of the Christian Peace Movement ({{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/17-1-95.shtml |title=Christian Peace Movement |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67vUoatBc?url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/17-1-95.shtml |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}). A few years later in 1983 (20–24 April), Kulakov took an active part in the same conference in Sweden in [[Uppsala]] (For Life and Peace) ({{cite web |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=2202148&amp;fileOId=2214687 |title=For Life and Peace |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67vUp9JAW?url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=2202148&amp;fileOId=2214687 |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}). In the mid-1980s he twice traveled to Japan to participate in the peace conferences organized by the religious organizations of Japan.

In the late 1980s, with the improving relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States, the idea of "[[public diplomacy]]" gained popularity as an effective means of removing tension in the world. As a result, possibilities emerged for meetings with the public figures from the Soviet Union. Kulakov, as one of the religious leaders, was invited to attend the International Chautauqua Conference on US-Soviet Relations, held in [[Chautauqua]], NY., August 24–28, 1987{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/rus/text_files/EastUropeProblems/1987-19-20/1987-19-20%20%28220-226%29.pdf |title=Chautauqua |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67vUpjznm?url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/rus/text_files/EastUropeProblems/1987-19-20/1987-19-20%20%28220-226%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.

In October 1987, Kulakov was invited to join the Governing Board of the Soviet Children's Fund, where he had the opportunity to collaborate with the Russian writer and chairman of the Fund, Albert Likhanov, in achieving the goals of the foundation.

On September 26, 1990, Kulakov, along with the head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]], was invited to the session of the Supreme Soviet of the [[U.S.S.R.]] (highest legislative body). It was there that he was able to outline his views on the new draft of the law for freedom of religion. At the end of 1990, Kulakov had a third meeting with the President of the Soviet Union [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] regarding the religious freedom in the [[U.S.S.R.]]  Gorbachev at the time was seeking the support of religious leaders of the country.

Having personally lived through persecution for his religious beliefs, Kulakov was a constant voice in defense of religious freedom and actively participated in the international conferences on the protection of religious freedom. In 1990, he initiated the establishment of the Russian branch of the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] [http://irla.org International Religious Liberty Association]. He was then elected Secretary General of the Russian branch of the association and acted as its representative to the Public Chamber of the Russian President from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiouslibertydinner.com/awardees/mikhail_kulakov.php|title=Religious Liberty Dinner|work=religiouslibertydinner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the priest Alexander Borisov, Kulakov also took part in the establishment of the [[Russian Bible Society]] [http://www.biblia.ru/about/direction/kylakov].

One of Kulakov's favorite biblical passages was: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (II Epistle to Corinthians 3:17). Throughout his lifetime, he worked to create a dialogue between all groups of people and create an atmosphere of spiritual and intellectual freedom toward a common good. In a recent interview, Kulakov stated:

"Today I am greatly concerned about the underestimation of the importance of freedom of the individual. We have come through a very dark time when as if with the asphalt roller they tried to crush all individuality and to stifle the freedom of expression. It is impossible to forget that, and we should never forget it! These lessons should be remembered by those who care about the welfare of their native country, about their own children and the future generations. Each of us should think about the kind of foundations that we are laying today. So that the people of Russia could live a full life, filled with joy, with a sense of peace, and free from the fear that you will be silenced, oppressed and exterminated just because you desired to speak freely. This is crucial. This is what can save us as a nation and as a country from the horrors that we experienced in the twentieth century.

== Establishment of the Institute for Bible Translation ==

In 1992, Kulakov submitted his resignation as head of the Church in order to devote himself to translating the Bible into the modern Russian language.  Kulakov established the [http://bible.zau.ru Institute for Bible Translation] with the goal of completing a translation of the Russian Bible that is free from denominational bias. To achieve this goal, he invited a wide range of specialists from different denominations to work with him on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russianbible.ru/staff/]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, Kulakov combined this activity with his responsibility as the Secretary General of the Russian Branch of the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] as well as teaching courses in homiletics at Zaoksky Theological Seminary. However, he had to give up other activities to complete the translation of the [[New Testament]]. In April 2000, the Institute completed work on the New Testament and published the first edition of the New Testament in Modern Russian Translation. All 12,500 copies in circulation sold out that year and by popular demand it has been republished.

That same year, at the [[General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]] Session in [[Toronto]], Mikhail P. Kulakov presented the New Testament to the delegates at the World Seventh-day Adventist Congress, and it was decided that he should continue working on the translation of the remainder of the [[Bible]].  Kulakov moved to the United States with his wife in December 2000. Several years later a second edition of the New Testament and Psalms in the modern Russian translation, as well as the Five Books of Moses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://predanie.ru/lib/book/67502/ Five Books of Moses] {{ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the books of Daniel and the Minor Prophets &lt;ref&gt;[http://predanie.ru/lib/aut/67507/— fb2, mobi, epub] {{ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published. In August 2001,  [http://www.andrews.edu Andrews University] awarded Mikhail P. Kulakov a second honorary doctorate in theology for his contribution to the translation of the Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zau.ru/about/?ipb=a_hist Index of /about&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826215136/http://www.zau.ru/about/?ipb=a_hist |date=2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years and death ==

Though Kulakov lived the remainder of his life in [[California]], he continued to visit Russia to conduct conferences and business meetings with the staff of his [http://bible.zau.ru Bible Translation Institute] at Zaoksky Theological Seminary. In autumn of 2009, Kulakov was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent treatment at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center|Loma Linda University Hospital]].

He died on February 10, 2010 at his home in [[Highland]], California. On the day of his death, the new Russian translation of the [[Pentateuch]] to which he devoted the last five years of his life was printed at Zaoksky. In May 2010, at its annual session, the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Bible Translation at Zaoksky agreed to name the Institute after Kulakov.

Mikhail P. Kulakov was buried at  [http://www.glenwoodcemetery.net The Glenwood Cemetery] in Washington, DC.

'''Narratology''' is the study of [[narrative]] and [[narrative structure]] and the ways that these affect our perception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Narratology], College of Liberal Arts, [[Purdue University]]&lt;/ref&gt; While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is an anglicisation of French ''narratologie'', coined by [[Tzvetan Todorov]] (''Grammaire du Décaméron'', 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Prince]], "Narratology," ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the [[Russian Formalists]], particularly [[Vladimir Propp]] (''Morphology of the Folktale'', 1928), and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theories of [[heteroglossia]], [[dialogism]], and the [[chronotope]] first presented in ''The Dialogic Imagination'' (1975).

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the [[Structuralism | structuralist]] quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the [[Formal grammar|grammars]] used as a basis for [[parsing]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in some forms of [[linguistics]]. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; [[Percy Lubbock]]'s work in [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] (''The Craft of Fiction'', 1921) offers a case in point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1966 a special issue of the journal ''Communications'' proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"/&gt; It included articles by [[Barthes]], Claude Brémond, [[Genette]], [[Greimas]], [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov]] and others, which in turn often referred to the works of [[Vladimir Propp]]&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"&gt;Herman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], pp.574–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"&gt;Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HozLdEhiN-8C&amp;pg=PA40 ''Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History''], p.40{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1895–1970).

[[Jonathan Culler]] (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story," a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and "discourse," the discursive presentation or narration of events.'&lt;ref&gt;
Jonathan Culler, ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'', Routledge Classics ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Russian Formalists]] first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet [[fabula and sujet]]. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. ''histoire''/''discours'', ''histoire''/''récit'', ''story''/''plot''. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ronen, "Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology", ''Poetics Today'', 11(4):817–842 (Winter 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg]], ''Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction'', (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], 1984, and [[Raphaël Baroni|Baroni]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphaël Baroni]], ''La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosité et surprise'', (Paris: Seuil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

[[James Phelan (literary scholar) | James Phelan]], editor of ''Narrative'' (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list).

Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[film theory]] and (to a lesser extent) [[film criticism]]. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] studies of oral storytelling ([[William Labov]]) and in [[conversation analysis]] or [[discourse analysis]] that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, [[graphic novels]], the [[infinite canvas]], and narrative sculptures linked to [[topology]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt; Félix Lambert, 2015, "[https://www.academia.edu/11744670/Narrative_sculptures_graph_theory_topology_and_new_perspectives_in_narratology Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology]." &lt;/ref&gt;
However, constituent analysis of a type where [[narreme]]s are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], or [[literary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975a-theonarreme.pdf Théorie des narrèmes et algorithmes narratifs]," ''Poetics'' 4.1 (1975): 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project''' ('''POST''') is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that researches the behavior of marine animals through the use of ocean [[telemetry]] and data management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coml.org/projects/pacific-ocean-shelf-tracking-project-post|title=Program Description on CoML Website|website=Coml.org|accessdate=11 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328132509/http://www.coml.org/projects/pacific-ocean-shelf-tracking-project-post|archive-date=2009-03-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of telemetry consists of highly efficient lines of acoustic receivers that create sections of the continental shelf along the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]].  The acoustic receivers pick up signals from the tagged animals as they pass along the lines, allowing for the documentation of movement patterns.  The receivers also allow for the estimation of parameters such as swimming speed and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info:doi/10.1371/issue.pcol.v01.i05|title=PLOS Collections: Article collections published by the Public Library of Science|website=Ploscollections.org|accessdate=11 July 2018|doi=10.1371/issue.pcol.v01.i05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trackers sit on the [[seabed]] of the continental shelf and in the major rivers of the world.

[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory postulated that every part of the body emits tiny particles called gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and are transferred to offspring. Gemmules were thought to develop into their associated body parts as offspring matures. The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]].]]

'''Pangenesis''' was [[Charles Darwin]]'s hypothetical mechanism for [[heredity]], in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called '''gemmules''' that aggregated in the [[gonad]]s, contributing heritable information to the [[gamete]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pan'' (a prefix meaning "whole", "encompassing") and ''genesis'' ("birth") or ''genos'' ("origin"). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by [[Hippocrates]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but built off of new concepts such as [[cell theory]], explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also accounted for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among [[biologist]]s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of the [[Mendelian inheritance|particulate nature of inheritance]].

==Early history==

Pangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix ''pan'').&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zirkle | first1 = Conway | authorlink = Conway Zirkle | year = 1935 | title = The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis | url = | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin wrote that Hippocrates' pangenesis was "almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher."&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote that:

{{quote|The hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]], [[Galen]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]], [[St. Isidore of Seville]], [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], [[St. Albert the Great]], [[St. Thomas of Aquinas]], [[Pietro de' Crescenzi|Peter of Crescentius]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[Nicolas Venette|Venette]], [[John Ray]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Charles Bonnet|Bonnet]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertius]], [[Albrecht von Haller|von Haller]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Zirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck's work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates' belief that "the semen was derived from the whole body."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=1981 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674364462 |pages=328, 646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin's pangenesis, wherein 'organic molecules' were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. (1988). ''Science as a Process: An Evolutionary Account of the Social and Conceptual Development of Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-36051-2}} "As Darwin was to discover many years later, Buffon had devised a system of heredity not all that different from his own theory of pangenesis."&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, "If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;

In 1801, [[Erasmus Darwin]] advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book ''[[Zoonomia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}} "Among the other authors were Buffon, who proposes "organic molecules" with affinities to various organs, and, in particular, Erasmus Darwin, who in 1801 anticipated his grandson's concept of pangenesis, suggesting that small particles were given off by parts of the bodies of both parents; and that they are circulated in the blood, ending in the sexual organs from where they could be combined during reproduction in order to form the nucleus of an offspring."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, either from effects of the environment or  may be passed on to the offspring.  Charles Darwin first had significant contact with [[Lamarckism]] during his time at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in the late 1820s, both through [[Robert Edmond Grant]], whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus's journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=E. Janet|title=Charles Darwin: Vol. 1, Voyaging|date=1995|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=1-84413-314-1|pages=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's first known writings on the topic of Lamarckian ideas as they related to inheritance are found in a notebook he opened in 1837, also entitled ''Zoonomia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57383252|title=The Cambridge companion to Darwin|last=|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Hodge, M.

In 1861, Irish physician [[Henry Freke]] developed a variant of pangenesis in his book ''Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macalister|Macalister, Alexander]]. (1870). ''Reviews and Bibliographical Notices''. In ''[[Irish Journal of Medical Science|Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science]], Volume 50''. Fannin and Company. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named ''granules'', which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=On the origin of species by means of organic affinity|last=Freke|first=Henry|date=1861|publisher=Longman and Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, four years before the publication of ''Variation'', [[Herbert Spencer]] in his book ''Principles of Biology'' proposed a theory of "physiological units" similar to Darwin's gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring.&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"/&gt; He also supported the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.

Darwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in ''Variation'' after sending a 30 page manuscript to his close friend and supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt; However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: "Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis &amp; say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4875.html | title = Letter 4875 – Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C. R., 16 July (1865) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of ''Variation'' in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.

[[File:Gemmule cell proliferation (pangenesis).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Darwin's description of cell proliferation using pangenesis theory in ''The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication'']]

Some gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents' gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds "most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=276}} He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to [[Fleming Jenkin]]'s review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn't die out through blending.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=283}}

Darwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organisms life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the 'monstrosities' Darwin cited in ''Variation''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== De Vries ===
[[Hugo de Vries]] characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:

:I. In the cells there are numberless particles which differ from each other, and represent the individual cells, organs, functions and qualities of the whole individual. These particles are much larger than the chemical molecules and smaller than the smallest known organisms; yet they are for the most part comparable to the latter, because, like them, they can divide and multiply through nutrition and growth. They are transmitted, during cell-division, to the daughter-cells: this is the ordinary process of heredity.
:II. In addition to this, the cells of the organism, at every stage of development, throw off such particles, which are conducted to the germ-cells and transmit to them those characters which the respective cells may have acquired during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries|first=Hugo|title=Intracellular Pangenesis|url=http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=1910|origyear=1889|page=63|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries also coined the term 'pangene' which 20 years later was shortened by [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] to [[gene]].

=== Other variants ===
Science historian [[E. Janet Browne|Janet Browne]] points out that while [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Carl von Nägeli]] also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed in that it contained "a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}} Spencer published his theory of "physiological units" three years prior to Darwin's publication of ''Variation''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

She goes on to say that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules for each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}}

Interpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until [[August Weismann|Weismann's]] experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin's pangenesis to the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Graft Theory of Disease: Being an Application of Mr. Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis to the Explanation of the Phenomena of the Zymotic Diseases|last=Ross|first=James|publisher=Lindsay and Blakiston|year=1872|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Collapse ==

=== Galton's experiments on rabbits ===
Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]] conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood.  In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Galton|Galton]] was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin’s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin's gemmules, which he called "pangenes," might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=291–292}}

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''Nature'' where he wrote:&lt;ref name=Darwin1871&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darwin, Charles R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=27 April 1871 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Pangenesis |journal=Nature. A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science |volume=3 |pages=502–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood." He goes on to admit: "Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.&lt;ref name=Darwin1871/&gt;}}

After the circulation of Galton's results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Weismann ===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the gonads. Somatic cells (of the body) develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. The implied [[Weismann barrier]] between the germ line and the soma prevents Lamarckian inheritance.|270x270px]]

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892|title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung|author=Weismann, August|date=1892|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the [[Weismann barrier|Weismann Barrier]]. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Peter|date=March–May 1990|title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis?|journal=BIOS|volume=61|pages=6–8|jstor=4608123|number=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193707|title=Neo-Lamarckism and the evolution controversy in France, 1870-1920|last=1940-|first=Persell, Stuart Michael,|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=077348275X|location=Lewiston, NY|oclc=40193707}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to [[Eclipse of Darwinism|its eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23693-6|edition=3rd completely rev. and expanded|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=253–256|authorlink=Peter J.

=== After pangenesis ===

Darwin's pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] premise that parents could [[inheritance of acquired characters|pass on traits acquired]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|last2=Li|first2=Xiuju|date=2014-09-23|title=Has Darwin's Pangenesis Been Rediscovered?|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/11/1037/2754242|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=11|pages=1037–1041|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu151|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Italian Botanist Federico Delpino's objection that gemmules' ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of small pox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lamarckism fell from favour after [[August Weismann]]'s research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable.&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/ |title=The Textbook Letter |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |publisher=The Textbook League |publication-date=September–October 1994 |contribution=Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |accessdate=2008-01-23 |contribution-url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q |title=A History of the Life Sciences |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scientists continued to voice their support  in spite of Galton's and Weismann's results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis "is no more disproved by the statement that ‘gemmules have not been found in the blood,’ than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PSwRAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=The+Grammar+of+Science&amp;ots=T5EHpFM1SO&amp;sig=1AasXoTNJ_snuqbDZwDknU7ilks#v=snippet&amp;q=atomic%20theory&amp;f=false|title=The Grammar of Science|last=Pearson|first=Karl|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1900|isbn=9785877362529|location=London|pages=335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel's Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Beer|first1=Gavin|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|date=1965|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|location=Garden City, NY|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of [[chromosome]]s and the research of [[T.

Some of Darwin's pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of [[phenotypic plasticity]], although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton's experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940's in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosin, I.

Darwin himself had noted that "the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption"; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West=Eberhard08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West-Eberhard |first1=M.

'''Peace Mala''' ('''The Peace Mala Project for World Peace'''), is an organisation based in [[Morriston]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] dedicated to fostering inter-cultural and inter-faith tolerance through the manufacture, distribution and wearing of a symbolic [[Japa mala|mala]] (bracelet) whose beads represent various faiths.

The organisation's stated aims are "promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/ From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mala bracelet==
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion]]s, [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]]. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one  symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of [[causality]] and the path of peace and friendship to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html Official description of the symbology and representations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831214813/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in [[Llanelli]], Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]]" attacks in New York to [[Islamophobia]], racism, religious intolerance and [[fundamentalism]] worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: "''I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3162388.stm Word spreads of 'peace mala'], BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala.  On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), Evans was awarded the ''Noble Soul'' Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools.  The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the ''International Day of Peace.''

===Launch===
Peace Mala was officially launched in the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|UNA Temple of Peace]] in [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Rowan Williams]] (later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School.

Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably [[The Prince's Trust]] Millennium Award in 2003, the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] Community Dividend Award in 2003, the [[ChildLine]] Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004.  In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the [[CEWC-Cymru]] "Right-On" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth.

==Charitable status==
On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a [[company limited by guarantee]] and not having a share capital, was entered in the [[Central Register of Charities]] as Registered Charity No. 1118053.

==Patrons==
[[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the ''Yundrung Bön Study Centre''.

===Rowan Williams===
Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by [[Barry Morgan]].  Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002.

In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams  Archbishop Of Canterbury|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815001700/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|archivedate=15 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lama Khemsar Rinpoche===
Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala.  Rinpoche left [[Tibet]] in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung Bön tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US.

Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director  Of The Tibetan Yungdrung Bon Study Centre|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195024/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly Bön [[Ngöndro|Zogchen Ngöndro]] prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales.

==Website==
The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% [[solar power]] by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama|the 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Jillian Evans]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], Sir [[Mark Tully]] [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and Barbara Dickson.

==Registered office==
On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Of The Registered Office For Peace Mala|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung Bön practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly ''Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro'' prayers and meditations. Yungdrung Bön (meaning ''Eternal Light'' or ''Enlightened Teaching'') is the pre-Buddhist [[Bön]] faith of [[Tibet]].

===Peace Garden===
Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Buddharupa|Buddhist statues]] and [[prayer flags]], a miniature [[Zen]]-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by [[Neopaganism|Witches]], and [[Druid]]s.  There is also a tranquil area facing [[Mecca]], which is dedicated to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]].

==Aims==
Peace Mala outlined its "Main Aims" as:
*Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths.
*Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice.
*Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally.

==Educational work==
Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming "''global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths''".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alex, "Youngsters honoured for promoting peace", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Awards for Youth===
In 2006 Peace Mala launched the ''Peace Mala Awards for Youth''.  The awards and competition encourage young people "''...  to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH  Award Winners 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011636/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html |date=20 April 2012 }}. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positivenews.org.uk/2007/archive/1144/peace-mala-international-youth-awards/ "Peace Mala International Youth Awards"], ''Positive News'', 17 October 2007. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5–11) and the other for seniors (12–18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop.

In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kay, "Peace hopes win top prize", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 27 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation.

===Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups===
In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups.  As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive.  Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala.

Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria:

# Community cohesion and global citizenship
# Needs and human rights
# Interdependence
# Active compassion
# Celebrating diversity
# Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change
# Conflict resolution and peace education

==Interfaith engagement==
Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity.

====Santiago de Compostela====

====Gower====
In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the [[Gower Peninsula]], as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and [[Dolmen|cromlech]] stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in [[Llanrhidian]]. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the [[Brigidine Sisters]] of the Solas Bhríde hermitage; she then received the [[World Peace Flame]] at the [[Dru yoga|Dru International]] Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in [[Snowdonia National Park]]; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at [[St David's Cathedral]] by The Very Revd [[Jonathan Lean]]. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]]; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as [[ISKCON]] sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan.

At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilgrims step out on peace walk", ''[[South Wales Evening Post]]'', 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Llangyfelach "Forgotten" Monastery====
On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in [[Llangyfelach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul, "Old tradition revived by pilgrimage", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]], as well as representatives from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University]], the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhism among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Pam, "Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery", ''Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea &amp; Brecon '', Issue № 18, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travelling Doves of Peace====
Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30th April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance.

The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online.

[[File:Dove 13 in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Dove 13 in Jerusalem]]

Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website.

===Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education===
The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010.  The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK.  Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008.

The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity.  Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.  Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester.

Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE.

===Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales===
On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales.  This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance.

'''Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK'''

On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus.  This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience.
The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011.

===International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017===
In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted.

===Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017===
On September 21st 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day.

Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‘One Light’ in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children’s singing on St Joseph’s Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he susprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis,

''"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers."''

This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea.

===Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018===
On September 21st 2018 Peace Mala will be working with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace. Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation will be joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7107">'''Protein–lipid interaction''' is the influence of [[membrane protein]]s on the [[lipid]] [[physical state]] or vice versa.

The questions which are relevant to understanding of the [[structure]] and [[Function (biology)|function]] of the membrane are: 1) Do intrinsic membrane proteins bind tightly to lipids (see [[annular lipid shell]]), and what is the nature of the layer of lipids adjacent to the protein? 2) Do membrane proteins have long-range effects on the order or dynamics of membrane lipids? 3) How do the lipids influence  the structure and/or function of membrane proteins? 4) How do [[peripheral membrane protein]]s which bind to the layer surface interact with lipids and influence their behavior?

== Binding of lipids to intrinsic membrane proteins in the bilayer ==

A large research effort involves approaches to know whether proteins have binding sites which are specific for particular lipids and whether the protein–lipid complexes can be considered to be long-lived, on the order of the time required for the turnover a typical [[enzyme]], that is 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; sec. This is now known through the use of [[Deuterium NMR|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR]], [[Electron spin resonance|ESR]], and [[fluorescent]] methods.

There are two approaches used to measure the relative affinity of lipids binding to specific membrane proteins. These involve the use of lipid analogues in reconstituted [[phospholipid]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing the protein of interest:
1) [[Spin label|Spin-labeled]] phospholipids are motionally restricted when they are adjacent to membrane proteins. The result is a component in the [[ESR spectrum]] which is broadened. The experimental spectrum can be analyzed as the sum of the two components, a rapidly tumbling species in the "bulk" lipid phase with a sharp spectrum, and a [[Motion (physics)|motionally]] restricted component adjacent to the protein. Membrane protein denaturation causes further broadening of ESR spin label spectrum and throws more light on membrane lipid-proteins interactions &lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1991) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21306553_Protein_heat_denaturation_and_study_of_membrane_lipid-protein_interactions_by_spin_label_ESR?ev=prf_pub "Protein heat denaturation and study of membrane lipid-protein interactions by spin label ESR"]. ''Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods'', vol. 22(1), pp. 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Spin-labeled and [[bromination|brominated]] lipid derivatives are able to quench the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from membrane proteins. The efficiency of quenching depends on the distance between the lipid derivative and the fluorescent tryptophans.

== Perturbations of the lipid bilayer due to the presence of lateral membrane proteins ==

Most &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR experiments with deuterated phospholipids demonstrate that the presence of proteins has little effect on either the order [[parameter]] of the lipids in the bilayer or the lipid [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], as measured by relaxation times. The overall view resulting from NMR experiments is 1) that the exchange rate between boundary and free lipids is rapid, (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 2) that the order parameters of the bound lipid are barely affected by being adjacent to proteins, 3) that the dynamics of the [[acyl chain]] reorientations are slowed only slightly in the [[frequency]] range of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 4) that the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] and the dynamics of the polar headgroups are similarly unaffected in any substantial manner by being adjacent to [[transmembrane protein]]s. 13C-NMR spectrum also gives information on specific lipid-protein interactions of biomembranes &lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1991) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21376891_13C-NMR_studies_of_membrane_lipid-protein_interactions_upon_protein_heat_denaturation?ev=prf_pub "13C-NMR studies of membrane lipid-protein interactions upon protein heat denaturation"]. ''Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical methods'', vol. 23, pp. 259-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent results using non labeled optical methods such as [[Dual Polarisation Interferometry]] which measure the birefringence&lt;ref&gt;Alireza Mashaghi et al. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac800027s "Optical anisotropy of supported lipid structures probed by waveguide spectroscopy and its application to study of supported lipid bilayer formation kinetics"] ''Anal. Chem.'', 80 (10), 3666–3676 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;(or order) within lipid bilayers have been used to show how peptide and protein interactions can influence bilayer order, specifically demonstrating the real time association to bilayer and critical peptide concentration after which the peptides penetrate and disrupt the bilayer order.&lt;ref&gt;Tzong-Hsien Lee, Christine Heng, Marcus J. Swann, John D. Gehman, Frances Separovic, Marie-Isabel Aguilar, "Real time quantitative analysis of lipid disordering by aurein 1.2 during membrane adsorption, destabilisation and lysis", ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta'' (BBA) - ''Biomembranes'' Volume 1798, Issue 10, October 2010, Pages 1977–1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backbone and solid chain dynamics of membrane proteins ==

[[Solid-state NMR]] techniques have the potential to yield detailed information about the dynamics of individual amino acid residues within a membrane protein. However, the techniques can require large amounts (100–200&amp;nbsp;mg) of isotopically labeled proteins and are most informative when applied to small proteins where spectroscopic assignments are possible.

== Binding of peripheral membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer ==

Many [[peripheral membrane protein]]s bind to the membrane primarily through interactions with [[integral membrane protein]]s.  But there is a diverse group of proteins which interact directly with the surface of the [[lipid bilayer]]. Some, such as [[myelin basic protein]], and [[spectrin]] have mainly structural roles.  A number of [[water-soluble]] proteins can bind to the bilayer surface transiently or under specific conditions.

[[Protein misfolding|Misfolding processes]], typically exposing hydrophobic regions of proteins, often are associated with binding to lipid membranes and subsequent aggregation, for example, during [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s, [[Stress (biology)|neuronal stress]] and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Narinder Sanghera, Marcus J. Swann, Gerry Ronan, Teresa J.T. Pinheiro, "Insight into early events in the aggregation of the prion protein on lipid membranes", ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes'', Volume 1788, Issue 10, October 2009, Pages 2245–2251.&lt;/ref&gt;

At puberty, many girls find the sudden sprouting of pubic hair disturbing, and sometimes as unclean, because in many cases young girls have been screened by their family and by society from the sight of pubic hair.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Naked Woman]]|last=Morris|first=Desmond|authorlink=Desmond Morris|chapter=The Pubic Hair|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wa9zntiEKeAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=pubic+hair|pages=192–202|year=2007|isbn=0-09-945358-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young boys, on the other hand, tend not to be similarly disturbed by the development of their pubic hair, usually having seen body hair on their fathers.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; However, to a young boy, the sight of the female pubic region is usually a mystery, and young girls are taught to "guard" their "private area" from inquisitive young eyes and hands. Young girls{{where?|date=June 2013}} are also taught that the sight of a boy's pubic area is rude, immoral and even repulsive.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Development in Childhood|author=John Bancroft|pages=146–147|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34243-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1080/00224499509551774 | last1 = Okami | first1 = P. | year = 1995 | title = Childhood exposure to parental nudity‚ parent-child co-sleeping‚ and 'primal scenes': A review of clinical opinion and empirical evidence | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 51–64 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1023/A:1018736109563 | last1 = Okami | first1 = P. | last2 = Olmstead | first2 = R. | last3 = Abramson | first3 = P. | last4 = Pendleton | first4 = L. | year = 1998 | title = Early childhood exposure to parental nudity and scenes of parental sexuality ('primal scenes'): An 18-year longitudinal study of outcome | url = http://www.taasa.org/library/pdfs/TAASALibrary52.pdf | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 361–384 | pmid = 9681119 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
In ancient Egyptian art, female pubic hair is indicated in the form of painted triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stuckey | first1 = Johanna | year = 2007 | title = The "Holy One | url = http://www.matrifocus.com/LAM07/spotlight.htm | journal = Cross Quarterly for the Goddess Woman | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval and classical European art, it was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Barcan, Ruth (2004). ''Nudity: a cultural anatomy.'' Berg. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1-85973-872-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, as was the case with [[Greece|Greek]] graphic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, Anne (1993). ''Seeing through clothes." University of California Press. p. 136. {{ISBN|978-0-520-08231-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true in much [[Indian art]], and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe [[Michelangelo]] showed the [[man|male]] [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies remained hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo’s male nudes on the [[Sistine chapel ceiling]] display no pubic hair. In [[Renaissance]] northern Europe, pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, but occasionally female.

By the early 17th century, female pubic hair appear in pornographic drawing and other forms of art, such as those by [[Agostino Carracci]]. By the late 18th century female pubic hair was depicted in Japanese [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] (erotica), especially in the [[ukiyo-e]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, Timon (1999). ''Sex and the floating world: erotic images in Japan, 1700-1820.'' Reaktion Books. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hokusai]]'s picture ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', depicting a woman having an erotic fantasy, is a well-known example. [[Fine art]] paintings and [[sculpture]] created before the 20th century in the Western tradition usually depicted [[Woman|women]] without pubic hair or a visible [[vulva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intimatehair.com/Pubic-Hair---Art_1.html]. Retrieved June 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Goya]]'s [[La Maja Desnuda|''The Nude Maja'']] in the late 18th century has been considered as probably the first European painting to show a woman's pubic hair. The painting was considered pornographic for the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruce|first1=Teresa M|title=Pornophobia, pornophilia, and the need for a middle path|journal=Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law|date=1997|volume=5|issue=2|pages=393–406|url=https://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/genderlaw/05/bruce.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121195746/http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/genderlaw/05/bruce.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave Courbet]]'s ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'' (''The Origin of the World'', 1866), was also considered pornographic because it showed the exposed female genitals in their totality with thick pubic hair.

In more recent times, female adult entertainers who appear nude on stage, film or photography more commonly remove their pubic hair. The presentation is regarded as more erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the appearance as unnatural.

=== Literature ===
In the erotic novel ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]'' the narrator "Walter", an evident connoisseur of female pubic hair, talks with clear delight of a fine bush of a [[Scotswoman|Scotswoman's]] thick red pubic hair:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The bush was long and thick, twisting and curling in masses half-way up to her navel, and it spread about up her buttocks, gradually getting shorter there."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another part of his autobiography Walter remarks that he has seen those "bare of hair, those with but hairy stubble, those with bushes six inches long, covering them from bum bone to navel." And he adds reflectively – "there is not much that I have not seen, felt or tried, with respect to this supreme female article."

In like vein, in the "[[The Memoirs of Dolly Morton|Memories of Dolly Morton]]", an American erotic classic, the attributes of Miss Dean are noted with some surprise (she is stripped and beaten for helping runaway slaves) – her spot was covered with a "thick forest of glossy dark brown hair," with locks nearly two inches long. One man remarked,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But Gosh! I've never seen such a fleece between a woman's legs in my life. Darn me if she wouldn't have to be sheared before man could get into her."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book relates the misadventures of Dolly Morton and her companion Miss Dove who venture into the [[Southern United States|American South]] to help with an [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Erotique noire | first1=Miriam | last1=DeCosta-Willis | first2=Reginald | last2=Martin | first3=Roseann P. | last3=Bell | publisher=Doubleday | year=1992 | isbn=0-385-42308-X | page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[wikt:Special:Search/capture|captured]], [[flagellated]] and [[raped]], and Dolly Morton is forced to be the [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of a plantation owner.&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite book | author=Library Company of Philadelphia | title= 1995 Annual Report | publisher=Library Company of Philadelphia | isbn=1-4223-6128-4 | year=1996 | page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is written as the memoirs of Dolly Morton after she has become a [[madam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Joseph W. | last=Slade | title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=2001 | isbn=0-313-31519-1 | page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society ==
Among the upper class in 19th century [[Victorian Britain]], pubic hair from a lover was frequently collected as a souvenir. The curls were, for instance, worn like [[cockade]]s in men's hats as potency talismans, or exchanged among lovers as tokens of affection.&lt;ref name="Slate 2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2238342/entry/2238343/|title=Secrets of the Great British Sex Clubs|last=Perrottet|first=Tony|date=December 14, 2009|work=[[Slate Magazine]]|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum of [[St. Andrews University]] in Scotland has in its collection a [[snuff box]] full of pubic hair of one of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]'s mistresses, possibly [[Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham|Elizabeth Conyngham]], which the notoriously lascivious monarch donated to the [[Fife]] sex club, [[The Beggar's Benison]].&lt;ref name="Slate 2009" /&gt;

Within the contemporary gay community, so-called ''[[Bear (gay culture)|bears]]'' have a distinctive preference for all types of male body hair, including pubic hair, as the shaving/waxing ("[[Manscaping]]") of any part of a man's body is generally frowned upon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Pubic Hair Female and Vagina Labeled infographic.png|thumb|Female pubic hair and [[vulva]] labeled infographics|330px]]
Pubic hair covers the frontal genital area of adult females and males and adolescent females and males, as pubic hair is located on and around the [[sex organ]]s of females and males, the [[groin|crotch]], and on the inner-[[thigh]]s (or [[femur]]) at the top of the inside of the legs; these areas form the [[urogenital triangle|urogenital triangle pubic hair region]] and [[Hypogastrium|hypogastrium pubic hair region]] around the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis bone]]. Although fine [[vellus hair]] is present in the area in adolescent, pubic hair is heavier, longer and coarser hair that develops during [[puberty]] as an effect of rising levels of [[androgen]]s. Pubic hair is an [[androgenic hair]] (or body hair) and is a [[secondary sex characteristic]].&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt;

Male and female pubic hair texture varies from tightly curled to entirely straight. Also, pubic hair varies in colour as pubic hair does not always match head-hair.  Curly or wavy pubic hair is common, even if head-hair is straight, although in the [[far east]] where black straight head-hair is common it is matched by pubic hair that can be described as 'black, short, straight and not thick but rather sparse'.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherrow&gt;Sherrow, Victoria (2006). ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pubic hair patterns can also vary due to [[genetic admixture]] and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt; Patterns of pubic hair vary between sexes. On the majority of females, the pubic hair patch is triangular and lies over the [[vulva]] and [[mons pubis]]. On the majority of males, the pubic hair patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the [[navel]] (see [[abdominal hair]]), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle.&lt;ref name=sherrow/&gt; As with [[underarm hair]] (or auxiliary hair), pubic hair is associated with a concentration of [[sebaceous gland]]s in the area.

{{sociology}}
'''Rational-legal authority''' (also known as '''rational authority''', '''legal authority''', '''rational domination''', '''legal domination''', or '''bureaucratic authority''') is a form of [[leadership]] in which the [[authority]] of an [[organization]] or a ruling [[regime]] is largely tied to legal [[rationality]], [[Legitimacy (political science)|legal legitimacy]] and [[bureaucracy]]. The majority of the modern [[State (polity)|states]] of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification.

==Rational-legal authority==
In [[sociology]], the concept of rational-legal domination comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]] (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being [[traditional authority]] and [[charismatic authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of [[bureaucracy]] and [[legality]].

==Legal rationality and legitimate authority ==
Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]]).

Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|legitimate use of physical force]].

If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered "legitimate authority". 
* An example of this type of authority would be the viewing of a police car in our rear view mirrors.

== Max Weber's theory: type of authority ==
Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions.

=== 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds ===

* Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals because of two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have.
* Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation.
* Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order.

=== 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds ===

* Acquire from law and is constructed from the reliance of society's rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, rules that are in the constitution, or policies that are written in a formal document.
* Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucr
* Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber's rational leadership prevails in decision making.

=== 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds ===

* Comes from individuals and their personal qualities that they have to offer. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The "charismatic" individuals exercise power and authority over a whole society or even a specific group of within a bigger society. The exercise of their power of these individuals are either for good or bad. Examples of these charismatic leaders can range from: Joan of Arc to Adolf Hitler or Martin Luther king Jr to Jesus Christ.
* Charismatic authority has no clear structure. It is based one's individual influence.  One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power.
* In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line.

==Emergence of the modern state==
Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see [[traditional authority]]) uniquely in the [[Western culture|Occidental civilization]]. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are:
* Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force
* Monopolization of legislative
* Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority

Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were
* Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various [[status class|status groups]] in the [[Western world|Occident]] promoted that emergence)
* Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required
** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants)
** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks
** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration.

Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in [[History of China|Imperial China]] has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century.

==Modern state==
According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has:
* An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role
* Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction
* The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction

An important attribute of Weber's definition of a modern state was that it is a [[bureaucracy]].

The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category.

==Rational-legal leaders==
The majority of modern [[bureaucrat|bureaucratic officials]] and [[politician|political leaders]] represent this type of authority.

&lt;u&gt;Officials:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are personally free.
* Serve a higher authority.
* Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications.
* Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks.
* Their work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement.

&lt;u&gt;Politicians:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are solely responsible for independent action.
* Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected.
* Should have [[charismatic authority|charismatic appeal]] to win [[election]]s under conditions of [[universal suffrage]].
&lt;u&gt;Additional, Weber provided ten necessities addressing: "how individual officials are appointed and work". The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style.&lt;/u&gt;

# They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation.
# They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices.
# Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense.
# The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection.
# Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification.
# They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions.
# The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent.
# It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors.
# The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position.
# He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office.

[[File:Rowett Institute - geograph.org.uk - 23214.jpg|thumb|The Reid Library at the old Bucksburn site]]
The '''Rowett Institute for Nutrition and Health''' is a research centre for studies into [[Food science|food]] and [[nutrition]], located in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.

==History==
The institute was founded in 1913 when the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural College|North of Scotland College of Agriculture]] agreed that an "Institute for Research into Animal Nutrition" should be established in Scotland. The first director was [[John Boyd Orr]], later to become '''Lord Boyd Orr''', who moved from [[Glasgow]] to "the wilds of Aberdeenshire" in 1914. Orr drew up some plans for a nutrition research institute. Orr also donated £5000 for the building of a granite [[laboratory]] building at Craibstone, not far from the Bucksburn site of the Rowett.

At the breakout of the [[Great War]], Orr left the Institute, but returned in 1919 with a staff of four to begin work in the new laboratory. Orr continued to push for a new research institute and finally the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]] agreed to pay half the costs but stipulated that the other half was to be found from other sources. The extra money was donated by Dr [[John Quiller Rowett]], a [[businessman]] and [[board of directors|director]] of a wine and spirits merchants in London. 

Rowett's donation allowed the purchase of  41 [[acre]]s of land for the Institute to be built on. Rowett also contributed £10,000 towards the cost of the buildings. The money was donated with one very important stipulation from Rowett — "if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition were found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work." The Institute was formally opened in 1922 by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].

On 1 July 2008 the Institute merged with the [[University of Aberdeen]] to become the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, College of Life Sciences and Medicine.

In March 2016 the Rowett Institute relocated to a purpose-built building at the University's Medical School campus at Foresterhill, Aberdeen.

Arai is a Doctor of Theology Professor emeritus of [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Keisen University]], and a member of the [[Japan Academy]]. He graduated (1962) at Erlangen-Nürnberg University in Germany.

He and his wife (and daughter Keiko) lived in the early 1960s with the family of the later Bishop of Bavaria and President of the Lutheran World Congress, Dr. Johannes Hanselmann, in Grub am Forst, Oberfranken, Germany.

Arai was a pioneer of the studies of Gnosticism after the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].

'''Sketch Engine''' is a corpus manager and [[text analysis]] software developed by Lexical Computing Limited since 2003. Its purpose is to enable people studying language behaviour ([[lexicographers]], researchers in  [[corpus linguistics]], translators or language learners) to search large text collections according to complex and linguistically motivated queries. Sketch Engine gained its name after one of the key features, [[word sketch]]es: one-page, automatic, corpus-derived summaries of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Baisa|first2=Vít|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Jakubíček|first4=Miloš|last5=Kovář|first5=Vojtěch|last6=Michelfeit|first6=Jan|last7=Rychlý|first7=Pavel|last8=Suchomel|first8=Vít|title=The Sketch Engine: ten years on|journal=Lexicography|date=10 July 2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–36|doi=10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|issn=2197-4292|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it supports and provides corpora in 90+ languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/user-guide/user-manual/corpora/by-language/ |title= Languages in Sketch Engine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of development ==
Sketch Engine is a product of Lexical Computing Limited, a company founded in 2003 by the lexicographer and research scientist [[Adam Kilgarriff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kilgarriff.co.uk Adam Kilgarriff's home page]&lt;/ref&gt; He started collaboration with Pavel Rychlý, a computer scientist working at the Natural Language Processing Centre at [[Masaryk University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz Natural Language Processing Centre, Masaryk University]&lt;/ref&gt; and the developer of Manatee and Bonito (two major parts of the software suite), and introduced the concept of [[word sketch]]es.

Since then, Sketch Engine has been commercial software, however all the core features of Manatee and Bonito that were developed by 2003 (and extended since then) are freely available under the [[GPL]] license within the NoSketch Engine suite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske NoSketch Engine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
* [[Word sketch]]es – a one-page automatic derived summary of a word’s grammatical and collocational behaviour
* Word sketch difference – compares and contrasts two words by analysing their collocation
* Distributional [[Thesaurus]] – automated thesaurus finding words with similar meaning or appearing in the same/similar context
* [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] search – finds examples of a word form, lemma, phrase, tag or complex structure
* [[Collocation]] search – word co-occurrence analysis displaying the most frequent words (to a search word) which can be regarded as collocation candidates
* Word lists – generates frequency lists which can be filtered with complex criteria
* [[n-gram]]s – generates frequency lists of multi-word expressions
* [[Terminology extraction|Terminology]] / [[Keyword (linguistics)|Keyword]] extraction (both monolingual and bilingual) – automatic extraction key words and multi-word terms from texts (based on frequency count and linguistic criteria)
* Diachronic analysis ([[Trend analysis|Trends]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Herman|first2=Ondřej|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Jakubíček|first5=Miloš|title=DIACRAN: a framework for diachronic analysis|journal=Corpus Linguistics 2015|date=2015|pages=65–70|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Diacran_CL2015.pdf|publisher=Lancaster: UCREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; – detecting words which undergo changes in the frequency of use in time (show trending words)
* Corpus building and management – create corpora from the Web or uploaded texts including [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[lemmatization]] which can be used as [[data mining]] software
* [[Parallel corpus]] (bilingual) facilities – looking up translation examples (EUR-Lex corpus, [[Europarl corpus]], OPUS corpus, etc.) or building parallel corpus from own aligned texts

== Architecture ==
[[File:Thesaurus in Sketch Engine.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Sketch Engine thesaurus page|Thesaurus cloud of the lemma ''work'' in Sketch Engine]]

Sketch Engine consists of three main components: an underlying [[database management system]] called Manatee, a web interface search front-end called Bonito and a web interface for corpus building and management called Corpus Architect.
&lt;ref name="bonito"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|title=Manatee/bonito–a modular corpus manager|journal=1st Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2007|pages=65–70|url=http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/2007/raslan07.pdf#page=73|publisher=Masaryk University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manatee ===

Manatee is a [[database management system]] specifically devised for effective indexing of large text corpora. It is based on the idea of [[inverted index]]ing (keeping an index of all positions of a given word in the text). It has been used to index text corpora comprising tens of billions of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pomikálek|first1=Jan|last2=Jakubíček|first2=Miloš|last3=Rychlý|first3=Pavel|title=Building a 70 billion word corpus of English from ClueWeb|journal=Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'12)|date=2012|url=http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/1047_Paper.pdf|publisher=European Language Resources Association (ELRA)|location=Istanbul, Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searching corpora indexed by Manatee is performed by formulating queries in the Corpus Query Language (CQL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/ |title=CQL – Corpus Query Language |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manatee is written in [[C++]] and offers an [[API]] for a number of other programming languages including [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Recently, it was rewritten into [[Go (programming language)|Go]] for faster processing of corpus queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|last2=Rábara|first2=Radoslav|title=Concurrent Processing of Text Corpus Queries|journal=Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2015|pages=49–58|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Concurrent_Processing_2015.pdf|publisher=Masaryk University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bonito ===

Bonito is a web interface for Manatee providing access to corpus search. In the [[client–server model]], Manatee is the server and Bonito plays the client part. It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref name="bonito" /&gt;

=== Corpus Architect ===

Corpus Architect is a web interface providing corpus building and management features. It is also written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

== Applications ==
Sketch Engine has been used by major British or other publishing houses for producing dictionaries such as [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]], [[Dictionnaires Le&amp;nbsp;Robert]], [[Oxford University Press]] or [[Shogakukan]] and four of the UK’s five biggest dictionary publishers use Sketch Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=39760 |title=Using Computational Lexicography for Dictionary Production with the Sketch Engine

{{For|the ranking system, e.g. "four out of five stars"|Star (classification)}}
{{star nav}}

In [[astronomy]], '''stellar classification''' is the classification of [[star]]s based on their [[stellar spectrum|spectral]] characteristics. [[Electromagnetic radiation]] from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a [[prism]] or [[diffraction grating]] into a [[spectrum]] exhibiting the [[Continuum (spectrum)|rainbow]] of colors interspersed with [[spectral line]]s. Each line indicates a particular [[chemical element]] or [[molecule]], with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element. The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the [[photosphere]], although in some cases there are true abundance differences. The ''spectral class'' of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the [[ionization]] state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature.

Most stars are currently classified under the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system using the letters ''O'', ''B'', ''A'', ''F'', ''G'', ''K'', and ''M'', a sequence from the hottest (''O'' type) to the coolest (''M'' type). Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with ''0'' being hottest and ''9'' being coolest (e.g. A8, A9, F0, and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler). The sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the classical system, such as class&amp;nbsp;''D'' for [[white dwarf]]s and classes&amp;nbsp;''S'' and ''C'' for [[carbon star]]s.

In the MK system, a [[luminosity class]] is added to the spectral class using [[Roman numerals]]. This is based on the width of certain absorption lines in the star's spectrum, which vary with the density of the atmosphere and so distinguish giant stars from dwarfs. Luminosity class&amp;nbsp;''0'' or ''Ia+'' is used for ''hypergiants'', class&amp;nbsp;''I'' for ''supergiants'', class&amp;nbsp;''II'' for bright ''giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''III'' for regular ''giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''IV'' for ''sub-giants'', class&amp;nbsp;''V'' for ''[[main-sequence]] stars'', class&amp;nbsp;''sd'' (or ''VI'') for ''sub-dwarfs'', and class&amp;nbsp;''D'' (or ''VII'') for ''white dwarfs''. The full spectral class for the [[Sun]] is then G2V, indicating a main-sequence star with a temperature around 5,800&amp;nbsp;K.

==Conventional color description==
{{Main|Green star (astronomy)}}
[[File:TernaryColorTmap.PNG|thumb|Just-saturated RGB-camera discs]]

The conventional color description takes into account only the peak of the stellar spectrum. In actuality, however, stars radiate in all parts of the spectrum. Because all spectral colors combined appear white, the actual apparent colors the human eye would observe are far lighter than the conventional color descriptions would suggest. This characteristic of 'lightness' indicates that the simplified assignment of colors within the spectrum can be misleading. Excluding color-contrast illusions in dim light, there are no green, indigo, or violet stars. [[Red dwarf]]s are a deep shade of orange, and [[brown dwarf]]s do not literally appear brown, but hypothetically would appear dim grey to a nearby observer.

==Modern classification{{anchor|MK}}==
[[File:Morgan-Keenan spectral classification.png|thumb|The Morgan–Keenan spectral classification]]

The modern classification system is known as the ''Morgan–Keenan'' (MK) classification. Each star is assigned a spectral class from the older Harvard spectral classification and a luminosity class using Roman numerals as explained below, forming the star's spectral type.

Other modern [[photometric system|stellar classification systems]], such as the [[UBV photometric system|UBV system]], are based on [[color index]]es—the measured differences in three or more [[Magnitude (astronomy)|color magnitude]]s. Those numbers are given labels such as "U-V" or "B-V", which represent the colors passed by two standard filters (e.g. ''U''ltraviolet, ''B''lue and ''V''isual).

===Harvard spectral classification===
The ''Harvard system'' is a one-dimensional classification scheme by astronomer [[Annie Jump Cannon]], who re-ordered and simplified a prior alphabetical system. Stars are grouped according to their spectral characteristics by single letters of the alphabet, optionally with numeric subdivisions. Main-sequence stars vary in surface temperature from approximately 2,000 to 50,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], whereas more-evolved stars can have temperatures above 100,000&amp;nbsp;K. Physically, the classes indicate the temperature of the star's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest.

[[File:H-R diagram.svg|thumb|The [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] relates stellar classification with [[absolute magnitude]], [[luminosity]], and surface [[temperature]].]]

The spectral classes O through M, as well as other more specialized classes discussed later, are subdivided by [[Arabic numerals]] (0–9), where 0 denotes the hottest stars of a given class. For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in class&amp;nbsp;A and A9 denotes the coolest ones. Fractional numbers are allowed; for example, the star [[Mu Normae]] is classified as O9.7.&lt;ref name="UpsOriType"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS). II.

Conventional color descriptions are traditional in astronomy, and represent colors relative to the mean color of an A&amp;nbsp;class star, which is considered to be white. The apparent color&lt;ref name="möre"/&gt; descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.

The fact that the Harvard classification of a star indicated its surface or [[Photosphere|photospheric]] [[temperature]] (or more precisely, its [[effective temperature]]) was not fully understood until after its development, though by the time the first [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] was formulated (by 1914), this was generally suspected to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Relations Between the Spectra and Other Characteristics of the Stars |magazine=Popular Astronomy |last=Russell |first=Henry Norris |volume=22 |pages=275–294 |date=March 1914 |bibcode=1914PA.....22..275R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]] derived a theory of ionization by extending well-known ideas in physical chemistry pertaining to the dissociation of molecules to the ionization of atoms. First he applied it to the solar chromosphere, then to stellar spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On a Physical Theory of Stellar Spectra |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A |last=Saha |first=M. N. |volume=99 |issue=697 |pages=135–153 |date=May 1921 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1921.0029 |bibcode=1921RSPSA..99..135S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard astronomer [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin|Cecilia Payne]] then demonstrated that the ''O-B-A-F-G-K-M'' spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Stellar Atmospheres; a Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars |publisher=Radcliffe College |first=Cecilia Helena |last=Payne |type=Ph.D |date=1925 |bibcode=1925PhDT.........1P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the classification sequence predates our understanding that it is a temperature sequence, the placement of a spectrum into a given subtype, such as B3 or A7, depends upon (largely subjective) estimates of the strengths of absorption features in stellar spectra. As a result, these subtypes are not evenly divided into any sort of mathematically representable intervals.

Hydrogen lines are strongest for types A and B, and the overall spectrum peaks at shorter wavelengths for hotter stars.]]

The ''Yerkes spectral classification'', also called the ''MKK'' system from the authors' initials, is a system of stellar spectral classification introduced in 1943 by [[William Wilson Morgan]], [[Philip Childs Keenan|Philip C. Keenan]], and [[Edith Kellman]] from [[Yerkes Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |first1=William Wilson |last1=Morgan |first2=Philip Childs |last2=Keenan |first3=Edith |last3=Kellman |date=1943 |bibcode=1943assw.book.....M |oclc=1806249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-dimensional ([[temperature]] and [[luminosity]]) classification scheme is based on [[spectral line]]s sensitive to stellar temperature and [[surface gravity]], which is related to luminosity (whilst the ''Harvard classification'' is based on just surface temperature). Later, in 1953, after some revisions of list of standard stars and classification criteria, the scheme was named the ''Morgan–Keenan classification'', or ''MK'',&lt;ref name="ref_MK"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Spectral Classification |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |first1=William Wilson |last1=Morgan |first2=Philip Childs |last2=Keenan |volume=11 |pages=29–50 |date=1973 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.11.090173.000333 |bibcode=1973ARA&amp;A..11...29M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this system remains in use.

Denser stars with higher surface gravity exhibit greater [[pressure broadening]] of spectral lines. The gravity, and hence the pressure, on the surface of a [[giant star]] is much lower than for a [[dwarf star]] because the radius of the giant is much greater than a dwarf of similar mass. Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as ''luminosity effects'' and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum.

A number of different ''luminosity classes'' are distinguished, as listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="CDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pberlind/atlas/htmls/note.html |title=A note on the spectral atlas and spectral classification |publisher=[[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginal cases are allowed; for example, a star may be either a supergiant or a bright giant, or may be in between the subgiant and main-sequence classifications. 
In these cases, two special symbols are used:
*A slash ('''/''') means that a star is either one class or the other.
*A dash ('''-''') means that the star is in between the two classes.

For example, a star classified as A3-4III/IV would be in between spectral types A3 and A4, while being either a giant star or a subgiant.

Sub-dwarf classes have also been used: VI for sub-dwarfs (stars slightly less luminous than the main sequence).

Nominal luminosity class&amp;nbsp;VII (and sometimes higher numerals) is now rarely used for white dwarf or "hot sub-dwarf" classes, since the temperature-letters of the main sequence and giant stars no longer apply to white dwarfs.

Occasionally, letters ''a'' and ''b'' are applied to luminosity classes other than supergiants; for example, a giant star slightly more luminous than typical may be given a luminosity class of IIIb.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=An Encoding System to Represent Stellar Spectral Classes in Archival Databases and Catalogs |eprint=1112.3617 |last1=Smith |first1=Myron A. |last2=Thompson |first2=Randall W. |last3=Gray |first3=Richard O. |last4=Corbally |first4=Christopher |last5=Kamp |first5=Inga |display-authors=1 |class=astro-ph.SR |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The reason for the odd arrangement of letters in the Harvard classification is historical, having evolved from the earlier Secchi classes and been progressively modified as understanding improved.

===Secchi classes===
During the 1860s and 1870s, pioneering stellar spectroscopist [[Angelo Secchi]] created the ''Secchi classes'' in order to classify observed spectra. By 1866, he had developed three classes of stellar spectra, shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30204/f364.table Analyse spectrale de la lumière de quelques étoiles, et nouvelles observations sur les taches solaires], P.

Secchi, ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences'' '''63''' (July–December 1866), pp. 621–628.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hearnshaw |first=J.

In the late 1890s, this classification began to be superseded by the Harvard classification, which is discussed in the remainder of this article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~gott/AST1002/Additional_Notes/Add_notes.week5 Classification of Stellar Spectra: Some History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaler |first=James B. |date=1997 |title=Stars and Their Spectra: An Introduction to the Spectral Sequence |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=62–63 |isbn=0-521-58570-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 60–63, Hearnshaw 1986; pp. 623–625, Secchi 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, the astronomer [[Edward C. Pickering]] began to make a survey of stellar spectra at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], using the objective-prism method. A first result of this work was the ''Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra'', published in 1890. [[Williamina Fleming]] classified most of the spectra in this catalogue.

The catalogue used a scheme in which the previously used Secchi classes (I to IV) were subdivided into more specific classes, given letters from A to N. Also, the letters O, P, and Q were used &amp;ndash; O for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines, P for planetary nebulae, and Q for stars not fitting into any other class.&lt;ref name="drapera"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1890AnHar..27....1P |title=The Draper Catalogue of stellar spectra photographed with the 8-inch Bache telescope as a part of the Henry Draper memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=27 |pages=1 |author1=Pickering |first1=Edward C. |year=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="draperb"&gt;pp. 106–108, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard system===
In 1897, another worker at Harvard, [[Antonia Maury]], placed the Orion subtype of Secchi class&amp;nbsp;I ahead of the remainder of Secchi class&amp;nbsp;I, thus placing the modern type&amp;nbsp;B ahead of the modern type&amp;nbsp;A. She was the first to do so, although she did not use lettered spectral types, but rather a series of twenty-two types numbered from I to XXII.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 111–112, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1897AnHar..28....1M |title=Spectra of bright stars photographed with the 11&amp;nbsp;inch Draper Telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=28 |pages=1 |author1=Maury |first1=Antonia C. |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward C. |year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] returned to the lettered types, but dropped all letters except O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, used in that order, as well as P for planetary nebulae and Q for some peculiar spectra. She also used types such as B5A for stars halfway between types B and A, F2G for stars one-fifth of the way from F to G, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1901AnHar..28..129C |title=Spectra of bright southern stars photographed with the 13&amp;nbsp;inch Boyden telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory |volume=28 |pages=129 |author1=Cannon |first1=Annie J. |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward C. |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;117–119, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, by 1912, Cannon had changed the types B, A, B5A, F2G, etc. to B0, A0, B5, F2, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1912AnHar..56..115C |title=Classification of 1,688 southern stars by means of their spectra |journal=Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College |volume=56 |pages=115 |author1=Cannon |first1=Annie Jump |last2=Pickering |first2=Edward Charles |year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 121–122, Hearnshaw 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially the modern form of the Harvard classification system.

A common [[mnemonic]] for remembering the order of the spectral type letters, from hottest to coolest, is "Oh, Be A Fine Guy/Girl, Kiss Me".

==Spectral types==
The stellar classification system is [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]], based on [[Type (biology)|type specimens]], similar to classification of species in [[biology]]: The categories are defined by one or more standard stars for each category and sub-category, with an associated description of the distinguishing features.&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt;

==="Early" and "late" nomenclature===
Stars are often referred to as ''early'' or ''late'' types. "Early" is a synonym for ''hotter'', while "late" is a synonym for ''cooler''.

Depending on the context, "early" and "late" may be absolute or relative terms. "Early" as an absolute term would therefore refer to O or B, and possibly A stars. As a relative reference it relates to stars hotter than others, such as "early K" being perhaps K0, K1, and K3.

"Late" is used in the same way, with an unqualified use of the term indicating stars with spectral types such as K and M, but it can also be used for stars that are cool relative to other stars, as in using "late G" to refer to G7, G8, and G9.

In the relative sense, "early" means a lower Arabic numeral following the class letter, and "late" means a higher number.

This obscure terminology is a hold-over from an early 20th&amp;nbsp;century model of stellar evolution, which supposed that stars were powered by gravitational contraction via the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]], which is now known to not apply to [[main sequence]] stars. If that were true, then stars would start their lives as very hot "early-type" stars and then gradually cool down into "late-type" stars. This mechanism provided ages of the [[Sun]] that were much smaller than what is observed in the [[geologic record]], and was rendered obsolete by the discovery that stars are powered by [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/latetype.html |title=late-type star |first=David |last=Darling |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |accessdate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "early" and "late" were carried over, beyond the demise of the model they were based on.

===Class O===
{{Main|O-type star}}
{{See also|O-type main-sequence star|Blue giant|Blue supergiant}}
[[File:Zeta Puppis.png|thumb|Artist's rendering of [[Zeta Puppis]], an O4 supergiant]]

O-type stars are very hot and extremely luminous, with most of their radiated output in the [[ultraviolet]] range. These are the rarest of all main-sequence stars. About 1 in 3,000,000 (0.00003%) of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are O-type stars.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"&gt;These proportions are fractions of stars brighter than absolute magnitude&amp;nbsp;16; lowering this limit will render earlier types even rarer, whereas generally adding only to the M class.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Real Starry Sky |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |last=Ledrew |first=Glenn |volume=95 |page=32 |date=February 2001 |bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[List of most massive stars|most massive stars]] lie within this spectral class. O-type stars frequently have complicated surroundings that make measurement of their spectra difficult.

O-type spectra formerly were defined by the ratio of the strength of the [[Helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II λ4541 relative to that of He&amp;nbsp;I λ4471, where λ is the [[wavelength]], measured in [[ångström]]s. Spectral type O7 was defined to be the point at which the two intensities are equal, with the He&amp;nbsp;I line weakening towards earlier types. Type&amp;nbsp;O3 was, by definition, the point at which said line disappears altogether, although it can be seen very faintly with modern technology. Due to this, the modern definition uses the ratio of the [[nitrogen]] line N&amp;nbsp;IV λ4058 to N&amp;nbsp;III λλ4634-40-42.&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt;

O-type stars have dominant lines of absorption and sometimes emission for [[helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II lines, prominent ionized ([[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;IV, [[oxygen|O]]&amp;nbsp;III, [[nitrogen|N]]&amp;nbsp;III, and [[carbon|C]]&amp;nbsp;III) and neutral [[helium]] lines, strengthening from O5 to O9, and prominent hydrogen [[Balmer lines]], although not as strong as in later types. Because they are so massive, O-type stars have very hot cores and burn through their hydrogen fuel very quickly, so they are the first stars to leave the [[main sequence]].

When the MKK classification scheme was first described in 1943, the only subtypes of class&amp;nbsp;O used were O5 to O9.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ASS_Atlas/frames.html ''An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification''], W. W. Morgan, P. C. Keenan and E.

===Class B===
{{See also|B-type main-sequence star|Blue giant|Blue supergiant}}
[[File:Eta CMa.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of [[Eta Canis Majoris|Aludra]], a B5 [[supergiant]] seen in [[Canis Major]].]]

B-type stars are very luminous and blue. Their spectra have neutral helium lines, which are most prominent at the B2 subclass, and moderate hydrogen lines. As [[OB star|O- and B-type stars]] are so energetic, they only live for a relatively short time. Thus, due to the low probability of kinematic interaction during their lifetime, they are unable to stray far from the area in which they formed, apart from [[runaway star]]s.

The transition from class&amp;nbsp;O to class&amp;nbsp;B was originally defined to be the point at which the [[Helium|He]]&amp;nbsp;II λ4541 disappears. However, with modern equipment, the line is still apparent in the early B-type stars. Today for main-sequence stars, the B-class is instead defined by the intensity of the He&amp;nbsp;I violet spectrum, with the maximum intensity corresponding to class&amp;nbsp;B2. For supergiants, lines of [[silicon]] are used instead; the Si&amp;nbsp;IV λ4089 and Si&amp;nbsp;III λ4552 lines are indicative of early B. At mid B, the intensity of the latter relative to that of Si&amp;nbsp;II λλ4128-30 is the defining characteristic, while for late B, it is the intensity of Mg&amp;nbsp;II λ4481 relative to that of He&amp;nbsp;I λ4471.&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt;

These stars tend to be found in their originating [[OB association]]s, which are associated with giant [[molecular cloud]]s. The Orion OB1 association occupies a large portion of a [[spiral arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] and contains many of the brighter stars of the [[Orion constellation|constellation Orion]]. About 1 in 800 (0.125%) of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are [[B-type main-sequence star]]s.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt;

Massive yet non-[[supergiant]] entities known as "Be&amp;nbsp;stars" are main-sequence stars that notably have, or had at some time, one or more [[Balmer lines]] in emission, with the [[hydrogen]]-related [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[Hydrogen spectral series|series]] projected out by the stars being of particular interest. Be stars are generally thought to feature unusually strong [[stellar wind]]s, high surface temperatures, and significant attrition of [[stellar mass]] as the objects [[Stellar rotation|rotate]] at a curiously rapid rate.&lt;ref name="Slettebak1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Be Stars |journal=[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |first=Arne |last=Slettebak |volume=100 |pages=770–784 |date=July 1988 |doi=10.1086/132234 |bibcode=1988PASP..100..770S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects known as [[B(e) star|"B(e)" or "B[e]" stars]] possess distinctive neutral or low ionisation [[emission lines]] that are considered to have '[[forbidden mechanism]]s', undergoing processes not normally allowed under current understandings of [[quantum mechanics]].

A-type stars are among the more common naked eye stars, and are white or bluish-white.

The presence of [[calcium|Ca]]&amp;nbsp;II lines is notably strengthening by this point.

G-type stars, including the [[Sun]]&lt;ref name="SunSpectrum"/&gt; have prominent spectral lines ''H'' and ''K'' of [[calcium|Ca]]&amp;nbsp;II, which are most pronounced at G2. They have even weaker hydrogen lines than F, but along with the ionized metals, they have neutral metals. There is a prominent spike in the G band of [[cyanide|CH]] molecules.

K-type stars are orangish stars that are slightly cooler than the Sun. They make up about 12% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt; There are also giant K-type stars, which range from [[hypergiant]]s like [[RW Cephei]], to [[Giant star|giants]] and [[supergiant]]s, such as [[Arcturus]], whereas [[K-type main-sequence star|orange dwarfs]], like [[Alpha Centauri]]&amp;nbsp;B, are main-sequence stars.

They have extremely weak hydrogen lines, if they are present at all, and mostly neutral metals ([[manganese|Mn]]&amp;nbsp;I, [[iron|Fe]]&amp;nbsp;I, [[silicon|Si]]&amp;nbsp;I). By late K, molecular bands of [[titanium monoxide|titanium oxide]] become present.

[[File:UY Scuti zoomed in, Rutherford Observatory, 07 September 2014.jpeg|thumb|[[UY Scuti]], an M4 supergiant]]

Class&amp;nbsp;M stars are by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are class&amp;nbsp;M stars.&lt;ref group="nb" name="proportions"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This rises to 78.6% if we include all stars. (See the above note.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDrew2001"/&gt; However, class&amp;nbsp;M main-sequence stars ([[red dwarf]]s) have such low luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional conditions. The brightest known M-class main-sequence star is M0V [[Lacaille 8760]], with [[stellar magnitude|magnitude]] 6.6 (the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye visibility under good conditions is typically quoted as 6.5), and it is extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found.

Although most class&amp;nbsp;M stars are red dwarfs, most of the largest ever supergiant stars in the Milky Way are M stars. such as [[VY Canis Majoris]], [[Antares]] and [[Betelgeuse]] are also class&amp;nbsp;M. Furthermore, the larger, hotter [[brown dwarf]]s are late class&amp;nbsp;M, usually in the range of M6.5 to M9.5.

The spectrum of a class&amp;nbsp;M star contains lines from [[oxide]] [[molecule]]s (in the [[visible spectrum]], especially [[titanium monoxide|TiO]]) and all neutral metals, but absorption lines of hydrogen are usually absent. TiO bands can be strong in class&amp;nbsp;M stars, usually dominating their visible spectrum by about M5. [[Vanadium(II) oxide]] bands become present by late M.

Class&amp;nbsp;W or WR represents the [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s, notable for spectra lacking hydrogen lines. Instead their spectra are dominated by broad emission lines of highly ionized helium, nitrogen, carbon and sometimes oxygen. They are thought to mostly be dying supergiants with their hydrogen layers blown away by [[stellar wind]]s, thereby directly exposing their hot helium shells. Class&amp;nbsp;W is further divided into subclasses according to the relative strength of nitrogen and carbon emission lines in their spectra (and outer layers).&lt;ref name=WR&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007ARA&amp;A..45..177C |title=Physical Properties of Wolf-Rayet Stars |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=45 |pages=177–219 |author1=Crowther |first1=Paul A. |year=2007 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.45.051806.110615 |arxiv=astro-ph/0610356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The "Slash" stars====
{{Main|Slash star}}
The ''slash'' stars are O-type stars with WN-like lines in their spectra. The name "slash" comes from their printed spectral type having a slash in it (e.g. "Of/WNL"&lt;ref name="Walborn"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008RMxAC..33....5W |title=Multiwavelength Systematics of OB Spectra |journal=Massive Stars: Fundamental Parameters and Circumstellar Interactions (Eds. P. Benaglia |volume=33 |pages=5 |author1=Walborn |first1=N. R. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There is a secondary group found with this spectra, a cooler, "intermediate" group designated "Ofpe/WN9".&lt;ref name="Walborn"/&gt; These stars have also been referred to as WN10 or WN11, but that has become less popular with the realisation of the evolutionary difference from other Wolf–Rayet stars. Recent discoveries of even rarer stars have extended the range of slash stars as far as O2-3.5If&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/WN5-7, which are even hotter than the original "slash" stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crowther |first1=P.

===Cool red and brown dwarf classes===
{{main|Brown dwarf|Red dwarf}}
The new spectral types L, T, and Y were created to classify infrared spectra of cool stars. This includes both [[red dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s that are very faint in the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008ASPC..384...85K |arxiv=0704.1522 |title=Outstanding Issues in Our Understanding of L, T, and Y Dwarfs |journal=14th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars |volume=384 |pages=85 |author1=Kirkpatrick |first1=J. D. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brown dwarf]]s, whose energy comes from [[gravitational]] attraction alone, cool as they age and so progress to later spectral types. Brown dwarfs start their lives with M-type spectra and will cool through the L, T, and Y spectral classes, faster the less massive they are; the highest-mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled to Y or even T dwarfs within the age of the universe. Because this leads to an unresolvable overlap between spectral types{{'}} [[effective temperature]] and [[luminosity]] for some masses and ages of different L-T-Y types, no distinct [[effective temperature|temperature]] or [[luminosity]] values can be given.&lt;ref name=bdevol&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary models for cool brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets.

====Class L====
[[File:L-dwarf-nasa-hurt.png|thumb|Artist's impression of an L-dwarf]]

Class L dwarfs get their designation because they are cooler than M stars and L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support [[hydrogen fusion]] and are therefore stars, but most are of [[substellar object|substellar]] mass and are therefore brown dwarfs. They are a very dark red in color and brightest in [[infrared]]. Their [[atmosphere]] is cool enough to allow [[metal hydride]]s and [[alkali metal]]s to be prominent in their spectra.&lt;ref name="kirk_ARAA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.

Due to low surface gravity in giant stars, [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]]- and [[Vanadium monoxide|VO]]-bearing condensates never form. Thus, L-type stars larger than dwarfs can never form in an isolated environment. However, it may be possible for these L-type supergiants to form through stellar collisions, an example of which is [[V838 Monocerotis]] while in the height of its [[luminous red nova]] eruption.

====Class T: methane dwarfs{{anchor|Class T}}====
[[File:T-dwarf-nasa-hurt.png|thumb|Artist's impression of a T-dwarf]]

Class&amp;nbsp;T dwarfs are cool [[brown dwarf]]s with surface temperatures between approximately {{convert|550|and|1300|K|C F}}. Their emission peaks in the [[infrared]]. [[Methane]] is prominent in their spectra.&lt;ref name="kirk_ARAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kirk_ApJ"/&gt;

Classes&amp;nbsp;T and L could be more common than all the other classes combined if recent research is accurate. Because brown dwarfs persist for so long—a few times the age of the universe—in the absence of catastrophic collisions these smaller bodies can only increase in number.

Study of the number of [[protoplanetary disk|proplyds]] (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in [[nebula]]e from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the [[galaxy]] should be several [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] higher than what was previously conjectured. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a [[protostar]], which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to us.

Brown dwarfs of spectral class&amp;nbsp;Y are cooler than those of spectral class&amp;nbsp;T and have qualitatively different spectra from them.

The latest brown dwarf proposed for the Y spectral type, [[WISE 1828+2650]], is a &gt;&amp;nbsp;Y2&amp;nbsp;dwarf with an effective temperature originally estimated around 300&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], the temperature of the human body.&lt;ref name="stars-cooler-than-body"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cool-y-dwarf"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eso1110&gt;[[European Southern Observatory]].

The mass range for Y&amp;nbsp;dwarfs is 9–25&amp;nbsp;[[Jupiter]] masses, but young objects might reach below one Jupiter mass, which means that Y class objects straddle the 13&amp;nbsp;Jupiter mass [[deuterium]]-fusion limit that marks the current [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] division between brown dwarfs and planets.&lt;ref name=ydwarfsurvey /&gt;

===Late giant carbon-star classes===
Carbon-stars are stars whose spectra indicate production of carbon—a byproduct of [[Triple-alpha process|triple-alpha]] helium fusion. With increased carbon abundance, and some parallel [[s-process]] heavy element production, the spectra of these stars become increasingly deviant from the usual late spectral classes&amp;nbsp;G, K, and M. Equivalent classes for carbon-rich stars are S and C.

The giants among those stars are presumed to produce this carbon themselves, but some stars in this class are double stars, whose odd atmosphere is suspected of having been transferred from a companion that is now a white dwarf, when the companion was a carbon-star.

====Class C: carbon stars====
{{Main|Carbon star}}
[[File:Curious spiral spotted by ALMA around red giant star R Sculptoris (data visualisation).jpg|thumb|Image of the carbon star [[R Sculptoris]] and its striking spiral structure]]

Originally classified as R and N stars, these are also known as ''carbon stars''. These are red giants, near the end of their lives, in which there is an excess of carbon in the atmosphere. The old R and N classes ran parallel to the normal classification system from roughly mid G to late M. These have more recently been remapped into a unified carbon classifier C with N0 starting at roughly C6. Another subset of cool carbon stars are the C-J&amp;nbsp;type stars, which are characterized by the strong presence of molecules of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]][[cyanide|CN]] in addition to those of [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;]][[cyanide|CN]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouigue, R. (1954). Annales d'Astrophysique, Vol.&amp;nbsp;17, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; A few main-sequence carbon stars are known, but the overwhelming majority of known carbon stars are giants or supergiants. There are several subclasses:
* C-R &amp;ndash; Formerly its own class (''R'') representing the carbon star equivalent of late G to early K-type stars.
* C-N &amp;ndash; Formerly its own class representing the carbon star equivalent of late K to M-type stars.
* C-J &amp;ndash; A subtype of cool C stars with a high content of [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]].
* C-H &amp;ndash; [[Population II]] analogues of the C-R stars.
* C-Hd &amp;ndash; Hydrogen-deficient carbon stars, similar to late G supergiants with [[Methylidyne radical|CH]] and [[diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] bands added.

====Class S====
{{Main|S-type star}}
Class&amp;nbsp;S stars form a continuum between class&amp;nbsp;M stars and carbon stars. Those most similar to class&amp;nbsp;M stars have strong [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] [[spectral bands|absorption bands]] analogous to the [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]] bands of class&amp;nbsp;M stars, whereas those most similar to carbon stars have strong [[Sodium|sodium D line]]s and weak [[Diatomic carbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, P. C. (1954). ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol.&amp;nbsp;120, p.&amp;nbsp;484&lt;/ref&gt; Class&amp;nbsp;S stars have excess amounts of [[zirconium]] and other elements produced by the [[s-process]], and have more similar carbon and oxygen abundances than class&amp;nbsp;M or carbon stars. Like carbon stars, nearly all known class&amp;nbsp;S stars are [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] stars.

The spectral type is formed by the letter&amp;nbsp;S and a number between zero and ten. This number corresponds to the temperature of the star and approximately follows the temperature scale used for class&amp;nbsp;M giants. The most common types are S3 to S5. The non-standard designation S10 has only been used for the star [[Chi Cygni]] when at an extreme minimum.

The basic classification is usually followed by an abundance indication, following one of several schemes: S2,5; S2/5; S2 Zr4 Ti2; or S2*5. A number following a comma is a scale between 1 and 9 based on the ratio of [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] and [[Titanium monoxide|TiO]]. A number following a slash is a more recent but less common scheme designed to represent the ratio of carbon to oxygen on a scale of 1 to 10, where a 0 would be an MS star. Intensities of [[zirconium]] and [[titanium]] may be indicated explicitly. Also occasionally seen is a number following an asterisk, which represents the strength of the [[Zirconium monoxide|ZrO]] bands on a scale from 1 to 5.

====Classes MS and SC: intermediary carbon-related classes====
In between the M and S classes, border cases are named MS stars. In a similar way, border cases between the S and C-N classes are named SC or CS. The sequence M → MS → S → SC → C-N is hypothesized to be a sequence of increased carbon abundance with age for [[carbon star]]s in the [[asymptotic giant branch]].

===White dwarf classifications{{anchor|Class D}}===
{{Main|White dwarf spectroscopy}}
[[File:Sirius A and B Hubble photo.jpg|thumb|[[Sirius]] A and B (a [[white dwarf]] of type DA2) resolved by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]]]]

The class&amp;nbsp;D (for [[Electron-degenerate matter|Degenerate]]) is the modern classification used for white dwarfs – low-mass stars that are no longer undergoing [[nuclear fusion]] and have shrunk to planetary size, slowly cooling down. Class&amp;nbsp;D is further divided into spectral types DA, DB, DC, DO, DQ, DX, and DZ. The letters are not related to the letters used in the classification of other stars, but instead indicate the composition of the white dwarf's visible outer layer or atmosphere.

==Stellar remnants==
{{Main|Neutron star|Black hole|Exotic star}}
Stellar remnants are objects associated with the death of stars. Included in the category are white dwarfs, and as can be seen from the radically different classification scheme for class&amp;nbsp;D, non-stellar objects are difficult to fit into the MK system.

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which the MK system is based on, is observational in nature so these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram, or cannot be placed at all. Old [[neutron star]]s are relatively small and cold, and would fall on the far right side of the diagram. [[Planetary nebula]]e are dynamic and tend to quickly fade in brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the [[white dwarf]] branch. If shown, a planetary nebula would be plotted to the right of the diagram's upper right quadrant. A [[black hole]] emits no visible light of its own, and therefore would not appear on the diagram.&lt;ref name="chan-var-hr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/variable_stars/bg_info.html |title=Pulsating Variable Stars and the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replaced spectral classes==
Several spectral types, all previously used for non-standard stars in the mid-20th century, have been replaced during revisions of the stellar classification system. They may still be found in old editions of star catalogs: R and N have been subsumed into the new C class as C-R and C-N.

{{Area networks}}

A '''storage area network''' ('''SAN''') or '''storage network''' is a [[Computer network]] which provides access to consolidated, [[Block device|block level data storage]]. SANs are primarily used to enhance accessibility of storage devices, such as [[disk array]]s and [[Tape library|tape libraries]], accessible to [[Server (computing)|server]]s so that the devices appear to the [[operating system]] as [[Direct-attached storage|locally attached devices]]. A SAN typically is a dedicated network of storage devices not accessible through the [[local area network]] (LAN) by other devices, thereby preventing interference of LAN traffic in data transfer. 

The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.

A SAN does not provide file abstraction, only block-level operations. However, [[file systems]] built on top of SANs do provide file-level access, and are known as [[shared-disk file system]]s.

== Storage architectures==
[[File:Fibre Channel Storage Area Network.png|thumb|The Fibre Channel SAN connects servers to storage via Fibre Channel switches.]]

Storage area networks (SANs) are sometimes referred to as ''network behind the servers''&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{Cite web|title= Introduction to Storage Area Networks|authors =Jon Tate, Pall Beck, Hector Hugo Ibarra, Shanmuganathan Kumaravel &amp; Libor Miklas |publisher= Red Books, IBM|year=2017 |url=https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245470.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} and historically developed out of the [[centralised data storage]] model, but with its own [[data network]]. A SAN is, at its simplest, a dedicated network for data storage. In addition to storing data, SANs allow for the automatic [[backup]] of data, and the monitoring of the storage as well as the backup process.&lt;ref name="NIIT"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Special Edition: Using Storage Area Networks|authors =NIIT |publisher= Que Publishing|year=2002 |isbn=  9780789725745}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}} A SAN is a combination of hardware and software.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|9}} It grew out of data-centric [[Mainframe computer|mainframe architectures]], where clients in a network can connect to several [[server (computing)|server]]s that store different types of data.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|11}} To scale storage capacities as the volumes of data grew, [[direct attached storage]] (DAS) was developed, where [[disk arrays]] or [[just a bunch of disks]] (JBODs) were attached to  servers. In this architecture storage devices can be added to increase storage capacity. However, the server through which the storage devices are accessed is a [[single point of failure]], and a large part of the LAN network bandwidth is used for accessing, storing and backing up data. To solve the single point of failure issue, a ''direct attached shared storage'' architecture was implemented, where several servers could access the same storage device.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

DAS was the first network storage system and is still widely implemented where data storage requirements are not very high. Out of it developed the [[network attached storage]] (NAS) architecture, where one or more dedicated [[file server]] or storage devices are made available in a LAN.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Therefore, the transfer of data, particularly for backup, still takes place over the existing LAN. If more than a terabyte of data was stored at any one time, LAN bandwidth became a bottleneck.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|21–22}} Therefore, SANs were developed, where a dedicated storage network was attached to the LAN, and terabytes of data are transferred over a dedicated high speed and bandwidth network. Within the storage network, storage devices are interconnected. Transfer of data between storage devices, such as for backup, happens behind the servers and is meant to be transparent.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|22}} While in a NAS architecture data is transferred using the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] protocols over [[Ethernet]], distinct protocols were developed for SANs, such as [[Fibre Channel]], [[iSCSI]], [[InfiniBand|Infiniband]]. Therefore, SANs often have their own network and storage devices, which have to be bought, installed, and configured. This makes SANs inherently more expensive than NAS architectures.&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

== SAN components ==
[[File:QLogic QLE2562 8Gb FC HBA.jpg|thumb|200px|Dual port 8Gb FC host bus adapter card.]]
SANs have their own networking devices, such as SAN switches. To access the SAN so-called SAN servers are used, which in turn connect to SAN interfaces. Within the SAN a range of data storage devices may be interconnected, such as SAN capable disk arrays, JBODS and [[tape libraries]].&lt;ref name="NIIT"/&gt;{{rp|32,35–36}}

=== Host layer ===
Servers that allow access to the SAN and its storage devices are said to form the ''host layer'' of the SAN. Such servers have host bus adapters (HBAs), that are hardware cards that attach to slots on the server main board (usually PCI slots) and runs with a corresponding [[firmware]] and [[Device driver|driver.]]  Through the host bus adapters the [[operating system]] of the server can communicate with the storage devices in the SAN.&lt;ref name="Dummies"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Storage Area Networks For Dummies|editors =Christopher Poelker &amp; Alex Nikitin |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009 |isbn=9780470471340}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} A cable connects to the host bus adapter card through the gigabit interface converter (GBIC). These interface converters are also attached to switches and storage devices within the SAN, and they convert digital bits into light impulses that can then be transmitted over the fiber channel cables. Conversely, the GBIC converts incoming light impulses back into digital bits. The predecessor of the GBIC was called gigabit link module (GLM).&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|27}} This is applicable for fiber channel deployments only. 

=== Fabric layer ===
[[Image:ML-QLOGICNFCCONN.JPG|thumb| [[Qlogic]] SAN-[[Fibre Channel switch|switch]] with optical [[Fibre Channel]] [[Electrical connector|connectors]] installed.]]
The [[Fibre Channel switch|fabric]] layer consists of SAN networking devices that include SAN [[Fibre Channel switch|switches]], routers, protocol bridges, gateway devices, and cables. SAN network devices move data within the SAN, or between an ''initiator'', such as an HBA port of a server, and a ''target'', such as the port of a storage device. SAN networks are usually built with redundancy, so SAN switches are connected with redundant links. SAN switches connect the servers with the storage devices and are typically non-blocking, thus transmitting data across all attached wires at the same time.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|29}} When SANs were first built, hubs were the only devices that were [[fibre channel]] capable, but fibre channel switches were developed and hubs are now rarely found in SANs. Switches have the advantage over hubs that they allow all attached devices to communicate simultaneously, as a switch provides a dedicated link to connect all its ports with one another.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|34}} SAN switches are for redundancy purposes set up in a [[Mesh networking|meshed topology]]. A single SAN switch can have as few as 8 ports, up to 32 ports with modular extensions.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|35}} So called director class switches can have as many as 128 ports.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|36}} When SANs were first built fibre channel had to be implemented over copper cables, these days multimode [[Optical fiber|optical fibre cables]] are used in SANs.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|40}} In switched SANs the fibre channel switched fabric protocol FC-SW-6 is used, where every device in the SAN has a hardcoded [[World Wide Name]] (WWN) address in the host bus adapter (HBA). If a device is connected to the SAN its WWN is registered in the SAN switch name server.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|47}} In place of a WWN, or worldwide port name (WWPN), SAN fibre channel storage device vendors may also hardcode a worldwide node name (WWNN). The ports of storage devices often have an WWN starting with 5, while the bus adapters of servers start with 10 or 21.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|47}}

=== Storage layer ===
[[File:FC Layers-2.png|thumb|300px|Fibre Channel is a layered technology that starts at the physical layer and progresses through the protocols to the upper level protocols like SCSI and SBCCS.]]
On top of the Fibre Channel-Switched Protocol is often the serialized [[Small Computer Systems Interface]] (SCSI) protocol, implemented in servers and SAN storage devices. It allows software applications to communicate, or encode data, for storage devices. The [[iSCSI|internet Small Computer Systems Interface]] (iSCSI) over [[Ethernet]] and the [[Infiniband]] protocols may also be found implemented in SANs, but are often bridged into the fibre channel SAN.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|47}} However, Infiniband and iSCSI storage devices, in particular, disk arrays, are available.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|48}}

The various storage devices in a SAN are said to form the ''storage layer''. It can include a variety of [[hard disk]] and [[magnetic tape]] devices that store data. In SANs disk arrays are joined through a [[RAID]], which makes a lot of hard disks look and perform like one big storage device.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Every storage device, or even partition on that storage device, has a logical unit number (LUN) assigned to it. This is a unique number within the SAN and every node in the SAN, be it a server or another storage device, can access the storage through the LUN. The LUNs allow for the storage capacity of a SAN to be segmented and for the implementation of access controls. A particular server, or a group of servers, may, for example, be only given access to a particular part of the SAN storage layer, in the form of LUNs. When a storage device receives a request to read or write data, it will check its access list to establish whether the node, identified by its LUN, is allowed to access the storage area, also identified by a LUN.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|148–149}} LUN masking is a technique whereby the host bus adapter and the SAN software of a server restrict the LUNs for which commands are accepted. In doing so LUNs that should in any case not be accessed by the server are masked.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt;{{rp|354}} Another method to restrict server access to particular SAN storage devices is fabric-based access control, or zoning, which has to be implemented on the SAN networking devices and the servers. Thereby server access is restricted to storage devices that are in a particular SAN zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Storage Area Network Essentials: A Complete Guide to Understanding and Implementing SANs|authors =Richard Barker &amp; Paul Massiglia |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002 |isbn=9780471267119|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAN Network Protocols ==
Most storage networks use the [[SCSI]] protocol for communication between servers and disk drive devices. A mapping layer to other protocols is used to form a network:

* [[ATA over Ethernet|ATA over Ethernet (AoE)]], mapping of [[AT Attachment|ATA]] over [[Ethernet]]
* [[Fibre Channel Protocol]] (FCP), the most prominent one, is a mapping of SCSI over [[Fibre Channel]]
* [[Fibre Channel over Ethernet]] (FCoE)
* [[ESCON]] over Fibre Channel ([[FICON]]), used by [[mainframe computer]]s
* [[HyperSCSI]], mapping of SCSI over Ethernet
* [[iFCP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=IPstorage |title=TechEncyclopedia: IP Storage |accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[SANoIP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=SANoIP |title=TechEncyclopedia: SANoIP |accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; mapping of FCP over IP
* [[iSCSI]], mapping of SCSI over [[TCP/IP]]
* [[iSCSI Extensions for RDMA]] (iSER), mapping of iSCSI over [[InfiniBand]]
* [[SCSI RDMA Protocol]] (SRP), another SCSI implementation for RDMA transports

Storage networks may also be built using [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]] and [[Serial ATA|SATA]] technologies. SAS evolved from SCSI direct-attached storage. SATA evolved from [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] direct-attached storage. SAS and SATA devices can be networked using [[Serial attached SCSI#SAS expanders|SAS Expanders]].

== SAN software ==
A SAN is primarily defined as a special purpose network, the [[Storage Networking Industry Association]] (SNIA) defines a SAN as "a network whose primary purpose is the transfer of data between computer systems and storage elements". But a SAN does not just consist of a communication infrastructure, it also has a software ''management layer''. This software organizes the servers, storage devices, and the network so that data can be transferred and stored. Because a SAN is not a [[direct attached storage]] (DAS), the storage devices in the SAN are not owned and managed by a server.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|11}} Potentially the data storage capacity that can be accessed by a single server through a SAN is infinite, and this storage capacity may also be accessible by other servers.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|12}} Moreover, SAN software must ensure that data is directly moved between storage devices within the SAN, with minimal server intervention.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

SAN management software is installed on one or more servers and management clients on the storage devices. Two approaches have developed to SAN management software: in-band management means that management data between server and storage devices is transmitted on the same network as the storage data. While out-of-band management means that management data is transmitted over dedicated links.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|174}} SAN management software will collect management data from all storage devices in the storage layer, including info on read and write failure, storage capacity bottlenecks and failure of storage devices. SAN management software may integrate with the [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP).&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

In 1999 an open standard was introduced for managing storage devices and provide interoperability, the Common Information Model (CIM). The web-based version of CIM is called Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and defines SAN storage device objects and process transactions. Use of these protocols involves a CIM object manager (CIMOM), to manage objects and interactions, and allows for the central management of SAN storage devices. Basic device management for SANs can also be achieved through the Storage Management Interface Specification (SMI-S), were CIM objects and processes are registered in a directory. Software applications and subsystems can then draw on this directory.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|177}} Management software applications are also available to configure SAN storage devices, allowing, for example, the configuration of zones and logical unit numbers (LUNs).&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|178}}

Ultimately SAN networking and storage devices are available from many vendors. Every SAN vendor has its own management and configuration software. Common management in SANs that include devices from different vendors is only possible if vendors make the [[application programming interface]] (API) for their devices available to other vendors. In such cases, upper-level SAN management software can manage the SAN devices from other vendors.&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;{{rp|180}}

== SAN filesystems ==
In a SAN data is transferred, stored and accessed on a block level. As such a SAN does not provide [[data file]] abstraction, only [[block-level storage]] and operations. But [[file systems]] have been developed to work with SAN software to provide [[file-level access]]. These are known as SAN file systems, or shared disk file system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Data Management and Security: Applications in Medicine, Sciences, and Engineering|editors =A. Bia, A. Rabasa &amp; C. A. Brebbia |publisher= WIT Press|year=2013 |isbn=9781845647087|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Server operating systems maintain their own [[file system]]s on their own dedicated, non-shared LUNs, as though they were local to themselves. If multiple systems were simply to attempt to share a LUN, these would interfere with each other and quickly corrupt the data. Any planned sharing of data on different computers within a LUN requires software, such as [[SAN file system]]s or [[clustered computing]].

== In media and entertainment ==
[[Video editing]] systems require very high data transfer rates and very low latency.
SANs in media and entertainment are often referred to as serverless due to the nature of the configuration which places the video workflow (ingest, editing, playout) desktop clients directly on the SAN rather than attaching to servers. Control of data flow is managed by a distributed file system such as StorNext by Quantum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantum.com/products/software/stornext/index.aspx |title=StorNext Storage Manager - High-speed file sharing, Data Management, and Digital Archiving Software |publisher=Quantum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per-node bandwidth usage control, sometimes referred to as [[quality of service]] (QoS), is especially important in video editing as it ensures fair and prioritized bandwidth usage across the network.

==Quality of service==
SAN Storage QoS enables the desired storage performance to be calculated and maintained for network customers accessing the device.
Some factors that affect SAN QoS are:

*[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] – The rate of data throughput available on the system.
*[[Latency (engineering)|Latency]] – The time delay for a read/write operation to execute.
*Queue depth – The number of outstanding operations waiting to execute to the underlying disks (traditional or [[solid-state drive]]s).

QoS can be impacted in a SAN storage system by an unexpected increase in data traffic (usage spike) from one network user that can cause performance to decrease for other users on the same network. This can be known as the “noisy neighbor effect.” When QoS services are enabled in a SAN storage system, the “noisy neighbor effect” can be prevented and network storage performance can be accurately predicted.

Using SAN storage QoS is in contrast to using disk over-provisioning in a SAN environment. Over-provisioning can be used to provide additional capacity to compensate for peak network traffic loads. However, where network loads are not predictable, over-provisioning can eventually cause all bandwidth to be fully consumed and latency to increase significantly resulting in SAN performance degradation.

==Storage virtualization==
{{main|Storage virtualization}}
[[Storage virtualization]] is the process of abstracting logical storage from physical storage. The physical storage resources are aggregated into storage pools, from which the logical storage is created. It presents to the user a logical space for data storage and transparently handles the process of mapping it to the physical location, a concept called [[location transparency]]. This is implemented in modern disk arrays, often using vendor proprietary technology. However, the goal of storage virtualization is to group multiple disk arrays from different vendors, scattered over a network, into a single storage device.  The single storage device can then be managed uniformly. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[File:PlanetaSH(3).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Artist's impression of one possible appearance of a superhabitable planet. The reddish hue is vegetation.&lt;ref name="Plnts" /&gt;]]

A '''superhabitable planet''' is a hypothetical type of [[exoplanet]] or [[exomoon]] that may be better suited than [[Earth]] for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence]] and [[evolution]] of  [[life]]. The concept was introduced in 2014 by René Heller and John Armstrong,{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}} who have criticized the language used in the search for [[Planetary habitability|habitable planets]], so they propose clarifications because a [[circumstellar habitable zone]] (HZ) is not enough to define a planet's habitability.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=51|ps=}} Heller and  Armstrong state that it is not clear why Earth should offer the most suitable physicochemical parameters to living organisms, because "planets could be non-Earth-like, yet offer more suitable conditions for the emergence and evolution of life than Earth did or does."  While still assuming that life requires water, they hypothesize that Earth may not represent the optimal [[planetary habitability]] conditions for maximum [[biodiversity]]; in other words, they define a superhabitable world as a [[Rocky planet|terrestrial planet]] or moon that could support more diverse [[flora]] and [[fauna]] than there are on Earth, as it would empirically show that its [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] is more hospitable to life.

Heller and Armstrong also point out that not all [[rocky planet]]s in a [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] (HZ) may be habitable, and that [[tidal heating]] can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ, such as in [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s internal ocean.&lt;ref name="HZ"&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Reynolds, R.T. |author2=McKay, C.P. |author3=Kasting, J.F. |title=Europa, tidally heated oceans, and habitable zones around giant planets |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0273117787903644 |journal=Advances in Space Research |pages=125–132 |issue=7 |year=1987 | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(87)90364-4|bibcode = 1987AdSpR...7..125R }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The habitable zone (HZ) is a region present around each star where a terrestrial planet or moon that has an atmospheric pressure and a suitable combination of gases, could maintain liquid water on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mendez |first=Abel |date=10 August 2011 |title=Habitable Zone Distance (HZD): A habitability metric for exoplanets |journal=PHL |url=http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/habitablezonesdistancehzdahabitabilitymetricforexoplanets |access-date=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data|title=Planetary Habitability Laboratory |access-date=17 July 2015 |publisher=PHL de la [[University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo|UPRA]] |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, planets in the HZ may not be habitable, as tidal heating during the planet's orbit can be an additional heat source that causes a planet to enter a runaway greenhouse state.|group=n.}}  The authors propose that in order to identify a habitable—or superhabitable—planet, a characterization concept is required that is biocentric rather than geo- or [[anthropocentric]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}} Heller and Armstrong proposed to establish a profile for exoplanets according to stellar type, mass and location in their [[planetary system]], among other features. According to these authors, such superhabitable worlds would likely be larger, warmer, and older than Earth, and orbiting [[K-type main-sequence star]]s.

== General characteristics ==
Heller and Armstrong proposed that a series of basic characteristics are required to classify an [[exoplanet]] or [[exomoon]] as superhabitable;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/super-habitable-world-may-exist-near-earth/ |title=Super-Habitable World May Exist Near Earth |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=March 14, 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Williams, D.M. |author2=Kasting, J.F. |title=Habitable Planets with High Obliquities |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957596 |journal=Icarus |pages=254–267 |issue=1 | date=September 1997 |doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5759 |bibcode=1997Icar..129..254W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Rushby, A.J. |author2=Claire, M.W. |author3=Osborn, H. |author4=Watson, A.J. |title=Habitable Zone Lifetimes of Exoplanets around Main Sequence |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2012.0938 |journal=Astrobiology |pages=833–849 |issue=13 |date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} for size, it is required to be about 2 [[mass of the Earth|Earth masses]], and 1.3 [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] will provide an optimal size for [[plate tectonics]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55|ps=}} In addition, it would have a greater [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] that would increase retention of gases during the planet's formation.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} It is therefore likely that they have a denser [[atmosphere]] that will offer greater concentration of [[oxygen]] and [[greenhouse gas]]es, which in turn raise the average temperature to optimum levels for plant life to about {{convert|25|C|F}}.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}}&lt;ref name="ScAm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/superhabitable-planets/ |title=Faraway Planets May Be Far Better for Life |access-date=20 April 2015 |last=Moyer |first=Michael |date=31 January 2014 |journal=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt; A denser atmosphere may also influence the surface relief, making it more regular and decreasing the size of the [[ocean basin]]s, which would improve diversity of marine life in shallow waters.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-56|ps=}}

Other factors to consider are the [[Stellar classification|type of star]] in the system. [[K-type star]]s are less massive than the Sun, and are stable on the main sequence for a very long time (15 to 30 billion years, compared to 10 billion for the Sun, a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G-class star]]),{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56-57|ps=}} giving more time for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]] and [[evolution]]. A superhabitable world would also require to be located near the center of the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of its star system for a long time.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56|ps=}}{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}

An exoplanet with a larger volume than that of Earth, or with a more complex [[terrain]], or with a larger surface covered with liquid water, could be more hospitable for life than Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pierrehumbert| first=Raymond T.| title=Principles of Planetary Climate| url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/climatology-and-climate-change/principles-planetary-climate?format=HB| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521865562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the volume of a planet tends to be directly related to its mass, the more massive it is, the greater its gravitational pull, which can result in a denser atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/habitablezoneatmospherehzaahabitabilitymetricforexoplanets| title=Habitable Zone Atmosphere |access-date=16 July 2015 |first=[[PHL]] |work=PHL University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies indicate that there is a natural limit, set at 1.6R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;, below which nearly all planets are [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], composed primarily of rock-iron-water mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=How to make a planet just like Earth |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/space/2015/01/how-make-planet-just-earth| last=Clery |first=Daniel |journal=Science Magazine|date=5 January 2015| access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, objects with a mass below 6 [[Earth mass|M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;]] are very likely to be of similar composition as Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=New Instrument Reveals Recipe for Other Earths |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2015-03 |journal=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics| date=5 January 2015| access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above this limit, the density of the planets decreases with increasing size, the planet will become a [[Ocean planet|"water world"]] and finally a [[gas giant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=What Makes an Earth-Like Planet?

The average depth of the oceans also affects the habitability of a planet. The shallow areas of the sea, given the amount of light and heat they receive, usually are more comfortable for aquatic species, so it is likely that exoplanets with a lower average depth are more suitable for life.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=John S. |last=Gray |title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats, and conservation needs |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018335901847 |journal=Biodiversity &amp; Conservation |pages=153–175 |issue=6 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; More massive exoplanets would tend to have a regular surface gravity, which can mean shallower—and more hospitable—ocean basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Super-Earth Planets May Have Watery Earthlike Climates |url=http://www.space.com/24216-super-earth-exoplanets-earthlike-climate-aas223.html |last=Lewis |first=Tanya |journal=Space.com| date=9 January 2014| access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geology ===
[[Plate tectonics]], in combination with the presence of large bodies of water on a planet, is able to maintain high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|C|O|2}}) in its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=Douwe G. |last1=Van Der Meer |first2=Richard E. |last2=Zeebe |first3=Douwe J.

If the geological activity is not strong enough to generate a sufficient amount of greenhouse gases to increase global temperatures above the freezing point of water, the planet could experience a permanent [[ice age]], unless the process is offset by an intense internal heat source such as [[tidal heating]] or stellar irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Walker, J.C.G. |author2=Hays, P.B. |author3=Kasting, J.F. |title=A negative feedback mechanism for the long-term stabilization of the earth's surface temperature |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JC086iC10p09776/abstract;jsessionid=7C2466400356F88A3A66F1D12E0F083B.f03t01 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |pages=9776–9782 |issue=86 |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosphere===
Another feature favorable to life is a planet's potential to develop a strong  [[magnetosphere]] to protect its surface and atmosphere from [[cosmic radiation]] and [[Solar wind|stellar winds]], especially around [[Habitability of red dwarf systems|red dwarf stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Baumstark-Khan, C. |author2=Facius, R. |title=Life under conditions of ionizing radiation |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JC086iC10p09776/abstract;jsessionid=7C2466400356F88A3A66F1D12E0F083B.f03t01 |journal=Astrobiology |pages=261–284 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less massive bodies and those with a slow rotation, or those that are [[tidal locking|tidally locked]], have a weak or no magnetic field, which over time can result in the loss of a significant portion of its atmosphere, especially [[hydrogen]], by [[hydrodynamic escape]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55|ps=}}
[[File:Mangrove-1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|The climate of a warmer and wetter terrestrial exoplanet may resemble that of the [[Tropics|tropical]] regions of Earth. In the picture, [[mangrove]] in [[Cambodia]].]]

=== Temperature and climate ===
The optimum temperature for Earth-like life in general is unknown, although it appears that on Earth organism diversity has been greater in warmer periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Mayhew, P.J. |author2=Bell, M.A. |author3=Benton, T.G. |author4=McGowan, A.J. |title=Biodiversity tracks temperature over time |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/38/15141 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=15141–15145 |issue=38 |volume=109 |year=2012|bibcode = 2012PNAS..10915141M |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1200844109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible that exoplanets with slightly higher average temperatures than that of Earth are more suitable for life.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-56|ps=}} The thermoregulatory effect of large oceans on exoplanets located in a habitable zone may maintain a moderate temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ian |last=O'Neill |title=Oceans Make Exoplanets Stable for Alien Life |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/oceans-make-exoplanets-stable-for-alien-life-140721.htm |journal=Discovery News |date=21 July 2014 |access-date=21 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-56|ps=}} In this case, deserts would be more limited in area and would likely support habitat-rich coastal environments.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-56|ps=}}

On the opposite side, the less massive [[Red dwarf|M]] and [[K-type star|K]] types  are by far the most common and long-lived stars of the universe, but their potential for supporting life is still under study.&lt;ref name="RDrf" /&gt;{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=285|ps=}} Their low luminosity reduces the size of the [[habitable zone]], which are exposed to ultraviolet radiation outbreaks that occur frequently, especially during their first billion year of existence.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}} When a planet's orbit is too short, it can cause [[tidal locking]] of the planet, where it always presents the same hemisphere  to the star, known as ''day hemisphere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Nola T. |last=Redd |title=Tidal Locking Could Render Habitable Planets Inhospitable |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/tidal-locking-could-render-habitable-planets-inhospitable/ |journal=Astrobiology  |date=8 December 2011 |access-date=21 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=285|ps=}} Even if the existence of life were possible in a system of this type, it is unlikely that any exoplanet belonging to a [[red dwarf]] star would be considered superhabitable.&lt;ref name="RDrf" /&gt;

Dismissing both ends, systems with a [[K-type star]]s offer the best habitable zones for life.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=285|ps=}} K-type stars allow the formation of planets around them, have a long life expectancy, and  provide a stable habitable zone free of the effects of excessive proximity to its star.{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=285|ps=}} Furthermore, the radiation produced by a K-type star is high enough to allow complex life without the need for an atmospheric [[ozone layer]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cockell, C.S. |title=Carbon Biochemistry and the Ultraviolet Radiation Environments of F, G, and K Main Sequence Stars |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103599961675 |journal=Icarus |pages=399–407 |issue=2 |volume=141 | date=October 1999 |doi=10.1006/icar.1999.6167 |bibcode=1999Icar..141..399C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rushby, A.J. |author2=Claire, M.W. |author3=Osborn, H. |author4=Watson, A.J. |title=Habitable Zone Lifetimes of Exoplanets around Main Sequence |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/765/2/131/ |journal=Astrobiology |pages=833–849 |issue=9 |volume=13 |year=2013|bibcode = 2013AsBio..13..833R |doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also the most stable and their habitable zone does not move very much during its lifetime, so a terrestrial analog located near a K-type star may be habitable for almost all of the main sequence.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}

=== Orbit and rotation ===
[[File:Kepler186f-ArtistConcept-20140417.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Artistic impression of a possible [[Earth analog]], [[Kepler-186f]]. Some superhabitable planets could have a similar appearance and may not have important differences with Earth.]]

Experts have not reached a consensus about what is the optimal rotation speed for an exoplanet, but it should not be too fast nor too slow. The latter case can cause some problems similar to those observed in Venus, which completes one rotation every 243 Earth days and as a result, cannot generate an Earth-like [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |title=Planet Venus Facts: A Hot, Hellish &amp; Volcanic Planet |url=http://www.space.com/44-venus-second-planet-from-the-sun-brightest-planet-in-solar-system.html |journal=Space.com |date=4 November 2014 |access-date=2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57-58|ps=}}

Ideally, the orbit of a superhabitable world must be at the midpoint of the habitable zone of its [[star system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23910-habitable-zones-alien-planets-stars-infographic.html |title=How Habitable Zones for Alien Planets and Stars Work |access-date=20 April 2015 |last=Tate |first=Karl |date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}}

=== Atmosphere ===
There are no solid arguments to explain if Earth's atmosphere has the optimal composition to host life.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} On Earth, during the period when [[coal]] was first formed, atmospheric oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) levels were up to 35%, and  coincided with the periods of greatest [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Falcon-Lang, H. J.| title=Fire ecology of a Late Carboniferous floodplain, Joggins, Nova Scotia| year=1999| publisher=Journal of the Geological Society| location=London| chapter=156| pages=137–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, assuming that the presence of a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is essential for exoplanets to develop complex life forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Harrison, J.F. |author2=Kaiser, A. |author3=VandenBrooks, J.M. |title=Atmospheric oxygen level and the evolution of insect body size |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1690/1937 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |pages=1937–1946 |volume=277 |date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} the percentage of oxygen relative to the total atmosphere appears to limit the maximum size of the planet for optimum superhabitability and ample biodiversity{{Clarify|date=October 2016}}.

Also, the atmospheric density should be higher in more massive planets, which reinforces the hypothesis that [[super-Earths]] can provide superhabitable conditions.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}}

=== Age ===
[[File:Artist’s Impression of a Baby Star Still Surrounded by a Protoplanetary Disc.jpg|280px|thumb|right|The first stars that formed in the universe were [[metallicity|metal-free stars]], which probably prevented planet formation.]]
In a biological context, older planets than Earth may have greater biodiversity, since native species have had more time to [[Biological evolution|evolve]], adapt and stabilize the environmental conditions to sustain a suitable environment for life that can benefit their descendants.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56-57|ps=}}

However, for many years it was thought that since older star systems have lower [[metallicity]], they should display low planet formation, and thus such old planets may have been scant in the beginning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ray |last=Sanders |title=When Stellar Metallicity Sparks Planet Formation |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/when-stellar-metallicity-sparks-planet-formation/ |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |date=9 April 2012 |access-date=7 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the number of ''[[Metallicity|metallic]]'' items in the universe must have grown steadily since its inception.&lt;ref name="AgP"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/17441-universe-heavy-metals-planet-formation.html |title=When Did the Universe Have the Right Stuff for Planets? |access-date=24 April 2015 |journal=Space.com |last=Cooper |first=Keith |date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first exoplanetary discoveries, mostly gas giants orbiting very close to their stars, known as ''[[Hot Jupiters]]'', suggest that planets were rare in systems with low metallicity, which invited suspicion of a time limit on the appearance of the first objects landmass.{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=188-189|ps=}} Later, in 2012, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler telescope]]'s observations allowed experts to find out that this relationship is much more restrictive in systems with [[Hot Jupiters]], and that terrestrial planets could form in stars of much lower metallicity, to some extent.&lt;ref name="AgP" /&gt;  It is now thought that the first Earth-mass objects should appear sometime between 7 and 12 billion years.&lt;ref name="AgP" /&gt; Given the greater stability of the orange dwarfs (K-type) compared to the Sun (G-type) and longer life expectancy, it is possible that superhabitable exoplanets belonging to K-type stars, orbiting within its habitable zone, could provide a longer, steadier, and better environment for life than Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}

== Profile summary ==
[[File:Kepler442b(comp).jpg|240px|thumb|right|A size comparison and artist's impression of Kepler-442b (1.34 R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;) to the [[Earth]] (right).]]
Despite the scarcity of information available, the hypotheses presented above on superhabitable planets can be summarized as a preliminary profile, even if there is no scientific consensus.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} 
* Mass: approximately 2M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Radius: to maintain a similar Earth density, its radius should be between 1.2 and 1.3R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Oceans: percentage of surface area covered by oceans should be Earth-like but more distributed, without large continuous land masses. The oceans should be shallow; the light then will penetrate easier through the water and will reach the fauna and flora, stimulating an abundance of life down in the ocean.
* Distance: shorter distance from the center of the habitable zone of the system than Earth.
* Temperature: average surface temperature of about {{convert|25|C|F}}.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}} 
* Star and age: belonging to an intermediate [[K-type star]] with an older age than the Sun (4.5 billion years) but younger than 7 billion years.
* Atmosphere: somewhat denser than Earth's and with a higher concentration of oxygen. That will make life larger and more abundant.

There is no confirmed exoplanet that meets all these requirements. After updating the database of exoplanets on 23 July 2015, the one that comes closest is [[Kepler-442b]], belonging to an orange dwarf star, with a radius of 1.34R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; and a mass of 2.34M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;, but with an estimated surface temperature of {{convert|-2.65|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=Kepler-442+b| title=NASA Exoplanet Archive |access-date=8 January 2015 |first=[[NASA]] |work=NASA Exoplanet Science Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data|title=Planetary Habitability Laboratory |access-date=7 January 2015 |first=[[PHL]] |work=PHL University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance ===

The appearance of a superhabitable planet should be, in general, very similar to Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}} The main differences, in compliance with the profile seen previously, would be derived from its mass. Its denser atmosphere probably prevent the formation of ice sheets as a result of lower thermal difference between different regions of the planet.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Also, it has a higher concentration of clouds, and abundant rainfall.

Probably the vegetation is very different due to the increased air density, precipitation, temperature, and stellar flux. For the type of light emitted from the [[K-type star]]s, plants may take other colors than green.&lt;ref name="Plnts"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| author=Nancy Y. Kiang| date=April 2008| title=The color of plants on other worlds| url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-color-of-plants-on-other-worlds| access-date=2 March 2015| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0408-48| volume=298| pages=48–55|bibcode = 2008SciAm.298d..48K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/3680-colorful-worlds-plants-planets-green.html |title=Colorful Worlds: Plants on Other Planets Might Not Be Green |access-date=2 March 2015 |last=Than |first=Ker |date=11 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation  would cover more regions than vegetation here on Earth, making this visible from space.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}

In general, the climate of a superhabitable planet would be warmer, moist, homogeneous and have stable land, allowing life to extend across the surface without presenting large population differences, in contrast to Earth that has inhospitable areas such as glaciers, deserts and tropical regions.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-56|ps=}} If the atmosphere contains enough molecular oxygen, the conditions of these planets may be bearable to humans even without the protection of a [[space suit]], provided that the atmosphere does not contain excessive toxic gases, but would require some adaptation to the increased gravity, such as an increase in muscles and  in bone density, etc.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}&lt;ref name="WW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/20728-new-alien-planets-oceans-life.html |title=What Might Alien Life Look Like on New 'Water World' Planets? |access-date=23 April 2015 |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=18 April 2013 |publisher=Space.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abundance ==
[[File:SH Planet comp.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Set and subsets of terrestrial worlds.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}}]]
Heller and Armstrong speculate that the number of superhabitable planets can far exceed that of [[Earth analog]]s:{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}} less massive stars in the [[main sequence]] are more abundant than the larger and brighter stars, so there are more orange dwarfs than solar analogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=LeDrew |first=Glenn |year=2001 |title=The Real Starry Sky |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |volume=95 |issue=686 |pages=32–33 |issn=0035-872X |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2001JRASC..95...32L&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=16 July 2015 |bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that about 9% of stars in the Milky Way are [[K-type star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Croswell |first=Ken |title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60sPD6yjbVAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=percentage+%22orange+dwarfs%22+milky+way&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zit9UpfGA-&amp;sig=o1ASitJqAFJH7NqnlVOyRS-DLsU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI0_Ki-cjgxgIVxVoUCh3AYACT#v=onepage&amp;q=percentage%20%22orange%20dwarfs%22%20milky%20way&amp;f=false |access-date=17 July 2015 |edition=1 |year=1997 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0684832526 |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point favoring the predominance of superhabitable planets in regard to Earth analogs is that, unlike the latter, most of the requirements of a superhabitable world can occur spontaneously and jointly simply by having a higher mass.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-58|ps=}} A planetary body close to 2 or 3M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; should have longer-lasting plate tectonics and also will have a larger surface area in comparison to Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} Similarly, it is likely that its oceans are shallower by the effect of gravity on the planet's crust, its gravitational field more intense and, a denser atmosphere.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}}

By contrast, Earth-mass planets may have a wider range of conditions. For example, some may sustain active tectonics for a shorter time period and will therefore end up with lower air density than Earth, increasing the probability of developing global ice coverage, or even a permanent [[Snowball Earth]] scenario.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Another negative effect of lower atmospheric density can be manifested in the form of thermal oscillations, which can lead to high variability in the global climate and increase the chance for  catastrophic events. In addition, by having a weaker [[magnetosphere]], such planets may lose their atmospheric hydrogen by [[hydrodynamic escape]] easier and become a desert planet.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Any of these examples could prevent the emergence of life on a planet's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star/#.VMlrZi4XeOU |title=NASA's Kepler Discovers First Earth-Size Planet In The 'Habitable Zone' of Another Star |access-date=4 August 2015 |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |date=17 April 2014 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the multitude of scenarios that can turn an Earth-mass planet located in the habitable zone of a solar analogue into an inhospitable place are less likely on a planet that meets the basic features of a superhabitable world, so that the latter should be more common.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}}

[[Image:Apoplast and symplast pathways.svg|thumb|300px|The apoplastic and symplastic pathways]]
The '''symplast''' of a [[plant]] is the inner side of the [[plasma membrane]] in which water and low-molecular-weight [[Solution|solutes]] can freely [[diffusion|diffuse]]. Symplast cells have more than one nucleus. 

The [[plasmodesmata]] allow the direct flow of small molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and ions between cells. Larger molecules, including [[transcription factor]]s and [[plant virus]]es, can also be transported through with the help of [[actin]] structures.

This allows direct [[cytoplasm]]-to-cytoplasm flow of water and other nutrients along concentration gradients. In particular, symplastic flow is used in the root systems to bring in nutrients from soil. It moves these solutes from [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] cells through the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] into the [[endodermis]]. Once solutes reach the endodermal cells thorough [[Apoplast|apoplastic flow]], they are forced into the symplastic pathway due to the presence of the [[Casparian strip]]. Once the solutes are passively filtered, they eventually reach the [[pericycle]], where it can be moved into the [[xylem]] for long distance transport.
It is contrasted with the apoplastic flow, which uses cell wall transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Science|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|year=2014|isbn=9780321743671|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The symplastic transport was first realized by Eduard Tangl in 1879, who also discovered the [[plasmodesmata]], a term coined by [[Eduard Strasburger]], 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Tangl, E. (1879). Ueber offene Communicationen zwischen den Zellen des Endosperms einiger Samen. ''Jahrbüecherfüer Wissenschaftliche Botanik'' 12: 170–190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger, E. (1901). Über plasmaverbindungen pflanzlicher zellen. ''Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik'' 36: 493–610.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[Johannes von Hanstein|Hanstein]] coined the term symplast.&lt;ref&gt;Hanstein, J. 1880. ''[https://archive.org/details/DasProtoplasma Das Protoplasma]''. Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; The contrasting terms apoplast and symplast were used together in 1930 by [[Ernst Münch|Münch]].&lt;ref&gt;Münch, E (1930). ''Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze''. Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, W. F. (2003). The role of cytoplasmic streaming in symplastic transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">In [[political science]], international and comparative [[law]] and [[economics]], '''transitology''' is the name for the study of the process of change from one political [[regime]] to another, mainly from [[authoritarian]] regimes to [[democracy|democratic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Transitology tries to explain processes of [[democratization]] in a variety of contexts, from bureaucratic authoritarianism and other forms of dictatorship in [[Latin America]], [[southern Europe]] and [[northern Africa]] to [[postcommunist]] developments in [[eastern Europe]]. The debate has become something of an academic "turf-war" between [[Comparative politics|comparative studies]] and [[area studies]] scholars, while highlighting several problematic features of [[social science]] [[methodology]], including [[generalization]], an overemphasis on [[elite]] attitudes and behavior, [[Eurocentrism]], the role of [[history]] in explaining [[causality]], and the inability to produce testable [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2501122]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transport finance''' is the subject that explores how [[transport]] networks are paid for.    

The timing of the money required to finance transport is a principal issue.  Many projects are "[[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]]", that is infrastructure, which lasts many years, is expected to be paid out of ongoing cash flow.  Other projects are financed with [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] raised in [[capital market]]s. Bonds must be secured with an expected future cash flow.  

The cash flow, required for either pay-as-you-go or for bonds, must be raised.  Common sources are [[user fee]]s, such as [[gas tax]]es, and [[Toll road|toll]]s.  Other sources are [[revenue|general revenue]].  This issue is related to who bears the burden: users or the general public.  Even if users bear the burden, that class must be subdivided, e.g. users during peak times or off-peak, freight or passenger traffic, urban or rural users, residents or non-residents (many toll plazas are located on the state line to maximize revenue from non-residents).

A third issue concerns the [[full cost]]s of transportation.  There are monetary costs, which are financed with money, as considered above, but there are also non-monetary costs (sometimes called [[hidden cost]]s), which are paid for by people's time, by clean air, by peace and quiet, etc.  See the discussion of [[externalities]] for a fuller explication of non-monetary costs.

'''''Walden Two''''' is a [[utopian novel]] written by [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral]] psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]], first published in 1948.  In its time, it could have been considered [[science fiction]], since science-based methods for altering people's behavior did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1986). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1348231/pdf/jeabehav00047-0109.pdf "Some Thoughts About the Future"]. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', '''45'''(2), p. 229. "What the protagonist in ''Walden Two'' called a behavioral technology was at the time still science fiction, but it soon moved into the real world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). ''Walden Two.'' Indianapolis: [[Hackett Publishing Company]]. Revised 1976 edition, page vi. {{ISBN|0-87220-779-X}}. "The 'behavioral engineering' I had so frequently mentioned in the book was, at the time, little more than science fiction".&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods  are now known as [[applied behavior analysis]].

''Walden Two'' is controversial because its characters speak of a rejection of [[free will]],&lt;ref&gt;Aschner, Mary Jane McCue (1965). "The Planned Man: Skinner". ''The Educated Man: Studies in the History of Educational Thought.'' Paul Nash, Andreas M. Kazamias, and Henry J. Perkinson (Editors). [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], pp. 389–421. "Public reaction to ''Walden Two'', with its proposal for planned man, was initially slow. But eventually Skinner found himself at the storm center of a controversy that has scarcely abated to this day.  Philosophers and psychologists charged into the latest jousting match in the perennial tourney between proponents of determinism and defenders of free will". p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; including a rejection of the proposition that human behavior is controlled by a non-corporeal entity, such as a [[spirit]] or a [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivie, Stanley D.

==Synopsis==
The [[first-person narrator]] and [[protagonist]], Professor Burris, is a university instructor of psychology, who is approached by two young men (one a former student) sometime in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of [[World War II]] and, intrigued by [[utopian]]ism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s started an [[intentional community]] that still thrives. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their girlfriends and Burris brings along a colleague named Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.

The rest of the book proceeds largely as a [[novel of ideas]], mostly involving Frazier, a smug, talkative, and colorful character, guiding his new visitors around Walden Two and proudly explaining its socio-politico-economic structures and collectivist achievements. A wide range of intellectual topics such as [[behavioral modification]], [[political ethics]], [[educational philosophy]], [[sexual equality]] (specifically, advocacy for [[women in the workforce]]), the [[common good]], [[historiography]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[free will]], the [[problem of free will|dilemma of determinism]], [[fascism]], [[American democracy]], and [[Soviet communism]] are discussed and often debated among the self-satisfied Frazier, the skeptical and doubting Castle, and the quietly intrigued Burris.

In effect, Walden Two operates using a flexible design, by continually testing the most successful, evidence-based strategies in order to organize the community. Frazier argues that Walden Two thus avoids the way that most societies collapse or grow dysfunctional: by remaining dogmatically rigid in their politics and social structure. He verifies Walden Two's success by pointing to its members' overall sense of happiness and freedom&amp;mdash;thanks in part to a program of "[[behavioral engineering]]" begun at birth. Despite these behavior-guiding procedures during childhood, the adults of Walden Two indeed appear to be legitimately peaceful, productive, and happy people; they also appear to govern the course of their own lives.

Frazier delightedly explains that Walden Two's decision-making system is not authoritarian, anarchic, or even democratic. Except for a small fluctuating group of community organizers, called Planners (temporarily including Frazier), Walden Two has no real governing body; certainly, the Planners have no power to exercise violent force on the community, a feature that Frazier often praises. Each member of the community is apparently self-motivated, with an amazingly relaxed work schedule of only four average hours of work a day, directly supporting the common good and accompanied by the freedom to select a fresh new place to work each day. The members then use the large remainder of their  time to engage in creative or recreational activities of their own choosing. The only money is a simple system of points that buys greater leisure periods in exchange for less desirable labor. Members automatically receive ample food and sleep, with higher needs met by nurturing one's artistic, intellectual, and athletic interests, ranging from music to literature and from chess to tennis. 

As Burris and the other visitors tour the grounds, they discover that certain radically unusual customs have been established in Walden Two, quite bizarre to the American mainstream, but showing apparent success in the long run. Some of these customs include that children are raised communally, families are non-nuclear, free affection is the norm, and personal expressions of thanks are taboo. Such behavior is mandated by the community's individually self-enforced "Walden Code", a guideline for self-control techniques, which encourages members to credit all individual and other achievements to the larger community, while requiring minimal strain. [[Community counselors]] are also available to supervise behavior and assist members with better understanding and following the Code.

Excitedly, two of the young visitors sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered a growing hunch that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of democracy, Castle finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of [[despotism]], though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the "despotism of democracy". 

At some points, Frazier and Burris have pleasant talks in private, with Frazier revealing that other communities loosely associated with Walden Two have now cropped up, the most recent being Walden Six. Although enticed by Walden Two's obvious success as a peaceful community, Burris finds it difficult to look past Frazier's irritating pride and boastfulness about the community. During one conversation, Frazier admits to being boastful, but argues that his personality should not influence Burris's opinion of Walden Two and his own observations. By the end of their stay, the remaining visitors leave the community in a mostly impressed state of wonder, except for Castle, who has stubbornly settled on the idea that, somehow, Frazier is a scoundrel and the community is fraudulent. 

During the visitors' trip back to the university, Burris ultimately decides in an inspired moment that he wishes to fully embrace the Walden Two lifestyle. Quickly abandoning his professorial post, Burris travels back in a long and spiritually satisfying journey on foot; he is welcomed once again to Walden Two with open arms.

==The community==
The novel describes "an experimental community called Walden Two".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), pp. 5–14. "My name is Burris. I live in an experimental community called Walden Two". p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altus"&gt;Altus, Deborah E., and Morris, Edward K. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778813/pdf/bhan-32-02-319.pdf "B. F. Skinner's Utopian Vision: Behind and Beyond ''Walden Two''"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''32'''(2), pp. 319–335. B. F. Skinner regarded ''Walden Two'' as his "book about an experimental community". p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The community is located in a rural area and "has nearly a thousand members".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The community encourages its members "to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement" and to have "a constantly experimental attitude toward everything".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of Walden Two can be changed if experimental evidence favors proposed changes. The community emulates (on a communal scale) the [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] that [[Henry David Thoreau]] practiced (on an individual scale) at [[Walden Pond]], as described in his 1854 book ''[[Walden]]''. Walden Two engages in behavioral engineering of young children that aims toward cooperative relationships and the erasure of competitive sentiments. The community has also dissolved the [[nuclear family]] through placing the responsibility of child-rearing in the hands of the larger community and not just the child's parents or immediate family.

==Community governance==
Walden Two consists of four loose classes or groupings of people by occupation (though they are not akin to strict [[economic class]]es): ''Planners'', ''Managers'', ''Workers'', and ''Scientists''. Walden&amp;nbsp;Two has a constitution that provides for a “''Board of Planners''”, which is Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s “only government”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; though the power they wield only amounts to that, approximately, of community organizers. The “Board of Planners” was conceived of while Walden&amp;nbsp;Two was still in its earliest theoretical stages, and there are “six Planners, usually three men and three women”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; who are “charged with the success of the community. They make policies, review the work of the Managers (heads of each area of labor), keep an eye on the state of the nation in general. They also have certain judicial functions.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A Planner “may serve for ten years, but no longer.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A vacancy on the Board of Planners is filled by the Board "from a pair of names supplied by the Managers".&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; Furthermore, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two constitution “can be changed by a unanimous vote of the Planners and a two-thirds vote of the Managers”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazier and five other people constitute the current Board of Planners during Burris’s visit to Walden&amp;nbsp;Two. Planners hold office in staggered, limited terms. They do not rule with any kind of force and are so extremely opposed to creating a [[cult of personality]], system of favoritism, or other possibilities for corruption going against the common good that they do not even publicly announce their office, and, likewise, most of the community members do not bother to know the Planners' identities. Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as the other members of the community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s [[egalitarian]] cultural structure.

Managers, meanwhile, are “specialists in charge of the divisions and services of Walden&amp;nbsp;Two”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A member of the community can “work up to be a Manager – through intermediate positions which carry a good deal of responsibility and provide the necessary apprenticeship”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"&gt;''Walden Two'', p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Managers are not elected by the members of Walden Two in any kind of democratic process.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"/&gt; The method of selecting Managers is not specified, though they are likely appointed by the Board of Planners.

The regular community members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, and they have the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average daily hours of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden&amp;nbsp;Two operates using a simple point system of units called “credits”, in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.

The final grouping within Walden&amp;nbsp;Two is the Scientists, who conduct experiments “in plant and animal breeding, the control of infant behavior, educational processes of several sorts, and the use of some of [Walden Two’s] raw materials”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are the least discussed group in the novel; little is said about the selection, total number, specific duties, or methods of the Scientists, though they presumably carry out the ongoing social experiments that help determine the most beneficial social strategies for the community.

==Thoreau's ''Walden''==
''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'''s title is a direct reference to [[Henry David Thoreau]]’s book ''[[Walden]]''. In the novel, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau’s Walden, but “with company”. It is, as the book says, ‘Walden for two’ – meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, rather than in a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it ''The Sun is but a Morning Star'', a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau’s ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=morningstar&gt;{{cite book |author=Thoreau, Henry David |year=1854 |url=https://archive.org/details/waldenorlifeinwo1854thor |title=Walden; or, Life in the woods |location=Boston, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Ticknor and Fields]] |quote=The sun is but a morning star. |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.

In theory and in practice, Thoreau’s Walden Pond experiment and the fictive Walden&amp;nbsp;Two experiment were far different from one another: For instance, Thoreau’s book ''Walden'' espouses the virtues of self-reliance at the individual level, while ''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'' espouses
# the virtues of self-reliance at the community level, and
# Skinner’s underlying premise that free will of the individual is weak&lt;br/&gt;compared to how environmental conditions [[Shaping (psychology)|shape]] behavior.

The cover of ''Walden Two'', shown above, includes an ‘O’ filled with yellow ink, with yellow lines radiating from the center of the ‘O’. That Sun-like ‘O’ is an allusion to the proposition that ''The sun is but a morning star''.&lt;ref name=morningstar/&gt;

==''News From Nowhere, 1984''==
Skinner published a follow-up to ''Walden Two'' in an essay titled ''News From Nowhere, 1984''. It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as [[George Orwell]]. Blair seeks out Frazier as the 'leader' and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Blair was impressed by Walden Two's "lack of any institutionalized government, religion, or economic system", a state of affairs that embodied "the dream of nineteenth-century [[anarchism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world efforts==

Twin Oaks is detailed in [[Kat Kinkade]]'s book, ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkade, Kathleen (1973). ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''. [[William Morrow and Company]]. {{ISBN|0-688-00020-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.

Los Horcones does not use the Planner-Manager governance system described in ''Walden Two.''  They refer to their governance system as a "personocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Los Horcones (February 25, 2012). [http://directory.ic.org/715/Comunidad_Los_Horcones "Communities Directory"]. [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]], Retrieved August 23, 2012. "We value the participation of all members in decision making. We call our organization 'personocracy'".&lt;/ref&gt; This system has been "developed through ongoing experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti, Angela (2012).

''Behavior and Social Issues,'' 21, pp. 5-25. "The ''Walden Two''-inspired community of Los Horcones in Sonora, Mexico, proclaims an egalitarian system of governance developed through ongoing experimentation, called 'Personocracy' (Los Horcones), which they describe as equitable and unrestricted access to power, participation, and responsibility." p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Twin Oaks, Los Horcones "has remained strongly committed to an [[Experimental analysis of behavior|experimental science of human behavior]] and has described itself as the only true Walden Two community in existence."&lt;ref&gt;Lamal, Peter (2009).

Paperback edition: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] (March 1, 1965). {{ISBN|0029290406}}, {{ISBN|978-0029290408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a chapter is titled "Designing a Culture" and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' there are many indirect references to ''Walden Two'' when describing other cultural designs.

==Criticisms==
Hilke Kuhlmann's ''Living Walden Two'' possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original ''Walden Two'' which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.

In a critique of ''Walden Two,'' Harvey L. Gamble, Jr. asserted that Skinner's "fundamental thesis is that individual traits are shaped from above, by social forces that create the environment", and that Skinner's goal "is to create a frictionless society where individuals are properly socialized to function with others as a unit", and to thus "make the community [Walden Two] into a perfectly efficient [[anthill]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harvey L., Jr., (1999). [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-54552225/walden-two-postmodern-utopia.html "''Walden Two,'' Postmodern Utopia, and the Problems of Power, Choice, and the Rule of Law".] ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language,'' 41(1), p. 3. Retrieved September 19, 2009 from accessmylibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Gamble writes, "We find at the end of ''Walden Two'' that Frazier [a founding member of Walden Two]... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda." However, contrary to Gamble's critique, it should be noted that neither Frazier nor any other person has the ''sole'' power to amend the constitution of Walden Two.  See the "Community governance" section, above.

There are several varieties of behaviorism but only Skinner’s radical behaviorism, has proposed to redesign society. The relevant principles were expounded at length two decades later in a best-seller ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971).

''Walden Two'' was criticized in John Staddon's ''The New Behaviorism''.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014)  ''The New Behaviorism'' (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner thought ''Walden Two'' an accomplishment comparable to two science-fiction classics: [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1931) and [[George Orwell]]’s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).  He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory psychology course at Harvard.  There is some irony in Skinner’s choice, because Orwell’s and Huxley’s novels are both dystopias.  They portray not the supposed benefits of a technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (''Nineteen Eighty-Four'') or stealthy (''Brave New World'') efforts to control or gentle human beings.  On the contrary, ''Walden Two'' is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.

Skinner’s Walden proposal is in a tradition that goes back to Plato’s philosopher king: a ‘legislator’ (monarch) and a set of guardians who are wiser than the common people.  The guardians “are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870 and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day,” wrote [[Bertrand Russell]], one of Skinner’s heroes, in 1946.   Not too different from Walden Two’s Managers and Planners, and Frazier, Skinner’s avatar and leader of the community.  Skinner was quite explicit about the need for technocratic rule: “We must delegate control of the population as a whole to specialists – to police, priests, teachers, therapies, and so on, with their specialized reinforcers and their codified contingencies.”&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond freedom and dignity'', 1971, August Psychology Today 37-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wardak Vase''' is the name of an ancient globular-shaped buddhist [[copper]] vase that was found as part of a [[stupa]] [[relic]] deposit in the  early nineteenth century near [[Chaki Wardak]] in [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. The importance of the vase lies in the long [[Kharoshthi]] inscription, which claims that the stupa contained the relics of the [[Buddha]]. Since 1880, the vase has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s [[The British Museum Department of Asia|Asian collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=105550&amp;plaA=105550-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/b/bronze_reliquary_and_kushan_co.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The vase, coins and other relics were found by the [[United Kingdom|British]] adventurer and spy [[Charles Masson]] in 1836. Mason unearthed the vase in one of the stupas near the town of Wardak.  The finds were sent to London in 1839, where they became part of the Indian Museum's collection. In 1880, they were transferred to the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
The Wardak Vase is [[spherical]] in shape and made of copper alloy. The vase has a slim neck with an inverted rim and a low flat base. It has a series of three parallel [[Grooves (archaeology)|grooves]] running around the middle of the vase (with a further two pairs of grooves above and below). Engraved between the upper and middle grooves are four lines of Kharoshthi script that dates the vase and deposit to the year 178 AD. With the vase were found a number of beads and sixty-six coins of the [[Kushan]] Kings [[Vima Kadphises]], [[Kanishka I]] and [[Huvishka]].

==Inscription==
The long inscription refers to the Kushan year 51 in the reign of Kanishka I who reigned between AD 110 and 120, but also refers to one of his successors Huvishka, who ruled between AD 146 and 83; it thus provides useful evidence for reconstructing the chronological reigns of Kushan [[Royal family|royalty]] at the time. The inscription also indicates that the [[monastery]] was built by the [[Mahasanghikas]], one of the earliest buddhist schools in India, who were based at [[Mathura]], near Delhi. The vase therefore provides strong evidence for the widespread distribution of Buddhism in [[South Asia]] almost 2000 years ago.

==Translation of the Inscription==
A translation of the inscription is described below:

"In the 51st year, in the month Artemisios, after 15 (days), at this time Vag̱amareg̱a, son of Kamagulya; he has made his abode here in Khavada (and) establishes in the Vag̱amareg̱a monastery in a stūpa a relic of the Lord, the Śākya sage."
