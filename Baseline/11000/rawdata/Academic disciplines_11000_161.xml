{{Table Digital video broadcast standards}}
{{nihongo|'''1seg'''|ワンセグ|wansegu}} is a mobile terrestrial digital audio/video and data broadcasting service in [[Japan]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Philippines]]. Service began experimentally during 2005 and commercially on April 1, 2006. It is designed as a component of [[ISDB-T]], the terrestrial digital broadcast system used in those countries, as each channel is divided into 13 segments, with a further segment separating it from the next channel; an [[HDTV]] broadcast signal occupies 12 segments, leaving the remaining (13th) '''seg'''ment for mobile receivers, hence the name, "1seg" or "One Seg".

Its use in Brazil was established in late 2007 (starting in just a few cities), with a slight difference from the Japanese counterpart: it is broadcast under a 30 [[frame per second|frame/s]] transmission setting (Japanese broadcasts are under the 15 frame/s transmission setting).

== Technical information ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
{{main article|ISDB}}
[[Image:ISDB-T CH Seg Prog allocation.svg|left|350px|The ISDB-T channel allocation scheme.]]
The [[ISDB]]-T system uses the [[UHF]] band at frequencies between 470 and 770&amp;nbsp;MHz (806&amp;nbsp;MHz in Brazil), giving a total bandwidth 300&amp;nbsp;MHz. The bandwidth is divided into fifty name channels 13 through 62. Each channel is 6&amp;nbsp;MHz wide consisting of a 5.57&amp;nbsp;MHz wide signalling band and a 430&amp;nbsp;kHz guard band to limit cross channel interference. Each of these channels is further divided into 13 segments, each with 428&amp;nbsp;kHz of bandwidth. 1 seg uses a single of these segments to carry the 1seg transport stream.

1seg, like ISDB-T uses [[QPSK]] for [[modulation]], with 2/3 [[forward error correction]] and 1/4 guard ratio. The total datarate is 416 kbit/s.

The television system uses an [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] video stream and an [[HE-AAC]] audio stream multiplexed into an [[MPEG transport stream]]. The maximum video resolution is 320x240 pixels, with a video bitrate of between 220 and 320 kbit/s. Audio conforms to [[HE-AAC]] profile, with a bitrate of 48 to 64 kbit/s. Additional data ([[Electronic program guide|EPG]], interactive services, etc.) is transmitted using [[Broadcast Markup Language|BML]] and occupies the remaining 10 to 100 kbit/s of bandwidth.

Conditional access and copy control are implemented in 1seg broadcasting by the use of [[Broadcast Flag]]-like structure contained in the "Copy Control Descriptor" within the broadcast. The broadcast contents themselves are not encrypted, but  the Copy Control information forces the device to encrypt stored recordings and disallows making a copy of the recording.

== Broadcast Markup Language==
[[Broadcast Markup Language]] (BML), is a data-transmission service allowing text to be displayed on a 1seg TV screen.

The text contains news, sports, weather forecasts, emergency warnings such as [[Earthquake Early Warning (Japan)|Earthquake Early Warning]], etc. free of charge. Further information can be found through links to content on websites, frequently those belonging to the television station itself.

[[EPG]] (program guides) is not included, but transmitted in separate stream (EIT).

== Multiple-program arrangement ==
On June 23, 2008, broadcaster [[Tokyo MX]] officially began using {{nihongo|''multiple-program arrangement''|マルチ編成|Maruchi hensei}} technology to simultaneously broadcast two programs on a single divided segment. Most 1seg receivers manufactured after September 2008 are compatible with this technology. Multiple-program arrangement in 1seg is named as {{nihongo|'''1seg2''' or '''Oneseg2'''|[[:ja:ワンセグ2|ワンセグ2]]|Wansegu tsū}}.

[[NHK Educational TV]] (from 1 April 2009) and {{nihongo|Nara Television|[[:ja:奈良テレビ放送|奈良テレビ放送]]|Nara terebi hōsō}} (from 1 December 2009) are also started for several number of programs.

== Popularity ==
Until the end of March 2008, Japanese regulation required that the programs on 1seg were fundamentally the same as those broadcast on the equivalent HDTV channel. On April 1 the regulation was revised, and experimental programs by 1seg or third parties have begun airing on several stations.

On January 16, 2008, [[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association|JEITA]] released their monthly shipping survey showing approx. 4.806 million [[mobile phone]]s were sold in [[Japan]] in November 2007. Of these, approx. 3.054 million phones, 63.5% of the total, can receive 1seg broadcasts.&lt;!-- receivable capability as first record where as 34.3% of 2.286 million sets in October 2007 shipment. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source; the [[Article (publishing)|article]] of [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] 2008-01-16, area version 13S page 8, and [http://www.jeita.or.jp/japanese/stat/cellular/2007/index.htm (Japanese language);2007 fiscal year monthly base shipment quantity] (2007年度移動電話国内出荷実績、ワンセグ搭載比率（%）)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fiscal year of 2007, on average 45% of mobile phones had 1seg reception capability out of the 22.284 million units sold. The percent increased from 26.8% in April 2007 to 64.2% at end of fiscal year March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeita.or.jp/japanese/stat/cellular/2007/index.htm 2007年度移動電話国内出荷実績]; (2007 fiscal year mobile phone ship out record) (In Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation Introduction Picture.jpg|thumb|alt=text]]
3D [[cell culture]] by the [[magnetic levitation]] method (MLM) is the application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with magnetic [[nanoparticle]] assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields using [[neodymium]] magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of a standard [[petri dish]]. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer [[polylysine]]. [[3D cell culture|3D cell culturing]] is scalable, with the capability for culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to high-throughput low volume systems.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;Souza, G.

==Overview==
Standard [[monolayer]] cell culturing on tissue culture plastic has notably improved our understanding of basic cell biology, but it does not replicate the complex 3D architecture of [[in vivo]] tissue, and it can significantly modify cell properties. This often compromises experiments in basic life science, leads to misleading drug-screening results on [[efficacy]] and [[toxicity]], and produces cells that may lack the characteristics needed for developing tissue regeneration therapies.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;Pampaloni, F., Reynaud, E.

Cell Biol.7, 211-224 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of cell culturing for fundamental studies and biomedical applications lies in the creation of [[multicellular]] structure and organization in three-dimensions.&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Five" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten"&gt;Birgersdotter, A., Sandberg, R. &amp; Ernberg, I.

Regen. Med.1, 83-96 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Many schemes for 3D culturing are being developed or marketed, such as bio-reactors&lt;ref name="Thirteen"&gt;Bilodeau, K. &amp; Mantovani, D.

Enzyme Regul. 47, 196-207 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3D cell culturing system known as the Bio-Assembler™ uses [[biocompatible]] polymer-based&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; [[reagents]] to deliver magnetic nanoparticles to individual cells so that an applied magnetic driver can levitate cells off the bottom of the cell culture dish and rapidly bring cells together near the air-liquid interface. This initiates [[cell-cell interactions]] in the absence of any artificial surface or [[matrix(biology)|matrix]]. Magnetic fields are designed to rapidly form 3D multicellular structures in as little as a few hours, including expression of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins. The [[morphology(biology)|morphology]], [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|protein expression]], and response to [[exogenous]] agents of resulting tissue show great similarity to in vivo results.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

==History==
3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation method (MLM)  was developed from collaboration between scientists at [[Rice University]] and [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; Since then, this technology has been licensed and commercialized by Nano3D Biosciences.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"&gt;"N3D Biosciences, Inc. » ABOUT US." N3D Biosciences, Inc. » ABOUT US. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Aug. 2012. &lt;http://www.n3dbio.com/about/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The magnetic levitation process==
[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation, The Magnetic Levitation Process.png|thumb|center|alt=text]]
Above is a picture showing 3D cell culturing through magnetic levitation with the Bio-Assembler cell culturing system. (A) A magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle assembly known as Nanoshuttle is added and dispersed over cells and the mixture is incubated. (B) After incubation with Nanoshuttle, cells are detached and transferred to a petri dish. (C) A magnetic drive is then placed on top of a petri dish top. (D) The magnetic field causes cells to rise to the air–medium interface. (E) Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) levitated for 60 minutes (left images) and 4 hours (right images) (Scale bar, 50 μm). The onset of cell-cell interaction takes place as soon as cells levitate, and 3D structures start to form. At 1 hour, the cells are still relatively dispersed, but they are already showing some signs of stretching. Formation of 3D structures is visible after 4 hours of levitation (arrows).&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;

==Protein expression==
Protein expression in levitated cultures shows striking similarity to in vivo patterns. N-cadherin expression in levitated human glioblastoma cells was identical to the expression seen in human tumor xenografts grown in immunodeficient mice, while standard 2D culture showed much weaker expression that did not match xenograft distribution as shown in the picture below.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; The transmembrane protein N-cadherin is often used as an indicator of in-vivo-like tissue assembly in 3D culturing.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;
[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation Protein Expression.jpg|thumb|center|alt=text]]
In the picture above, distribution of N-cadherin (red) and nuclei (blue) in human brain cancer mouse xenograft (left, human brain cancer cells grown in a mouse brain), brain cancer cells cultured by 3D magnetic levitation for 48 h. (middle), and cells cultured on a glass slide cover slip (2D, right). The 2D system shows N-cadherin in the cytoplasm and nucleus and notably absent from the membrane, while in the levitated culture and mouse, N-cadherin is clearly concentrated in the membrane, and also present in cytoplasm and cell junctions.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Co-culturing, magnetic manipulation, and invasion assays===
One of the challenges in generating in vivo like cultures or tissue in vitro is the difficulty in co-culturing different cell types. Because of the ability of 3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation to bring cells together, co-culturing different cell types is possible. Co-culturing of different cell types can be achieved at the onset of levitation, by mixing different cell types in before levitation or by magnetically guiding 3D cultures in an invasion assay format.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

The unique ability to manipulate cells and shape tissue magnetically offers new possibilities for controlled co-culturing and invasion assays. Co-culturing in a realistic tissue architecture is critical for accurately modeling in vivo conditions, such as for increasing the accuracy of cellular assays as shown in the figure below.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;
[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation Invasion Assay.jpg|thumb|center|alt=text]]
Shown in the picture above is an invasion assay of magnetically levitated multicellular spheroids.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; Fluorescence images of human glioblastoma (GBM) cells (green; GFP-expressing cells) and normal human astrocytes (NHA) (red; mCherry-labelled) cultured separately and then magnetically guided together (left, time 0). Invasion of GBM into NHAin 3D culture provides a powerful new assay for basic cancer biology and drug screening (right, 12h to 252h).&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;

===Vascular simulation with stem cells===
By facilitating assembly of different populations of cells using the MLM, consistent generation of organoids termed adipospheres capable of simulating the complex intercellular interactions of endogenous white adipose tissue (WAT) can be achieved.&lt;ref name="Sixteen"&gt;Daquinag, A. C., Souza, G. R., Kolonin, M. G. Adipose Tissue Engineering in Three-Dimensional Levitation Tissue Culture System Based on Magnetic Nanoparticles. Tissue Eng. Part C. -Not available-, ahead of print. doi:10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0198 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-culturing 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes in 3D with murine endothelial bEND.3 cells creates a vascular-like network assembly with concomitant lipogenesis in perivascular cells. See figure below.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

In addition to cell lines, WAT organogenesis can be simulated from primary cells.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

Adipocyte-depleted stromal vascular fraction (SVF) containing adipose stromal cells (ASC), endothelial cells, and infiltrating leukocyte derived from mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) were cultured in 3D. This revealed organoids striking in hierarchical organization with distinct capsule and internal large vessel-like structures lined with endothelial cells, as well as perivascular localization of ASC.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

Upon adipogenesis induction of either 3T3-L1 adipospheres or adipospheres derived from SVF, the cells efficiently formed large lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes in vivo, whereas only smaller lipid droplet formation is achievable in 2D. This indicates intercellular signaling that better recapitulates WAT organogenesis.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

This MLM for 3D co-culturing creates adipospheres appropriate for WAT modeling ex vivo and provides a new platform for functional screens to identify molecules bioactive toward individual adipose cell populations. It can also be adopted for WAT transplantation applications and aid other approaches to WAT-based cell therapy.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

===Organized co-culturing to create in vivo-like tissue===
Using the MagPen™ (a Nano3D Biosciences, Inc. product), organized 3D co-cultures similar to native tissue architecture can be rapidly created. Endothelial cells (PEC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), fibroblasts (PF), and epithelial cells (EpiC) cultured with the Bio-Assembler™ can be sequentially layered in a drag-and-drop manner to create bronchioles that maintain phenotype and induce extracellular matrix formation.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"&gt;Tseng, H., Gage, J. A., Raphael, R., Moore, R. H., Killian, T. C., [[Jane Grande-Allen|Grande-Allen, K. J.]], Souza, G. R. Assembly of a three-dimensional multitype bronchiole co-culture model using magnetic levitation. Tissue Eng. Part C. -Not available-, ahead of print. doi:10.1089/ten.TEC.2012.0157 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ab urbe condita''}}
[[Image:Antoninianus-Pacatianus-1001-RIC 0006cf.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Antoninianus]] of [[Pacatianus]], [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] in 248. It bears the legend ROMAE AETER[NAE] AN[NO] MIL[LESIMO] ET PRIMO, "To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year".]]
'''''Ab urbe condita''''' ({{IPA-la|ab ˈʊrbɛ ˈkɔndɪtaː}}), or '''''Anno urbis conditæ''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈannoː ˈʊrbɪs ˈkɔndɪtae̯}}), often abbreviated as AUC in either case, is a convention that was used in antiquity and by [[Classicist|classical historians]] to refer to a given year in [[Ancient Rome]].  ''Ab urbe condita'' literally means "from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]]," while ''anno urbis conditæ'' means "in the year since the City's founding."  Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, [[753 BC]], would be written AUC 1, while [[AD 1]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 BC would be AUC 727.

Usage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity.  In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as was the [[Diocletian era]] in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to  [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ([[1st century BC|First Century BC]]). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls "''ab urbe condita'' 245," accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.

From the time of [[Claudius]] (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{cn|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.

In AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum|sæculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "[y]ear one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Sæculum Novum''.

==Calendar era==
{{see|Calendar era}}
The [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. 
Dionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the 
[[Diocletian era]].
This convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.&lt;ref&gt;
J. David Thomas, "On Dating by Regnal Years of Diocletian, Maximian and the Caesars", 
''Chronique d'Egypte'' 46.91 (1971),  173&amp;ndash;179, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234 doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234].&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of  Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ …").&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&amp;id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&amp;ndash;780.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has later been calculated{{by whom|date=May 2018}} (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. 
Thus, 
* AUC 1 = 753 BC
* AUC 753 = 1 BC
* AUC 754 = AD 1 
* AUC 1000 = AD 247
* AUC 2753 = AD 2000
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+752}} = AD {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9610">'''Adipogenesis''' is the process of [[cell differentiation]] by which [[pre-adipocyte]]s become [[adipocyte]]s. Adipogenesis has been one of the most intensively studied models of cellular differentiation.[[File:Differentiated 3T3-L1 Cell line stained with Oil O Red.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Differentiated Adipocyte stained with [[Oil Red O]]]]

==Introduction==
[[Adipocytes]] play a vital role in energy homeostasis and process the largest energy reserve as [[triglycerol]] in the body of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornelius|first=P|author2=MacDougald, OA|author3=Lane, MD|title=Regulation of adipocyte development.|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|year=1994|volume=14|pages=99–129|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.000531|pmid=7946535|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.000531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adipocytes stay in a dynamic state, they start expanding when the energy intake is higher than the expenditure and undergo mobilization when the energy expenditure exceeds the intake. This process is highly regulated by counter regulatory hormones to which these cells are very sensitive. The hormone [[insulin]] promotes expansion whereas the counter hormones [[epinephrine]], [[glucagon]],and 
[[ACTH]] promote mobilization. Adipogenesis is a tightly regulated cellular differentiation process, in which the preadipocytes are transformed into differentiated adipocyte cells. Comparing with cells from other lineage, the in vitro differentiation of fat cells is authentic and recapitulates most of the characteristic feature of in vivo adipogenesis. The key features of differentiated adipocytes are morphological change, growth arrest, high expression of lipogenic genes and production of hormones like [[leptin]], [[resistin]] (in the mouse, not in humans) and [[TNF-alpha]].

==Models of differentiation==

===In vitro===
The transition of the fibroblast cells to mature adipocytes is one of the best characterized processes of cellular differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDougald|first=OA|author2=Lane, MD|title=Transcriptional regulation of gene expression during adipocyte differentiation.|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=1995|volume=64|pages=345–73|pmid=7574486|doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.64.070195.002021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary preadipose cells can be isolated from the [[stromal vascular fraction]] of adipose tissue; and when treated in cell culture with a combination of adipogenic effectors, they can differentiate into adipocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkland|first=JL|author2=Hollenberg, CH|author3=Gillon, WS|title=Age, anatomic site, and the replication and differentiation of adipocyte precursors.|journal=The American Journal of Physiology|date=Feb 1990|volume=258|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=C206-10|pmid=2305864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amelogenin''' is the name for a series of closely related [[protein]]s involved in [[amelogenesis]], the development of [[tooth enamel|enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Amelogenin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a type of [[Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix (ECM)]] protein, which, together with [[ameloblastin]]s, [[enamelin]]s, and [[tuftelin]]s direct the mineralization of enamel to form a highly organized matrix of [[enamel rod|rods]], interrod crystal, and protein.  Although the precise role of amelogenin(s) in regulating the [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] process is unknown, it is known that amelogenins are abundant during amelogenesis.  Developing human enamel contains about 70% protein, 90% of which are amelogenins.

== Function ==
Amelogenins are believed to be involved in the organizing of [[enamel rod]]s during [[tooth development]]. The latest research indicates that these proteins regulate the initiation and growth of [[hydroxyapatite]] crystals during the mineralization of enamel. In addition, amelogenins appear to aid in the development of [[cementum]] by directing cementoblasts to the tooth's root surface.

== Variants ==
The amelogenin [[gene]] has been most widely studied in humans, where it is a single copy gene, located on the [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome]]s at Xp22.1-Xp22.3 and Yp 11.2 [5].&lt;ref name="pmid2004775"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Nakahori Y, Takenaka O, Nakagome Y |url= |format=|title=A human X-Y homologous region encodes "amelogenin" |journal=Genomics |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=264–9 |year=1991|pmid=2004775 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(91)90251-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amelogenin gene’s location on sex chromosomes has implications for variability both between the X chromosome form ([[AMELX]]) and the Y chromosome form ([[AMELY]]), and between alleles of AMELY among different populations.  This is because AMELY exists in the [[genetic recombination|non-recombining]] region of chromosome Y, effectively isolating it from normal [[selection pressure]]s.  Other sources of amelogenin variation arise from the various [[protein isoform|isoforms]] of AMELX obtained from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts.  Specific roles for isoforms have yet to be established.  Among other organisms, amelogenin is well conserved among [[eutheria]]ns, and has homologs in [[monotreme]]s, reptiles and amphibians.

== Application in sex determination ==
Differences between the [[X chromosome]] and [[Y chromosome]] versions of the amelogenin gene (AMELX and AMELY respectively) enable it to be used in sex determination of unknown human samples.  [[AMELX]]’s intron 1 contains a 6 bp deletion relative to [[intron]] 1 of [[AMELY]].  This can be detected at low cost using Polymerase Chain Reaction ([[PCR]]) of intron 1, followed by [[gel electrophoresis]].  Two [[amplicon|bands]] of DNA, at 106bps and 112bps, are resolved if both the AMELX and AMELY versions of the gene are present (i.e. the sample is from a male) or one band of DNA, at 106bps, if the AMELX version only is present (i.e. the sample is from a female).&lt;ref name="pmid16603093"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kashyap VK, Sahoo S, Sitalaximi T, Trivedi R |title = Deletions in the Y-derived amelogenin gene fragment in the Indian population | journal = BMC Med Genet | volume = 7 | pages = 37 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16603093 | doi =10.1186/1471-2350-7-37 | pmc = 1458324 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-07-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However because of [[AMELY]] variation among individuals and populations, this method of sex determination is not 100% accurate.  Mutation in regions of AMELY intron 1 commonly used as [[nucleic acid thermodynamics|primer annealing sites]] may disable PCR amplification.  A 6bp [[indel|insertion]] to AMELY intron 1 results in an amplicon identical in length to that of AMELX.  In some males AMELY may be deleted entirely.  In any of these cases only one band is visualized during gel electrophoresis of PCR products, causing misidentification of the sample as female.&lt;ref name="pmid16603093"/&gt; The misidentification rate may vary among populations, but in general appears to be low. In one study in Spain, the amelogenin sex determination test using AMELX (977bps) and AMELY (790bps) bands was performed for 1224 individuals of known gender with a 99.84% (1222/1224) accuracy rate.&lt;ref name="pmid17716640"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Francès F, Portolés O, González JI, Coltell O, Verdú F, Castelló A, Corella D |url= |format=|title=Amelogenin test: From forensics to quality control in clinical and biochemical genomics |journal=Clin Chim Acta |volume=386 |issue=1–2 |pages=53–6|year=2007|pmid=17716640 |doi=10.1016/j.cca.2007.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study in India, however, found 5 of its 270 men studied (1.85%) possessed an AMELY deletion, terming them “deleted-amelogenin males” (DAMs). In response the authors suggested that while the amelogenin sex test may be accurate in general, other Y chromosome markers such as [[SRY]], STR, or 50f2 can be used for less ambiguous gender identification.&lt;ref name="pmid12056520"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Thangaraj K, Reddy AG, Singh L |url= |format=|title=Is the amelogenin gene reliable for gender identification in forensic casework and prenatal diagnosis? |journal=Int J Legal Med |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=121–3|year=2002|pmid=12056520|doi=10.1007/s00414-001-0262-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound measurements}}

An '''audio frequency''' (abbreviation: '''AF''') or '''audible frequency''' is characterized as a [[periodic function|periodic]] [[vibration]] whose [[frequency]] is audible to the average human. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of audio frequency is the [[hertz]] (Hz). It is the property of [[sound]] that most determines [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Pilhofer |first1=Michael |title=Music Theory for Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxcviUw4KX8C|year=2007|publisher=For Dummies|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generally accepted standard [[Hearing range|range of audible frequencies]] for humans is 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyperphysics|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/earsens.html|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heffner|first1=Henry|last2=Heffner|first2=Rickye|title=Hearing Ranges of Laboratory Animals|journal=American Association for Laboratory Animal Science|date=January 2007|volume=46|issue=1|page=20|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/jaalas/2007/00000046/00000001/art00003|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stuart|title=Signals and Systems for Speech and Hearing|date=2011|publisher=BRILL|page=163|edition=2nd|quote=For auditory signals and human listeners, the accepted range is 20Hz to 20kHz, the limits of human hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the range of frequencies individuals hear is greatly influenced by environmental factors. Frequencies below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz are generally felt rather than heard, assuming the [[amplitude]] of the vibration is great enough. High frequencies are the first to be affected by [[hearing loss]] due to age or prolonged exposure to very loud noises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bitner-Glindzicz|first1=M|title=Hereditary deafness and phenotyping in humans.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=2002|volume=63|issue=1|pages=73–94|pmid=12324385|doi=10.1093/bmb/63.1.73}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=Article is about genetic prelingual hearing loss|date=April 2018}}

[[File:TsIAM logo.png|right|Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development logo|alt= Institute logo: the Russian letters ''tse, i, a and em'']]
The P. I. '''Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development''' (also known as the "Central Institute for Aviation Motor Development named after P. I. Baranov" or simply "Central Institute of Aviation Motors", CIAM or TsIAM, ''Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya'', {{lang-ru|Центральный Институт Авиационного Моторостроения}}) is the only specialized Russian research and engineering facility dealing with advanced aerospace propulsion research, aircraft engine [[Product certification|certification]] and other [[Gas-dynamic|gas dynamics]]-related issues. It was founded in 1930.

CIAM operates the largest aerospace engine testing facility in [[Europe]], surpassed only by the United States's [[Arnold Engineering Development Center]] and [[Glenn Research Center]]. It is based in [[Lefortovo District|Lefortovo]] (the southeast okrug of [[Moscow]]) with an address of 2 [[Aviamotornaya (street)|Aviamotornaya]] street, Moscow, [[Postcode]] 111116. CIAM also operates a scientific testing center in [[Lytkarino]], [[Moscow Oblast]].

== History ==
The bases of the institute were formed by such academics as [[Mstislav Keldysh|Keldysh]], [[Klimov]] and [[Vladimir Chelomei|Chelomey]]. Since its foundation in 1930, CIAM designed nearly all Russian aviation motors and gas turbines. In 1933 CIAM was named after the late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Vice-[[Council of People's Commissars|Narkom]] of [[Heavy Industry]] Petr Ionovich Baranov, who was one of the leading theorists of the Soviet aviation industry. Before [[World War II]], all engine-design work was transferred to mass-production motor-building plants and their own [[design bureau]]s. CIAM focused on theoretical and experimental research and modernization of prototypes up to the production stage.

After the war, CIAM was engaged with reactive (jet) engines for airplanes, successors to the first-generation [[turbojet]]s. In the early 1950s, the largest test base in Europe was built in Lytkarino. In the 1970s, the institute began work on a [[ramjet]] engine using the special [[hypersonic]] "flying laboratory" [[GLL Holod]]. This experiment used a [[liquid hydrogen]], actively cooled dual-mode ramjet, which was based on a hydrogen-fueled axisymmetrical engine placed on a Russian [[SA-5 Gammon|SA5]] missile during the flight. The first successful test achieved Mach 5.6 in 1991, and the maximum speed achieved was Mach 5.7 in November 1992. A test with a goal of Mach 6.3 failed in March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=Paper&amp;gID=30313 French-Russian Analysis of Kholod Dual-Mode Ramjet Flight Experiments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181756/http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=Paper&amp;gID=30313 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the USSR]], CIAM lost a large number of emigrating engineers. With the loss of government support and a lack of state aviation strategy, CIAM stayed afloat with contracts with China, French corporations, [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] and by offering logistical services. As of 2011, the situation has stabilized; CIAM leads some Russian programs, including development of the new perspective [[scramjet]] [[GLL Igla]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netwrx1.com/skunk-works/v02.n027 French Support Russian SCRAMJET Tests.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224171520/http://www.netwrx1.com/skunk-works/v02.n027 |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also researches [[gas pipeline]]s; in March 2006, the institute signed an agreement with JSC [[Gasprom]].

Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the [[ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] distributions of plant and animal [[species]] around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sven Erik |title=Explanation of ecological rules and observation by application of ecosystem theory and ecological models|journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=158 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allee |first=W.C. |last2=Schmidt |first2=K.P. |date=1951 |title=Ecological Animal Geography |edition=2nd |pages=457, 460–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing [[tetrapod]]s (in modern terms, terrestrial placental [[mammal]]s). Among his rules were that [[brood size]] decreases with adult body mass, while [[life expectancy|lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]] and with body mass, and [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as [[scientific model|models]] to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (from 1828 onwards) on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]],&lt;ref name=Lovtrup/&gt; and of [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] on animal pigmentation, in 1833.&lt;ref name=Gloger/&gt;
There is some [[scepticism]] among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book ''Biogeography and Plate Tectonics'', comments that while [[Willi Hennig]]'s rules on [[cladistics]] "have generally been helpful", his progression rule is "suspect".&lt;ref name="Briggs1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=J.C. |title=Biogeography and Plate Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCNG2e5K-YgC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086851-6 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the variance of data is not simply noise interfering with the detection of so-called "main effects", but also an indicator of stressful conditions leading to greater vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewontin, Richard |author1link=Richard Lewontin |author2=Levins, Richard |title=Schmalhausen's Law |journal=Capitalism, Nature, Socialism |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Thorson's rule]]''' states that [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]] at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to [[pelagic]] (often planktotrophic &lt;nowiki&gt;[plankton-feeding]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and widely dispersing larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring, often by [[viviparity]] or [[ovoviviparity]], which are often brooded.&lt;ref name="Thorson"&gt;Thorson, G. 1957 Bottom communities (sublittoral or shallow shelf).

* '''[[Van Valen's law]]''' states that the probability of [[extinction]] for species and higher taxa (such as families and orders) is constant for each group over time; groups grow neither more resistant nor more vulnerable to extinction, however old their lineage is. It is named for the evolutionary biologist [[Leigh Van Valen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leigh Van Valen, evolutionary theorist and paleobiology pioneer, 1935-2010 |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2010/10/19/leigh-van-valen-evolutionary-theorist-and-paleobiology-pioneer-1935-2010 |publisher=University of Chicago |date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[von Baer's laws (embryology)|von Baer's laws]]''', discovered by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], state that [[embryo]]s start from a common form and develop into increasingly specialised forms, so that the diversification of embryonic form mirrors the [[tree of life (biology)|taxonomic and phylogenetic tree]]. Therefore, all animals in a phylum share a similar early embryo; animals in smaller taxa (classes, orders, families, genera, species) share later and later embryonic stages. This was in sharp contrast to the [[recapitulation theory]] of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]] (and later of [[Ernst Haeckel]]), which claimed that embryos went through stages resembling adult organisms from successive stages of the ''[[scala naturae]]'' from supposedly lowest to highest levels of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |authorlink=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922|volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovtrup&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovtrup |first1=Soren |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348 |doi=10.2307/2412887}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Williston's law]]''', first noticed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], states that parts in an organism tend to become reduced in number and greatly specialized in function.

[[File:Nrcc 600 c and load.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Small furnace capable of 600°C and of applying a static load for testing building materials]]'''Building science''' is the collection of [[scientific knowledge]] that focuses on the analysis of the physical phenomena affecting buildings. ''Building physics, architectural science'' and ''applied physics'' are terms used for the knowledge domain that overlaps with building science.

Building science traditionally includes the study of indoor thermal environment, [[Architectural acoustics|indoor acoustic environment]], [[Architectural lighting design|indoor light environment]], [[indoor air quality]], and building resource use, including energy and [[building material]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876592619|title=Introduction to architectural science : the basis of sustainable design|last=V.,|first=Szokolay, S.|isbn=9781317918592|edition= Third|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=876592619}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas are studied in terms of physical principles, relationship to building occupant health, [[Thermal comfort|comfort]], and productivity, and how they can be controlled by the [[building envelope]] and electrical and [[HVAC|mechanical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867852750|title=Heating, cooling, lighting : sustainable design methods for architects|last=Norbert,|first=Lechner,|isbn=9781118849453|edition= Fourth|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|oclc=867852750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) additionally includes the areas of [[building information modeling]], [[New-construction building commissioning|building commissioning]], [[fire protection engineering]], [[Seismic analysis|seismic design]] and resilient design within its scope.[https://www.nibs.org/page/about]

The practical purpose of building science is to provide predictive capability to optimize the [[building performance]] and [[Sustainable architecture|sustainability]] of new and existing buildings, understand or prevent building failures, and guide the design of new techniques and technologies.

==Applications==
During the architectural design process, building science knowledge is used to inform design decisions to optimize building performance. Design decisions can be made based on knowledge of building science principles and established guidelines, such as the NIBS [[Whole Building Design Guide|Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG)]] and the collection of [[ASHRAE#Publications|ASHRAE Standards]] related to building science.

Computational tools can be used during design to [[Building performance simulation|simulate building performance]] based on input information about the designed [[building envelope]], [[Architectural lighting design|lighting system]], and [[HVAC|mechanical system]]. Models can be used to predict [[Energy modeling|energy]] use over the building life, solar heat and radiation distribution, [[Computational fluid dynamics|air flow]], and other physical phenomena within the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/244063540|title=Building performance simulation for design and operation|date=2011|publisher=Spon Press|others=Hensen, Jan., Lamberts, Roberto.|isbn=9780415474146|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=244063540}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools are valuable for evaluating a design and ensuring it will perform within an acceptable range before construction begins. Many of the available computational tools have the capability to analyze building performance goals and perform [[Design Optimization|design optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Anh-Tuan|last2=Reiter|first2=Sigrid|last3=Rigo|first3=Philippe|date=2014-01-01|title=A review on simulation-based optimization methods applied to building performance analysis|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306261913007058|journal=Applied Energy|volume=113|pages=1043–1058|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.08.061|issn=0306-2619|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of the models is influenced by the modeler’s knowledge of building science principles and by the amount of [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|validation]] performed for the specific program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/244063540|title=Building performance simulation for design and operation|date=2011|publisher=Spon Press|others=Hensen, Jan., Lamberts, Roberto.|isbn=9780415474146|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=244063540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When existing buildings are being evaluated, measurements and computational tools can be used to evaluate performance based on measured existing conditions. An array of in-field testing equipment can be used to measure temperature, moisture, sound levels, air pollutants, or other criteria. Standardized procedures for taking these measurements are provided in the Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/826659791|title=Performance measurement protocols for commercial buildings|date=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers|others=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers., U.S. Green Building Council., Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers.|isbn=9781461918226|location=Atlanta|oclc=826659791}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Thermographic camera|thermal infrared (IR) imaging devices]] can be used to measure temperatures of building components while the building is in use. These measurements can be used to evaluate how the mechanical system is operating and if there are areas of anomalous heat gain or heat loss through the building envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balaras|first=C.A.|last2=Argiriou|first2=A.A.|date=2002-02-01|title=Infrared thermography for building diagnostics|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378778801001050|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=34|issue=2|pages=171–183|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(01)00105-0|issn=0378-7788|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of conditions in existing buildings are used as part of [[Post-occupancy evaluation|post occupancy evaluations]]. Post occupancy evaluations may also include surveys [https://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/survey.htm] of building occupants to gather data on occupant satisfaction and well-being and to gather qualitative data on building performance that may not have been captured by measurement devices.

Many aspects of building science are the responsibility of the [[architect]] (in Canada, many architectural firms employ an [[architectural technologist]] for this purpose), often in collaboration with the engineering disciplines that have evolved to handle 'non-building envelope' building science concerns: 
[[Civil engineering]], [[Structural engineering]], [[Earthquake engineering]], [[Geotechnical engineering]], Mechanical engineering, Electrical engineering, [[Acoustic engineering]], &amp; fire code engineering. Even the interior designer will inevitably generate a few building science issues.

==Topics==

===Indoor environmental quality (IEQ)===
Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building’s environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it. IEQ is determined by many factors, including lighting, air quality, and damp conditions. Workers are often concerned that they have symptoms or health conditions from exposures to contaminants in the buildings where they work. One reason for this concern is that their symptoms often get better when they are not in the building. While research has shown that some respiratory symptoms and illnesses can be associated with damp buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisk|first=W. J.|last2=Lei-Gomez|first2=Q.|last3=Mendell|first3=M. J.|date=2007-07-25|title=Meta-analyses of the associations of respiratory health effects with dampness and mold in homes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2007.00475.x|journal=Indoor Air|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=284–296|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2007.00475.x|issn=0905-6947|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still unclear what measurements of indoor contaminants show that workers are at risk for disease. In most instances where a worker and his or her physician suspect that the building environment is causing a specific health condition, the information available from medical tests and tests of the environment is not sufficient to establish which contaminants are responsible. Despite uncertainty about what to measure and how to interpret what is measured, research shows that building-related symptoms are associated with building characteristics, including dampness, cleanliness, and ventilation characteristics.
Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.
Understanding the sources of indoor environmental contaminants and controlling them can often help prevent or resolve building-related worker symptoms. Practical guidance for improving and maintaining the indoor environment is available.[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/]

Building indoor environment covers the environmental aspects in the design, analysis, and operation of energy-efficient, healthy, and comfortable buildings.  Fields of specialization include architecture, [[HVAC]] design, [[Thermal Comfort|thermal comfort]], [[Indoor Air Quality|indoor air quality]] (IAQ), [[lighting]], [[Architectural acoustics|acoustics]], and [[control systems]].

===HVAC systems===
The mechanical systems, usually a sub-set of the broader Building Services, used to control the temperature, humidity, pressure and other select aspects of the indoor environment are often described as the Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems.
These systems have grown in complexity and importance (often consuming around 20% of the total budget in commercial buildings) as occupants demand tighter control of conditions, buildings become larger, and enclosures and passive measures became less important as a means of providing comfort.

Building science includes the analysis of HVAC systems for both physical impacts (heat distribution, air velocities, relative humidities, etc.) and for effect on the comfort of the building's occupants. Because occupants' perceived comfort is dependent on factors such as current weather and the type of climate the building is located in, the needs for HVAC systems to provide comfortable conditions will vary across projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brager|first=Gail S.|last2=de Dear|first2=Richard J.|date=1998-02-01|title=Thermal adaptation in the built environment: a literature review|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378778897000534|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=27|issue=1|pages=83–96|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(97)00053-4|issn=0378-7788|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enclosure (envelope) systems===
The building enclosure is the part of the building that separates the indoors from the outdoors. This includes the wall, roof, windows, slabs on grade, and joints between all of these. The comfort, productivity, and even health of building occupants in areas near the building enclosure (i.e., perimeter zones) are affected by outdoor influences such as noise, temperature, and solar radiation, and by their ability to control these influences. As part of its function, the enclosure must control (not necessarily block or stop) the flow of heat, air, vapor, solar radiation, insects, noise, etc.
Daylight transmittance through glazed components of the facade can be analyzed to evaluate the reduced need for electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=R.P.|date=2003-02-01|title=Capturing the daylight dividend in buildings: why and how?|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S036013230200118X|journal=Building and Environment|volume=38|issue=2|pages=381–385|doi=10.1016/s0360-1323(02)00118-x|issn=0360-1323|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building sustainability===
Part of building science is the attempt to design buildings with consideration for the future and the resources and realities of tomorrow. This field may also be referred to as [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]].

A push towards [[zero-energy building]] also known as Net-Zero Energy Building has been present in the Building Science field. The qualifications for Net Zero Energy Building Certification can be found on the [[Living Building Challenge]] website.

==Certification==
There are no professional architecture or engineering certifications for building science. It is currently a specialization within these broad areas of practice. In the US contractors certified by the Building Performance Institute, an independent organization, advertise that they operate businesses as Building Scientists.  This is questionable due to their lack of scientific background and credentials. This is true in Canada for most of the Certified Energy Advisors. However, many of these trades and technologists require and receive some training in very specific areas of building science (e.g., air tightness, or thermal insulation).

==Research==

The main goal of the Carl Sagan Institute is to model atmospheric [[spectral signature]]s including [[biosignature]]s of known and hypothetical planets and moons to explore whether they could be habitable and how they could be detected.&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute - Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research focuses on exoplanets and moons  orbiting in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] around their host stars.

A '''chord''' is a concurrency construct available in [[Polyphonic C sharp|Polyphonic C♯]] and [[Cω]] inspired by the join pattern of the [[join-calculus]].  A chord is a function body that is associated with multiple function headers and cannot execute until all function headers are called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/doc/comega_whatis.htm | title=Cω Overview | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synchronicity ==
[[Cω]] defines two types of functions synchronous and asynchronous.  A synchronous function acts like a standard function in most Object-Oriented Language, upon invocation the function body is executed and a return value may or may not be returned to the caller.  An asynchronous function acts similar to a function that returns void except that it is guaranteed to return immediately with the execution being done in a separate thread.

[[File:Spatial Contextual Awareness Fig 2.png|thumb|Diagram showing elements of spatial contextual (or geographic) awareness.|350px]]

'''Cognitive geography''' is an interdisciplinary study of cognitive science and geography. It aims to understand how humans view space, place, and environment. It involves the formalization of factors that influence our spatial cognition to create a more effective representation of space. These improved models assist in a variety of issues, for example, the developing maps that communicate better, providing navigation instructions that are easier to follow, utilizing space more practically, accounting for the cultural differences on spatial thinking for more effective cross-cultural information exchange, and an overall increased understanding of our environment.

Notable researchers in this branch of geography include [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]], [[Daniel R. Montello|Daniel Montello]], Max J. Egenhofer, [[Andrew U. Frank|Andrew U Frank]], Christian Freksa, [[Edward C. Tolman|Edward Tolman]], and [[Barbara Tversky]], among others.

Conference on Spatial Information Theory (COSIT) is a biennial international conference with a focus on the theoretical aspect of space and spatial information.

The US National Research Council published a book titled, “Learning to think spatially (2006)” written by the Committee on Support for Thinking Spatially. The committee believes that incorporating GIS and other spatial technologies in K-12 curriculum would promote spatial thinking and reasoning.

== Origin and early works ==
The connection between spatial cognition and human activity and survival exists from ancient times. As learned from etymology, geometry has its origins in land surveying of the annual floods of the Nile river.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=David M.|last2=Freksa|first2=Christian|last3=Hirtle|first3=Stephen C.|last4=Lloyd|first4=Robert|last5=Tversky|first5=Barbara|date=1999-12-01|title=Cognitive models of geographical space|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/136588199241003|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|volume=13|issue=8|pages=747–774|doi=10.1080/136588199241003|issn=1365-8816}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spatial cognition]] developed from the study of cognitive psychology which began to be considered as a separate field in the late 1960s through [[Ulric Neisser]]’s book ''Cognitive Psychology'' (1967).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially, research on spatial cognition was hindered due to many leading researchers believing that visual and spatial world could be explained using language processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later on, research on imagery showed that by reducing the representation of the visual and spatial world into language researchers ignored ‘fascinating’ issues.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, Stephen Michael. ''Image and mind''. Harvard University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1978-01-01|title=Cognitive processes that resemble perceptual processes.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1978-19902-007|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, geographers were studying how people perceived and remembered the geographical world.&lt;ref&gt;O'keefe, John, and Lynn Nadel. ''The hippocampus as a cognitive map''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive geography and [[behavioral geography]] draw from early [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] works such as [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s concepts of "cognitive maps". More cognitively oriented, these geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are [[Materialism|materialists]] and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the [[landscape]] patterns or even [[Collective identity|group identity]].&lt;ref name="Norton97"&gt;Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. ''The Psychological Record'', 47, 439–460&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of early works on Cognitive Geography include [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman’s]] `Cognitive maps in rats and men’ compared the behavior of laboratory rats with the navigation and wayfinding abilities of humans. Similar work during that period dealt with the peoples’ perception of direction and spatial relations, for example, Americans typically think that South America is aligned directly south of North America when in fact most of South America is much further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Barbara|date=1981-07-01|title=Distortions in memory for maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028581900165|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=13|issue=3|pages=407–433|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 70s, the focus was on how to improve maps by providing useful information, delivering an understandable message, and making it more aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research in cognitive geography ==
The interaction between humans and the environment is a major focus among the Geographers. The objective of this research area is to minimize the disparity between the environment and its geometric representation and the removal of spatial cognitive biases that are inherent. Examples of spatial cognitive biases include the overestimation of distance between two locations when there is a large number of intersections and nodes in the path. There is a tendency to recollect irregular streets or rivers as straighter, more parallel, or more perpendicular than they are. [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]] through his research illustrates how spatial features like inland water bodies (lakes, ponds, lagoons) are categorized differently in English and French speaking population, and therefore, could cause issues in cross-cultural geographical information exchange.

Studies have been done on wayfinding and navigation. Wayfinding is defined as “the mental processes involved in determining a route between two points and then following that route” and involves planning trips, optimizing routes, and exploring different places. The researchers are trying to find the perfect amount of information, not more and not less, for making navigation more efficient. Landmarks play an important factor in wayfinding and navigation, therefore, researchers are looking to automate the selection of landmarks which would make maps easier to follow.

Displaying information through maps has been shaped by how humans sense space and direction. Communicating effectively through maps is a challenge for many cartographers. For example, symbols, their color, and their relative size have an important role to play in the interaction between the map and the mapmaker.

The study of Geo-ontology has also been of interest to researchers in this field. Geo-ontology involves the study of the variations among different cultures in how they view and sense landforms, how to communicate spatial knowledge with other cultures while overcoming such barriers, an understanding of the cognitive aspects of spatial relations, and how to represent them in computational models.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, David M. "Spatial representation: a cognitive view." ''Geographical information systems: Principles and applications'' 1 (1999): 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there might be some geographic meaning that might not be well explained using words. There might be some differences in understanding when spatial information is explained verbally instead of non-verbal form.

Some of the questions that cognitive geographers deal with include the influence of scale on the information provided in maps, the difference in how we view geographic knowledge differently from different sources, for example, text-based, map-based, or any real-world experience. A typical study in Cognitive Geography involves volunteers responding to a questionnaire after being shown some spatial information. The researchers use this data to find the spectrum of interpretations by the volunteers about the subject in focus.&lt;ref&gt;Montello, Daniel R. "Cognitive research in GIScience: Recent achievements and future prospects." ''Geography Compass'' 3.5 (2009): 1824-1840.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montello, Daniel R. "Cognitive geography." (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''combat engineer''' (also called '''field engineer''', '''[[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]''' or '''[[sapper]]''' in many armies) is a [[soldier]] who performs a variety of [[construction]] and [[demolition]] tasks under combat conditions.

The combat engineer's goals involve facilitating movement and support of friendly forces while impeding those of the enemy. Combat engineers build fighting positions, fortifications, and roads. They conduct demolitions missions and clear minefields using  [[Assault Breacher Vehicle|specialized vehicles]]. Typical combat engineer missions include construction and breaching of trenches, tank traps and other [[fortification]]s; [[bunker]] construction; [[bridge]] and [[road]] construction or destruction; laying or clearing [[land mine]]s; and combined arms breaching.  Typically, a combat engineer is also trained as an infantryman, and combat engineer units often have a secondary role fighting as infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usacac.army.mil/sites/default/files/misc/doctrine/CDG/cdg_resources/manuals/fm/fm3_34.pdf U.S. Army Field Manual 3-34, Engineer Operations, page 1-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRRwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=combat%20engineers%20fight%20as%20infantry%20army%20fm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jLSxLpuckE&amp;sig=VOFP9dR0PlTdv4nnHciyeSB_MDE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT8cHIjIbRAhXi5oMKHcUwBpgQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=combat%20engineers%20fight%20as%20infantry%20army%20fm&amp;f=false|title=1111th Engineer Group In The Bulge: The Role Of Engineers As Infantry In Airland Battle|first=Major Francis M.

==Terminology==
A general combat engineer is often called a ''[[pioneer (military)|pioneer]]'' or ''[[sapper]]'', terms derived respectively from the [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] armies. In some armies, ''pioneer'' and ''sapper'' indicate specific [[military rank]]s and levels of combat engineers, who work under fire in all seasons, may be allocated to different corps, as they were in the former Soviet Army, or they may be organized in the same corps. [[Geomatics]] (surveying and cartography) is another area of military engineering but is often performed by the combat engineers of some nations and in other cases is a separate responsibility, as was formerly the case in the Australian Army. While the officers of a combat engineering unit may be professionally certified civil or mechanical engineers, the non-commissioned members are generally not.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

* [[Sapper]]:
** In the U.S., British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand armies, is a soldier who has specialized combat engineer training.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
** In the [[Israeli Defence Forces]], '''Sapper (פלס)''' is a military profession code denoting a combat engineer who has graduated from various levels of combat engineering training. Sapper 05 is the basic level, Sapper 06 is the general level, Sapper 08 is the combat engineer commander's level and Sapper 11 is the combat engineer [[officer]] level. All IDF sappers are also trained as [[Rifleman]] 07, matching [[infantry]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}
** In the [[Canadian Army]], is a term for soldiers that have completed the basic Combat Engineer training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.ca/fr/job/sapeursapeusedecombat-5 |title=Sapeur / Sapeuse de combat |publisher=Forces.Ca |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** In the [[Portuguese Army]], a '''''sapador de engenharia''''' (engineering sapper) is a soldier of the engineering branch that has specialized combat engineer training. A '''''sapador de infantaria''''' (infantry sapper) is a soldier of the infantry branch that has a similar training and that usually serves in the combat support sapper platoon of an infantry battalion.
**The [[Italian Army]] uses the term "'''Guastatori'''" for their combat engineers.
*[[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]]:
** In the [[Finnish army]], '''''pioneeri''''' is the private equivalent rank in the army for a soldier who has completed the basic combat engineering training. Naval engineers retain the rank ''matruusi'' but bear the ''pioneeri'' insignia on their sleeves.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
** The German [[Bundeswehr]] uses the term "Pionier" for their combat engineers and other specialized units, who are associated with Special Forces to clear obstacles and perform engineering duties. Also the combat engineers in the Austro-Hungarian [[k.u.k.]] Forces were called "Pioniere".{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*[[Assault pioneer]]:
** In the British, Canadian and Australian armies, an '''assault pioneer''' is an infantry soldier with some limited combat engineer training in clearing obstacles during assaults and light engineering duties. Until recently, assault pioneers were responsible for the operation of [[flamethrower]]s.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
* Field engineer:
** is a term used (or formerly used) in many Commonwealth armies. In modern usage, it is often synonymous with "combat engineer".  However, the term originally identified those military engineers who supported an army operating in the field as opposed to garrison engineers who built and supported permanent fix bases.  In its original usage, "field engineering" would have been inclusive of but broader than "combat engineering."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

*[[Pontonier]]

==Practices and techniques==
Combat engineers are force multipliers and enhance the survival of other troops through the use and practice of camouflage, reconnaissance, communications and other services. These include the construction of roads, bridges, [[field fortification]]s, obstacles and the construction and running of water points . In these roles, combat engineers use a wide variety of hand and power tools. They are also responsible for [[construction rigging]], the use of [[explosive]]s, and the carrying out of demolitions, [[obstacle clearance]], and [[obstacle construction]], [[assault of fortifications]], use of [[assault boat]]s in [[water obstacle crossing]]s, [[helipad]] construction, general construction, [[route reconnaissance]] and road reconnaissance, and erecting [[communication installation]]s. Combat engineers build and run water distribution points, carrying out water filtration, and NBC decontamination when necessary, and storage prior to distribution.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

All these role activities and technologies are divided into several areas of combat engineering:

'''Mobility'''
Improving the ability of one's own force to move around the battlefield. Combat engineers typically support this role through reduction of enemy obstacles which include point and row minefields, anti-tank ditches, wire obstacles, concrete and metal anti-vehicle barriers, and [[Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IED) and wall and [[door breaching]] in urban terrain. Mechanized combat engineer units also have armored vehicles capable of laying short bridges for limited gap-crossing.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
* Clearing terrain obstacles
* Overcoming [[trench]]es and ditches
* Opening routes for [[armored fighting vehicle]]s
* Constructing [[road]]s and [[bridge]]s
* [[Route clearance]]

'''Countermobility'''
Building obstacles to prevent the enemy from moving around the battlefield. Destroying bridges, blocking roads, creating airstrips, digging trenches, etc. Can also include planting [[land mine]]s and [[anti-handling device]]s when authorized and directed to do so.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

When the defender must [[retreat (military)|retreat]] it is often desirable to destroy anything that may be of use to the enemy, particularly bridges, as their destruction can slow the [[Offensive (military)|advance]] of the attackers. The retreating forces may also leave [[booby trap]]s for enemy soldiers, even though these often wreak their havoc upon [[non-combatant]] civilians.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
* Planting land mines
* Digging trenches and ditches
* Demolishing roads and bridges

'''[[Explosive]] material handling'''
The placement of [[land mine]]s to create [[minefield]]s and their maintenance and removal.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
* Clearing fields of [[land mine]]s
* Demolition

[[File:IDF-D9R-Independence-Day-2017-Latrun-IZE-066.jpg|thumb|The [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]] is used for a variety of combat engineering tasks including opening routes and demolishing enemy structures.]]
'''Assault'''
* Opening routes during assault
* Demolishing enemy structures (using [[bulldozer]]s or explosive charges).

'''[[defense (military)|Defense]] structures'''
Building structures which enable one's own [[soldiers]] to survive on the battlefield. Examples include trenches, bunkers, shelters, and armored vehicle fighting positions.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Defensive [[fortification]]s are designed to prevent intrusion into the inner works by [[infantry]]. For minor defensive locations these may only consist of simple walls and ditches. The design principle is to slow down the advance of attackers to where they can be destroyed by defenders from sheltered positions. Most large fortifications are not a single structure but rather a concentric series of fortifications of increasing strength.{{cn|date=June 2018}} 
* Building [[fortification]]s
* Building [[outpost (military)|outpost]]s
* Building fences
* Defense against [[NBC weapon]] threats

==Equipment and vehicles==
Combat engineers employ a wide range of transportation vehicles and equipment, and uses weapons unique to the engineers, including those used in land mine warfare.

Combat engineers are a key role in all armed forces of the world, and invariably found either closely integrated into the force structure, or even into the combat units of the national troops.  In many countries, combat engineers are members of broader military engineering corps or branches. However, some nations have distinct combat engineering corps or branches which are separate from other types of military engineers. The Danish military engineering corps is almost entirely organized into one regiment of combat engineers, simply named [[Ingeniørregimentet]] ("The Engineering Regiment"). During the [[War in Afghanistan]] and the 2003–2011 [[Iraq War]] the US Army tasked its combat engineers with [[route clearance]] missions designed to counter rising threats of [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. To increase the effectiveness of these units EOD and mechanic teams are typically embedded with the combat engineer platoon. Due to rising IED threats US Army sends some combat engineers rank specialist or higher to complete Explosive Ordnance Clearance Agent training to familiarize themselves with types of unexploded ordnance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wood.army.mil/ENGRMAG/PDFs%20for%20Apr-Jun%2005/Clark.pdf|publisher=US Army|title=Explosive Ordnance Clearance Agent}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Historical publications ==
The ''Basic Field Manual, Engineer Soldier's Handbook'', 2 June 1943 (FM 21-105) was written to provide guidance to a new combat engineer in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc28313/m1/ Engineer soldier's handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13312">The [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] of [[lacquerware]] prevents and mitigates deterioration or damage to objects made with [[lacquer]]. The two main types of lacquer are Asian, made with [[sap]] from the [[Urushi]] tree, and European, made with a variety of [[shellac]] and [[Resin|natural resins]]. Lacquer can be damaged by age, light, water, temperature, or damaged substrate.

Conservation treatments include dry cleaning, wet cleaning, consolidation and filling losses. Eastern cultures use Asian lacquer to repair damages and fill and consolidate losses. Western cultures typically use alternate materials that can be reversed with minimal risk to the original object.

== Production and History of Lacquer ==
Lacquer is a type of [[varnish]] or surface coating, which is diluted with [[solvent]] and applied in several coats to seal a substrate, hardening via a [[chemical reaction]] to create a seal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Lacquer|title=Lacquer - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main categories of lacquer: [[Asia]]n lacquer and [[Europe]]an lacquer.

=== Asian Lacquer ===
[[File:Ryukyu Lacquer.jpg|thumb|Ryukyu Lacquer Production, Okinawa, Japan]]
Traditional Asian lacquer has been used for centuries&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/research/pdf/cnsv-lacquer.pdf|title=Bishop Museum Art Conservation Handout: Lacquer|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from [[sap]], prominently that from the Urushi tree; part of the [[sumac]] family grown throughout [[Japan]], [[China]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianart.org/collections/conservation-of-asian-lacquer|title=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Conservation of Asian Lacquer|website=www.asianart.org|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sap from the tree contains a [[chemical compound]] called [[Urushiol|urishol]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;that hardens when exposed to [[humidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Stuart|date=1987-01-01|title=SCIENCE SCOPE: Japanese Urushi: The Finishing Touch|jstor=41731914|journal=Archaeology|volume=40|issue=4|pages=62–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sap is processed to remove [[Impurity|impurities]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lacquer: Technology and conservation: A comprehensive guide to the technology and conservation of Asian and European lacquer.|last=Webb|first=Marianne|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of lacquerware involves a process of applying a ground layer,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-01/the-conservation-of-oriental-lacquer/|title=The Conservation of Oriental Lacquer|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; oftentimes lacquer mixed with other substances such as [[clay]] or a layer of [[Textile|fabric]], followed by many very thin layers of processed lacquer to a substrate, typically [[wood]], and allowing them to dry completely,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; then curing and [[polishing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European Lacquer ===
Developed in the [[17th century|17th Century]], European Lacquerware, or [[Japanning]], was influenced by the import of Asian lacquerware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kisluk-Grosheide|first=Danielle O.|date=1984-01-01|title=A Japanned Cabinet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/1512814|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|volume=19/20|pages=85–95|doi=10.2307/1512814|issn=0077-8958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanned objects are made with a variety of [[shellac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urushi-kobo.com/conservation-restoration.html|title=URUSHI-KOBO in EUROPE - CONSERVATION/ RESTORATION|website=www.urushi-kobo.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and natural [[resin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-52/the-development-of-english-black-japanning-1620-1820/|title=The development of English black japanning 1620-1820|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of Deterioration ==

=== Age ===
When it is produced, lacquer is a very durable substance, both waterproof and [[Solubility|insoluble]]. With age, lacquer can begin to breakdown and deteriorate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[File:Black lacquer box from China, lacquer on wood with silver, 20th century, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|An example of Asian Lacquerware; a 
20th-century Chinese lacquer box.
]]

=== Light ===
Lacquerware is very sensitive to exposure to [[light]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which causes [[photodegradation]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COUEIGNOUX|first=CATHERINE|date=2009-01-01|title=AQUEOUS CLEANING OF PHOTODEGRADED EAST ASIAN LACQUER: A CASE STUDY|jstor=27784652|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=48|issue=1|pages=51–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; fading and discoloration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Water ===
Photodegraded lacquer is extremely sensitive to humidity and [[water]]. Exposure to water and other [[polar solvent]]s can cause blanching, whitening of the surface from the formation of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Temperature ===
High temperatures along with moisture can cause [[Thermochromism|thermochromatic]] change to the lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Marianne|date=1998-01-01|title=Methods and Materials for Filling Losses on Lacquer Objects|jstor=3179915|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=1|pages=117–133|doi=10.2307/3179915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Damage to the Substrate ===
The supporting structure can be damaged or lost from the effects of expanding and contracting in changing [[Collections care|environmental conditions]], including temperature and humidity, from [[Museum integrated pest management|pest]] damage, or deterioration from age. The damaged support may cause warping, lifting or cracking of the lacquer coating.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Previous Restoration ===
Previous restoration such as fills and overpainting can degrade and potentially damage original surfaces over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/treatment-of-mazarin-chest/|title=A Collaborative Approach|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==

=== Preventive Conservation ===
[[Preventive conservation|Preventive Conservation]] measures can be used to avert damage to lacquerware caused by deterioration. Preventive methods may include limiting exposure to light to a maximum of 40 years at 100 [[lux]] or 80 years at 50 lux,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; maintaining stable temperature and humidity levels, using safe and proper art handling with gloves and proper art storage, per current professional [[museum]] standards such as those from the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship|title=Museum Standards and Best Practices - Collections Stewardship|website=www.aam-us.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation Treatment ===
Conservation treatment methods vary depending on the individual object and the materials used in its production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Asian lacquer and European lacquer have different [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], and therefore require different materials and techniques for treatment. Prior to conservation treatment, conservators and conservation scientists analyze and document the properties of the work to determine the best methods and materials for its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lacquers/|title=Characterization of European and Asian Lacquers|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional conservators use codes of ethics for best practices, such as those from the [[American Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.Vx0XxjArI2w|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|website=www.conservation-us.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern and Western Techniques ====
Different conservation techniques are used to conserve Asian lacquerware in Eastern and Western cultures. Traditionally, Eastern cultures use Asian lacquer to repair damages and fill and consolidate losses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Asian lacquer is [[Toxicity|toxic]] and requires training and expertise to use. The material is also not easily [[:wikt:reversibility|reversible]] nor readily available to attain for conservation use. Western cultures, less familiar with the techniques of producing, applying or curing lacquer, typically use alternate materials for conservation treatment, particularly those that can be reversed with minimal risk to the original object.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/aam_phase2/pdf_assets/files/000/000/208/original/Williams_2008_Conservation_of_Asian_Lacquer.pdf?1384300665|title=Conservation of Asian Lacquer Case Studies at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|last=Williams|first=Jane|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Dry Cleaning =====
Dry cleaning is the process of removing dirt and grime from the surface of the object without the use of solvents. Tools used for dry cleaning of lacquerware can include soft brushes, microfiber cloths, cotton swabs, and fine celled absorbent sponges.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Wet Cleaning =====
Wet cleaning is the process of further removal of dirt, grime and residue from the surface of the object that is not successfully removed by dry cleaning. Testing of various solvents should be done prior to wet cleaning the surface of the object in order to prevent possible damage to or removal of the original lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Aqueous solution|Aqueous]] solvents with different [[PH]] levels will have varying levels of success in the removal of dirt and grime from the surface of the lacquer, and have various levels of risk of damaging the surface. This also depends on the condition of the object prior to cleaning. [[Nonpolar solvent|Nonpolar]] solvents are less likely to damage surfaces that have been photodegradad.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Consolidation =====
Consolidation is the process of stabilizing lifting and cracked areas of lacquer to minimize further damage and loss.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Consolidants used can include Asian lacquer or other [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] or organic  [[adhesive]]s such as [[animal glue]] or [[Paraloid B-72]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Adhesives can be thinned with solvents in order to be wicked beneath layers of lifting lacquer or into cracks and allowed to dry while securing the loose area in place.

===== Filling Losses =====
Different types of fill materials are used for European and Asian lacquerware. Losses caused by damage to the lacquer surface can be structural or aesthetic. Losses should only be filled if the surrounding areas are stable, without potential of damage from the fill material. Trained Eastern conservators may choose to use Asian Lacquer as a fill for losses, while Western conservators may use alternate materials such as waxes, polyester resins and epoxy resins. Completed fills can then be inpainted to match the surrounding lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:HK Kwun Tong 麗港公園 Laguna Park Tree evening sunset.JPG|thumb|300px|Tree crown]]
The '''crown''' of a plant refers to the totality of an individual plant's aboveground parts, including [[Plant stem|stems]], [[leaves]], and [[Plant morphology|reproductive structures]]. A [[plant community]] [[Canopy (ecology)|canopy]] consists of one or more plant crowns growing in a given area.

The crown of a [[woody plant]] ([[tree]], [[shrub]], [[liana]]) is the [[branch]]es, [[leaves]], and reproductive structures extending from the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] or main [[Plant stem|stems]].

Shapes of crowns are highly variable. The major types for trees are the '''excurrent branching habit''' resulting in conoid shapes and '''[[decurrent]] (deliquescent) branching habit''', resulting in round shapes. Crowns are also characterized by their width, depth, surface area, volume, and density. Measurements of crowns are important in quantifying and qualifying plant health, growth stage, and efficiency.

Major functions of the crown include light energy assimilation, carbon dioxide absorption and release of oxygen via [[photosynthesis]], energy release by [[Plant respiration|respiration]], and movement of water to the atmosphere by [[transpiration]]. These functions are performed by the leaves. Branches of the crown provide mechanical support to distribute the leaves efficiently and serve as conduits for resources ([[Xylem|water]], [[nutrients]], [[Phloem|photosynthates]]) to perform these functions.

==Crown classes==

Trees can be described as fitting different crown classes. Commonly used are Kraft's classes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/fhm/posters/posters03/kraft_crown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Kraft designated these '''social classes''' based on temperate and boreal forests in [[Central Europe]], so they do not necessarily work with every forest type in the world.
 
Kraft wrote in German so here are his classes with translations:

* 1 v vorherrschend (predominant)
* 2 h herrschend (dominant)
* 3 m mitherrschend (co-dominant)
* 4 b beherrscht (dominated / suppressed)
* 5 u unterständig (inferior) this is then split into 2 subclasses   5a (shade tolerant trees) and 5b (dying crowns / dying trees)

Often it has been simplified to Dominant, Co-dominant and Suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Forests: Elements of Silvology by Roelof A.A. Oldeman, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012, {{ISBN|9783642752131}}, 624pp -pg 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[IUFRO]] developed a tree classification it is based on three components with numbers that then aggregate to give a coded classification thus:&lt;ref&gt;Forests: Elements of Silvology by Roofer A.A. Coleman, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012, {{ISBN|9783642752131}}, 624pp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecological criteria'''

Height component (Stand layer / Height class):

* 100 Overstorey / Overlayer
* 200 Middlestorey / Middlelayer
* 300 Understorey / Underlayer

Vitality component (Tree vigor / vitality):

* 10 Lush
* 20 Normal
* 30 Retarded

Future growth potential component (Developmental tendency / conversion tendency):

* 1 High
* 2 Average
* 3 Lagging

and then additionally

'''Silvicultural Criteria'''

Commercial worth

* 400 Valuable, outstanding tree
* 500 Usable, wood
* 600 Poor to Unusable Quality

Trunk class

* 40 Valuable wood (≥50% of the trunk is high quality timber) 
* 50 Normal wood (≥50% of the trunk is normal quality timber)
* 60 Substandard wood (&lt;50% of the trunk is normal quality timber)

Crown class

*4 Deep crown (&gt;½ the tree length)
*5 Medium crown
*6 Shallow crown (&lt;¼ the tree length)

While both Kraft and IUFRO classifications are aimed at describing individual tree crowns both can an are applied to describe whole '''layers''' or storeys.&lt;ref&gt;National Forest Inventories: Contributions to Forest Biodiversity Assessments Gherardo Chirici, Susanne Winter, Ronald E. McRoberts

'''Cyberwarfare''' is the use or targeting in a [[battlespace]] or [[warfare]] context of [[computer]]s, online [[control system]]s and [[computer network|network]]s.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/triton-malware-dangers-industrial-system-sabotage?CNDID=50121752|title=Menacing Malware Shows the Dangers of Industrial System Sabotage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves both offensive and defensive operations pertaining to the threat of [[cyberattack]]s, espionage and sabotage.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; There has been controversy over whether such operations can be called "war". Nevertheless, powers have been developing cyber capabilities and engaged in cyberwarfare, both offensively and defensively, including the [[United States]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Israel]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Two other notable players are [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/who-are-the-cyberwar-superpowers/|title=Who are the cyberwar superpowers?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
A number of definitions of cyber warfare have been proposed, with no single definition being widely adopted internationally. [[Richard A. Clarke]] defines it as "actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption",.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, Richard A. ''Cyber War'', HarperCollins (2010) {{ISBN|9780061962233}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Martin Libicki defines two types of cyber warfare: strategic and operational, with strategic being "a campaign of cyberattacks one entity carries out on another", whilst operational cyber warfare "involves the use of cyberattacks on the other side’s military in the context of a physical war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Libicki |first=Martin |title=Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar |date=21 October 2009 |ISBN=978-0833047342 |publisher=RAND Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some governments have made it an integral part of their overall military strategy, with some having invested heavily in cyberwarfare capability.&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, William J. III.

This capability uses the same set of penetration testing methodologies but applies them, in the case of United States doctrine, in a strategic way to
* Prevent cyber attacks against critical infrastructure
* Reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks
* Minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks&lt;ref name="Annex 3-12 Cyberspace Ops" /&gt;

Offensive operations are also part of these national level strategies for officially declared wars as well as undeclared secretive operations.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Farwell and Rafael Rohozinski, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396338.2011.555586 Stuxnet and the future of cyber war], Survival, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of threat ==
Cyber warfare can present a multitude of threats towards a nation.  At the most basic level, cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare.  For example, tampering with the operation of air defences via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weinberger |first=Sharon |title=How Israel Spoofed Syria's Air Defense System |publisher=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/10/how-israel-spoo/ |date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from these "hard" threats, cyber warfare can also contribute towards "soft" threats such as espionage and propaganda.

=== Espionage ===
Traditional espionage is not an act of war, nor is cyber-espionage, and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/100425_Laws%20of%20War%20Applicable%20to%20Cyber%20Conflict.pdf "A Note on the Laws of War in Cyberspace"], James A. Lewis, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this assumption, some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations, and are often described as "attacks". For example:

* [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)#Disclosures|Massive spying by the US]] on many countries, revealed by [[Edward Snowden]].
* After the NSA's spying on Germany's Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] was revealed, the Chancellor compared the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayman|first=Noah|title=Merkel Compared NSA To Stasi in Complaint To Obama|url=http://world.time.com/2013/12/18/nsa-leaks-germany-merkel-obama-stasi/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The NSA recording nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas, without the Bahamian government's permission, and similar programs in [[Kenya]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="data pirates"&gt;{{cite web| first1=Ryan |last1=Devereaux |first2=Glenn |last2=Greenwald |first3=Laura |last3=Poitras| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/ |title=Data Pirates of the Caribbean: The NSA Is Recording Every Cell Phone Call in the Bahamas |work=[[The Intercept]] |publisher=[[First Look Media]] |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Schonfeld |title=The Intercept Wouldn't Reveal a Country the U.S. Is Spying On, So WikiLeaks Did Instead |url=http://www.newsweek.com/intercept-wouldnt-reveal-country-us-spying-so-wikileaks-did-instead-252320 |work=Newsweek |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabotage ===
Computers and [[satellites]] that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment. Compromise of military systems, such as [[C4ISTAR]] components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement. Power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption. According to Clarke, the civilian realm is also at risk, noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers, and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid, trains, or the stock market.&lt;ref name=Clark2&gt;[http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/top/2010/09/24-11/Clarke-More-defense-needed-in-cyberspace.html "Clarke: More defense needed in cyberspace"] HometownAnnapolis.com, 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 2010, security experts discovered a malicious software program called [[Stuxnet]] that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world. It is considered "the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies," notes ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/malware-hits-computerized-industrial-equipment/ "Malware Hits Computerized Industrial Equipment"]. ''The New York Times'', 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuxnet]], while extremely effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry, came at a high cost.  For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive.  The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective.  Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences.  Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies.  A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation.  This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage.  In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=P.W. |last2=Friedman |first2=Allan |date=2014 |title=Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=156 |isbn=978-0-19-991809-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denial-of-service attack ====
{{Main|Denial-of-service attack}}
In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, and even root nameservers. DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating. For example, cutting undersea communication cables may severely cripple some regions and countries with regards to their information warfare ability.

==== Electrical power grid ====
The [[federal government of the United States]] admits that the [[electric power transmission|electric power grid]] is susceptible to cyberwarfare.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, Maggie.

The Raw Story (8 April 2009). Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Massive [[power outage]]s caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy, distract from a simultaneous military attack, or create a [[national trauma]].

[[Howard Schmidt]], former Cyber-Security Coordinator of the US, commented on those possibilities:&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar/ "White House Cyber Czar: 'There Is No Cyberwar'"]. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', 4 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's possible that [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s have gotten into administrative computer systems of utility companies, but says those aren't linked to the equipment controlling the grid, at least not in developed countries. [Schmidt] has never heard that the grid itself has been hacked.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 23 December 2015, what is believed to be a first known successful [[Ukraine power grid cyber attack|cyber attack on a power grid]] took place in Ukraine leading to temporary blackouts.&lt;ref name="ty"&gt;{{cite web

=== Propaganda ===
Cyber propaganda is an effort to control information in whatever form it takes, and influence public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39062663|title=Russian military admits significant cyber-war effort|date=21 February 2017|work=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[psychological warfare]], except it uses [[social media]], [[fake news website]]s and other digital means.  In 2018, Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army stated that this kind of attack from actors such as Russia "is a form of system warfare that seeks to de-legitimise the political and social system on which our military strength is based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynamic Security Threats and the British Army |url=https://rusi.org/event/dynamic-security-threats-and-british-army |date=22 January 2018 |publisher=RUSI |last=Carter |first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jowell and O'Donnell (2006) state that "propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist" (p.&amp;nbsp;7). The internet is a phenomenal means of communication. People can get their message across to a huge audience, and with this opens a window for evil. Terrorist organizations can use this medium to brainwash people. It has been suggested that restricted media coverage of terrorist attacks would in turn decrease the number of terrorist attacks that occur afterwards (Cowen 2006).

===Economic disruption===
In 2017, the [[WannaCry ransomware attack|WannaCry]] and [[Petya (malware)|Petya (NotPetya)]] cyber attacks, masquerading as ransomware, caused large-scale disruptions in Ukraine as well as to the U.K.’s Nation Health Service, pharmaceutical giant [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], [[Maersk]] shipping company and other organizations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://tech.newstatesman.com/security/notpetya-global-ransomware-attack-kaspersky-ransomware&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/07/05/how-similar-are-wannacry-and-petya-ransomware/#29ace4b346eb|title=How Similar Are WannaCry And Petya Ransomware?|last=Quora|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/notpetya-ransomware-outbreak-cost-merck-more-than-300m-per-quarter/|title=NotPetya ransomware outbreak cost Merck more than $300M per quarter|work=TechRepublic|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html|title=Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These threats have been recognized as the onset of the fifth generation cyber attacks.

== Motivations ==
=== Military ===
In the U.S., General [[Keith B. Alexander]], first head of [[United States Cyber Command|USCYBERCOM]], told the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] that computer network warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a "mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies. [[Cyber Command]] is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace, outside the traditional battlefields of land, sea, air and space." It will attempt to find and, when necessary, neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command, listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack, including "traditional battlefield prizes – command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/world/15military.html?nl=technology&amp;emc=techupdateema1 "Cyber-War Nominee Sees Gaps in Law"], ''The New York Times'', 14 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One cyber warfare scenario, [[Cyber ShockWave]], which was [[Military simulation|wargame]]d on the cabinet level by former administration officials, raised issues ranging from the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to the [[power grid]] to the limits of statutory authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2010/02/cyber-shockwave-shows-us-unprepared-cyber-threats Cyber ShockWave Shows U.S. Unprepared For Cyber Threats].

The distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party, meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Ragan [http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201007/5245/Report-The-Cyber-ShockWave-and-its-aftermath Report: The Cyber ShockWave event and its aftermath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722190129/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201007/5245/Report-The-Cyber-ShockWave-and-its-aftermath |date=22 July 2011 }}. ''The Tech Herald''. 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide. In 2008, Russia began a cyber attack on the Georgian government website, which was carried out along with Georgian military operations in South Ossetia. In 2008, Chinese 'nationalist [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' attacked CNN as it reported on Chinese repression on Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Andy (1 May 2012).

Jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the military. All four branches of the United States military actively recruit for cyber warfare positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/careers/information-and-technology/cyber-warfare-engineer.html|title=Become a Naval Cyber Warfare Engineer (CWE) : Navy.com|website=www.navy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil ===
Potential targets in internet sabotage include all aspects of the Internet from the [[Internet backbone|backbones]] of the web, to the [[internet service provider]]s, to the varying types of data communication mediums and network equipment. This would include: web servers, enterprise information systems, client server systems, communication links, network equipment, and the desktops and laptops in businesses and homes. [[Electrical grid]]s, financial networks, and [[telecommunication systems]] are also deemed vulnerable, especially due to current trends in computerization and automation.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Financial Weapons of War|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=14 April 2016|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=100|pages=1377–1440|ssrn=2765010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacktivism ===
Politically motivated [[hacktivism]] involves the subversive use of computers and [[computer network]]s to promote an agenda, and can potentially extend to attacks, theft and virtual sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare – or mistaken for it.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, D. E. (2008). [http://faculty.nps.edu/dedennin/publications/Ethics%20of%20Cyber%20Conflict.pdf The ethics of cyber conflict. The Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics]. 407–429.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hacktivists use their knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized access to computer systems they seek to manipulate or damage not for material gain or to cause widespread destruction, but to draw attention to their cause through well-publicized disruptions of select targets. Anonymous and other hacktivist groups are often portrayed in the media as cyber-terrorists, wreaking havoc by hacking websites, posting sensitive information about their victims, and threatening further attacks if their demands are not met. However, hacktivism is more than that. They are politically motivated to change the world, through the use of fundamentalism. Groups like Anonymous have divided opinion with their methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenney|first1=Michael|title=Cyber-Terrorism in a Post-Stuxnet World|journal=Orbis|date=2015|volume=59|issue=1|pages=111–128|doi=10.1016/j.orbis.2014.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Cyber-arms industry|Market for zero-day exploits}}
Computer hacking represents a modern threat in ongoing global conflicts and [[industrial espionage]] and as such is presumed to widely occur.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; It is typical that this type of crime is underreported to the extent they are known. According to McAfee's George Kurtz, corporations around the world face millions of cyberattacks a day. "Most of these [[attack (computing)|attacks]] don't gain any media attention or lead to strong political statements by victims."&lt;ref name=McAfee&gt;[http://siblog.mcafee.com/cto/google-attack-is-tip-of-iceberg/ "Google Attack Is Tip Of Iceberg"], McAfee Security Insights, 13 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This type of crime is usually financially motivated.

But not all examinations with the issue of cyberwarfare are achieving profit or personal gain. There are still institutes and companies like the [[University of Cincinnati]] or the [[Kaspersky Security Lab]] which are trying to increase the sensibility of this topic by researching and publishing of new security threats.

A 2008 article in the ''Culture Mandala: The Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies'' by Jason Fritz alleges that the Chinese government from 1995 to 2008 was involved in a number of high-profile cases of espionage, primarily through the use of a "decentralized network of students, business people, scientists, diplomats, and engineers from within the Chinese Diaspora".&lt;ref name="epublications.bond.edu.au"/&gt; A defector in Belgium, purportedly an agent, claimed that there were hundreds of spies in industries throughout Europe, and on his defection to Australia Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin said there were over 1,000 such in that country.

While China continues to be held responsible for a string of cyber-attacks on a number of public and private institutions in the United States, India, Russia, Canada, and France, the Chinese government denies any involvement in cyber-spying campaigns. The administration maintains the position that China is not the threat but rather the victim of an increasing number of cyber-attacks.

In response to reports of cyberattacks by China against the United States, [[Amitai Etzioni]] of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that China and the United States agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps; it would also entail vetting these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai (September 20, 2013).

[[Operation Shady RAT]] is an ongoing series of [[cyber attack]]s starting mid-2006, reported by Internet security company [[McAfee]] in August 2011.

{{see also|National Cyber Security Policy 2013}}
The Department of Information Technology created the [[Indian Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT-In) in 2004 to thwart cyber attacks in India.&lt;ref name="businesstoday.intoday.in"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/india-cyber-security-at-risk/1/191786.html |title= Beware of the bugs: Can cyber attacks on India's critical infrastructure be thwarted? |work= BusinessToday |accessdate= January 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, there were 23 reported cyber security breaches. In 2011, there were 13,301. That year, the government created a new subdivision, the [[National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre]] (NCIIPC) to thwart attacks against energy, transport, banking, telecom, defence, space and other sensitive areas.

The Executive Director of the [[Nuclear Power Corporation of India]] (NPCIL) stated in February 2013 that his company alone was forced to block up to ten targeted attacks a day. CERT-In was left to protect less critical sectors.

A high-profile cyber attack on 12 July 2012 breached the email accounts of about 12,000 people, including those of officials from the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]], [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO), and the [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP).&lt;ref name="businesstoday.intoday.in" /&gt; A government-private sector plan being overseen by [[National Security Advisor (India)|National Security Advisor]] (NSA) [[Shivshankar Menon]] began in October 2012, and intends to beef up India's cyber security capabilities in the light of a group of experts findings that India faces a 470,000 shortfall of such experts despite the country's reputation of being an IT and software powerhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-16/india/34498075_1_cyber-security-cyber-attacks-cyber-warfare|title=5 lakh cyber warriors to bolster India's e-defence|date=16 October 2012|work=The Times of India|location=India|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Information Technology Secretary J. Satyanarayana stated that the [[National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre|NCIIPC]]{{page needed|date=November 2013}} was finalizing policies related to national cyber security that would focus on domestic security solutions, reducing exposure through foreign technology.&lt;ref name="businesstoday.intoday.in" /&gt; Other steps include the isolation of various security agencies to ensure that a synchronised attack could not succeed on all fronts and the planned appointment of a National Cyber Security Coordinator. As of that month, there had been no significant economic or physical damage to India related to cyber attacks.

On 26 November 2010, a group calling itself the Indian Cyber Army hacked the websites belonging to the Pakistan Army and the others belong to different ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Pakistan Computer Bureau, Council of Islamic Ideology, etc. The attack was done as a revenge for the [[Mumbai terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/83967/36-government-websites-hacked-by-indian-cyber-army/ "36 government sites hacked by 'Indian Cyber Army'"].

The Chinese are being blamed after a cybersecurity company, F-Secure Labs, found a malware, NanHaiShu, which targeted the Philippines Department of Justice. It sent information in an infected machine to a server with a Chinese IP address.

When Russia was still a part of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1982, a portion of its [[Trans-Siberian Pipeline|Trans-Siberia pipeline]] within its territory exploded, allegedly due to computer malware implanted in the pirated Canadian software by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. The malware caused the SCADA system running the pipeline to malfunction. The "Farewell Dossier" provided information on this attack, and wrote that compromised computer chips would become a part of Soviet military equipment, flawed turbines would be placed in the gas pipeline, and defective plans would disrupt the output of chemical plants and a tractor factor. This caused the "most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space." However, the Soviet Union did not blame the United States for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Cyber War|last=Mazanec|first=Brain M.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2015|isbn=9781612347639|location=USA|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the South Korean company [[SK Communications]] was hacked, resulting in the theft of the personal details (including names, phone numbers, home and email addresses and resident registration numbers) of up to 35 million people. A trojaned software update was used to gain access to the SK Communications network.

With ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of Korea)|South Korea's defense ministry]] stated that South Korea was going to improve cyber-defense strategies in hopes of preparing itself from possible cyber attacks. In March 2013, South Korea's major banks – Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank and NongHyup Bank – as well as many broadcasting stations – KBS, YTN and MBC – were hacked and more than 30,000 computers were affected; it is one of the biggest attacks South Korea has faced in years.&lt;ref name="Global Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130320/south-korea-police-investigating-server-outages-at-major-tv-net|title=South Korea raises alert after hackers attack broadcasters, banks|last=Lee|first=Se Young|work=Global Post|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it remains uncertain as to who was involved in this incident, there has been immediate assertions that North Korea is connected, as it threatened to attack South Korea's government institutions, major national banks and traditional newspapers numerous times – in reaction to the sanctions it received from nuclear testing and to the continuation of [[Foal Eagle]], South Korea's annual joint military exercise with the United States. North Korea's cyber warfare capabilities raise the alarm for South Korea, as North Korea is increasing its manpower through military academies specializing in hacking. Current figures state that South Korea only has 400 units of specialized personnel, while North Korea has more than 3,000 highly trained hackers; this portrays a huge gap in cyber warfare capabilities and sends a message to South Korea that it has to step up and strengthen its Cyber Warfare Command forces. Therefore, in order to be prepared from future attacks, South Korea and the United States will discuss further about deterrence plans at the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM). At SCM, they plan on developing strategies that focuses on accelerating the deployment of ballistic missiles as well as fostering its defense shield program, known as the Korean Air and Missile Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/04/01/20/0301000000AEN20130401004000315F.HTML|title=S.

They distributed an infected version of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]] whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|D-30 Howitzer]] artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the [[X Agent (spyware)|X-Agent]] spyware and posted online on military forums. The attack was claimed by CrowdStrike to be successful, with more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers destroyed, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the [[Ukrainian Armed Forces]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraines-military-denies-russian-hack-attack-143419289.html Ukraine's military denies Russian hack attack] , [[Yahoo!

The Snake tool kit began spreading into Ukrainian computer systems in 2010. It performed Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), as well as highly sophisticated Computer Network Attacks (CNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Cyber War|last=Mazanec|first=Brain M.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2015|isbn=9781612347639|location=USA|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] has been both victim and predator of several cyberwarfare operations. Iran is considered an emerging [[Great power|military power]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashcritic.com/irans-military-preparing-for-cyber-warfare/|title=  Iran's military is preparing for cyber warfare |publisher=Flash//CRITIC Cyber Threat News|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, [[Iran]] was attacked by the [[Stuxnet]] worm, thought to specifically target its [[Nuclear program of Iran|Natanz nuclear enrichment facility.]] It was a 500-kilobyte computer worm that infected at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including the Natanz uranium-enrichment plant. Although the official authors of Stuxnet haven’t been officially identified, Stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the United States and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denning|first=Dorothy E.|date=2012-07-16|title=Stuxnet: What Has Changed?|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/3/672|journal=Future Internet|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=672–687|doi=10.3390/fi4030672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worm is said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare.&lt;ref&gt;AFP (1 October 2010).

==== Israel ====
In the 2006 war against [[Hezbollah]], Israel alleges that cyber-warfare was part of the conflict, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) intelligence estimates several countries in the Middle East used Russian hackers and scientists to operate on their behalf. As a result, Israel attached growing importance to cyber-tactics, and became, along with the U.S., France and a couple of other nations, involved in cyber-war planning. Many international high-tech companies are now locating research and development operations in Israel, where local hires are often veterans of the IDF's elite computer units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,210486,00.html "Israel Adds Cyber-Attack to IDF"], Military.com, 10 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A.

Following US President [[Donald Trump]]'s decision to pull out of the [[Iran nuclear deal]] in May 2018, cyber warfare units in the United States and Israel monitoring internet traffic out of Iran noted a surge in retaliatory cyber attacks from Iran. sSecurity firms warned that Iranian hackers were sending emails containing malware to diplomats who work in the foreign affairs offices of US allies and employees at telecommunications companies, trying to infiltrate their computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/without-the-nuclear-deal-iranian-cyber-attacks-resume-20180512-p4zewk.html Without the nuclear deal, Iranian cyber attacks resume]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
On August 15, 2012 at 11:08 am local time, the [[Shamoon]] virus began destroying over 35,000 computer systems, rendering them inoperable. The virus used to target the [[Saudi]] government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company [[Saudi Aramco]]. The attackers posted a pastie on PasteBin.com hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |id= Cutting Sword of Justice |title= Pastie: 'Untitled' |url= https://pastebin.com/HqAgaQRj |accessdate=3 November 2017 |date= 15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pastie Cutting Sword of Justice.png |thumb|Pastie announcing attack against Saudi Aramco by a group called Cutting Sword of Justice]] The attack was well staged according to [[Chris Kubecka]], a former security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jose Pagliery:The inside story of the biggest hack in history |url= http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/05/technology/aramco-hack/index.html |date=5 August 2015 |accessdate= 19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an unnamed Saudi Aramco employee on the Information Technology team which opened a malicious phishing email, allowing initial entry into the computer network around mid-2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chris Kubecka: How to Implement IT Security after a Cyber Meltdown |date= 29 December 2015 |id= Accessed 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable. 
[[File:Petrol truck shipments halted during Shamoon attacks on 1 September 2012.png|thumb|Tanker trucks unable to be loaded with gasoline due to Shamoon attacks]]

On August 29, 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for the CEO Khalid Al- Falih&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pastebin.com/AtN7dLeW |title= Saudi Aramco hug, another one |date= 29 August 2012 |accessdate= 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie.

According to Kubecka, in order to restore operations. Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By September 1, 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the August 15th attack. [[RasGas]] was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Youtube - Chris Kubecka: How to Implement IT Security after a Cyber Meltdown |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyMobr_TDSI |date= 3 August 2015 |accessdate= 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times''. 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cyberwarfare was, for the first time, considered a larger threat than [[Al Qaeda]] or terrorism, by many U.S. intelligence officials.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Dilanian, Ken.

U.S. government security expert [[Richard A. Clarke]], in his book ''Cyber War'' (May 2010), defines "cyberwarfare" as "actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|6}} ''The Economist'' describes [[cyberspace]] as "the fifth domain of warfare,"&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16481504?story_id=16481504&amp;source=features_box1 "Cyberwar: War in the Fifth Domain"] ''Economist'', 1 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William J.

[which] has become just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space."&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;

In 2009, president Barack Obama declared America's digital infrastructure to be a "strategic national asset," and in May 2010 the Pentagon set up its new U.S. Cyber Command ([[United States Cyber Command|USCYBERCOM]]), headed by General [[Keith B. Alexander]], director of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), to defend American military networks and attack other countries' systems. The EU has set up [[ENISA]] (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security) which is headed by Prof. Udo Helmbrecht and there are now further plans to significantly expand ENISA's capabilities. The United Kingdom has also set up a cyber-security and "operations centre" based in [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the British equivalent of the NSA. In the U.S. however, Cyber Command is only set up to protect the military, whereas the government and corporate infrastructures are primarily the responsibility respectively of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and private companies.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

In February 2010, top American lawmakers warned that the "threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and computer networks was sharply on the rise."&lt;ref name=Lipman/&gt; According to The Lipman Report, numerous key sectors of the U.S. economy along with that of other nations, are currently at risk, including cyber threats to public and private facilities, banking and finance, transportation, manufacturing, medical, education and government, all of which are now dependent on computers for daily operations.&lt;ref name=Lipman&gt;[http://www.guardsmark.com/library/computer_security.asp?nav=4&amp;subnav=1 The Lipman Report], 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, president Obama stated that "cyber intruders have probed our electrical grids."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Richard.

''The Economist'' writes that China has plans of "winning informationised wars by the mid-21st century". They note that other countries are likewise organizing for cyberwar, among them Russia, Israel and North Korea. Iran boasts of having the world's second-largest cyber-army.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; James Gosler, a government cybersecurity specialist, worries that the U.S. has a severe shortage of [[computer security]] specialists, estimating that there are only about 1,000 qualified people in the country today, but needs a force of 20,000 to 30,000 skilled experts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128574055 "Cyberwarrior Shortage Threatens U.S. Security"].

In January 2012, [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]], the former director of national intelligence at the [[National Security Agency]] under president [[George W.

In August 2010, the U.S. for the first time warned publicly about the Chinese military's use of civilian computer experts in clandestine cyber attacks aimed at American companies and government agencies. The Pentagon also pointed to an alleged China-based computer spying network dubbed [[GhostNet]] that was revealed in a research report last year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/2010_CMPR_Final.pdf ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2010].

The [[United States Department of Defense]] sees the use of computers and the Internet to conduct warfare in [[cyberspace]] as a threat to national security. The [[United States Joint Forces Command]] describes some of its attributes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cyberspace technology is emerging as an "instrument of power" in societies, and is becoming more available to a country's opponents, who may use it to attack, degrade, and disrupt communications and the flow of information. With low barriers to entry, coupled with the anonymous nature of activities in cyberspace, the list of potential adversaries is broad.  Furthermore, the globe-spanning range of cyberspace and its disregard for national borders will challenge legal systems and complicate a nation's ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies.&lt;ref name=JOE/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2010, the [[United States Joint Forces Command]] released a study which included a summary of the threats posed by the internet:&lt;ref name=JOE&gt;[http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2010/JOE_2010_o.pdf "The Joint Operating Environment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810043238/http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2010/JOE_2010_o.pdf |date=10 August 2013 }}, Joint Forces Command, 18 February 2010, pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With very little investment, and cloaked in a veil of anonymity, our adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our national interests. Cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts. Enemies in cyberspace will include both states and non-states and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers. Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication. Indeed, adversaries have already taken advantage of computer networks and the power of information technology not only to plan and execute savage acts of terrorism, but also to influence directly the perceptions and will of the U.S. Government and the American population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the hardest issues in cyber counterintelligence is the problem of attribution. Unlike conventional warfare, figuring out who is behind an attack can be very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, John.

== Controversy over terms ==
There is debate on whether the term "cyberwarfare" is accurate.

[[Eugene Kaspersky]], founder of [[Kaspersky Lab]], concludes that "[[cyberterrorism]]" is a more accurate term than "cyberwar". He states that "with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism."&lt;ref name=Kaspersky1&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/experts-we-lost-the-cyber-war-now-were-in-the-era-of-cyber-terror/ "Latest viruses could mean 'end of world as we know it,' says man who discovered Flame"], ''The Times of Israel'', 6 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He also equates large-scale [[cyber weapon]]s, such as [[Flame (malware)|Flame]] and [[NetTraveler]] which his company discovered, to [[biological weapons]], claiming that in an interconnected world, they have the potential to be equally destructive.&lt;ref name=Kaspersky1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaspersky2&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-cyber-bug-targeting-middle-east-but-israel-untouched-so-far/ "Cyber espionage bug attacking Middle East, but Israel untouched — so far"], ''The Times of Israel'', 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 the ''[[Journal of Strategic Studies]]'', a leading journal in that field, published an article by [[Thomas Rid]], "Cyber War Will Not Take Place" which argued that all politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of sabotage, espionage, or subversion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rid|first=Thomas|title=Cyber War Will Not Take Place|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|date=October 2011|doi=10.1080/01402390.2011.608939|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2011.608939|accessdate=21 October 2011|volume=35|pages=5–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future.

[[Howard Schmidt]], an American cybersecurity expert, argued in March 2010 that "there is no cyberwar... I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment."&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

Other experts, however, believe that this type of activity already constitutes a war. The warfare analogy is often seen intended to motivate a militaristic response when that is not necessarily appropriate. Ron Deibert, of Canada's Citizen Lab, has warned of a "militarization of cyberspace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deibert|first=Ron|title=Tracking the emerging arms race in cyberspace|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|year=2011|volume=67|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0096340210393703|url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/1/1|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European cybersecurity expert Sandro Gaycken argued for a middle position. He considers cyberwar from a legal perspective an unlikely scenario, due to the reasons lined out by Rid (and, before him, Sommer),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Peter|title=Reducing Systemic Cybersecurity Risk|journal=OECD Multi-Displinary Issues|date=January 2011|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/3/42/46894657.pdf|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the situation looks different from a strategic point of view. States have to consider military-led cyber operations an attractive activity, within and without war, as they offer a large variety of cheap and risk-free options to weaken other countries and strengthen their own positions. Considered from a long-term, geostrategic perspective, cyber offensive operations can cripple whole economies, change political views, agitate conflicts within or among states, reduce their military efficiency and equalize the capacities of high-tech nations to that of low-tech nations, and use access to their critical infrastructures to blackmail them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaycken|first=Sandro|title=Cyberwar – Das Internet als Kriegsschauplatz|year=2010|url=https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&amp;backPID=178&amp;tt_products=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/08/elections-in-ghana-marred-by-hacked-website-and-calls-for-the-president-to-concede/--&gt;

Oxford academic Lucas Kello proposed a new term – "unpeace" – to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose non-violent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war. Such actions are neither warlike nor peacelike. Although they are non-violent, and thus not acts of war, their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than even some armed attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kello |first=Lucas |date=2017 |title=The Virtual Weapon and International Order |location=New Haven, Conn. |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=77–79 |isbn=9780300220230 |url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300220230/virtual-weapon-and-international-order}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Politics of Cyberspace: Grasping the Danger |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21727048-academia-still-grappling-problems-beset-computers-and-networks |magazine=The Economist |location=London |publisher= |date=26 August 2017 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
Various parties have attempted to come up with international legal frameworks to clarify what is and is not acceptable, but none have yet been widely accepted.

The [[Tallinn Manual]], published in 2013, is an academic, non-binding study on how international law, in particular the [[jus ad bellum]] and [[international humanitarian law]], apply to cyber conflicts and [[cyber warfare]]. It was written at the invitation of the [[Tallinn]]-based [[NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence]] by an international group of approximately twenty experts between 2009 and 2012.

The [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (members of which include China and Russia) defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information "harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states". In September 2011, these countries proposed to the UN Secretary General a document called "International code of conduct for information security".&lt;ref&gt;Russian Embassy to the UK [http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/49]. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the United States' approach focuses on physical and economic damage and injury, putting political concerns under [[freedom of speech]]. This difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the West to pursue global cyber arms control agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130052701 | title=Seeing The Internet As An 'Information Weapon' | publisher=NPR | author= Tom Gjelten | date=23 September 2010 | accessdate=23 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, American General [[Keith B. Alexander]] did endorse talks with Russia over a proposal to limit military attacks in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Siobhan. (4 June 2010) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703340904575284964215965730?KEYWORDS=cybersecurity WSJ: U.S. Backs Talks on Cyber Warfare]. ''The Wall Street Journal''. Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, [[Barack Obama]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] agreed to install a secure ''Cyberwar-Hotline'' providing "a direct secure voice communications line between the US cybersecurity coordinator and the Russian deputy secretary of the security council, should there be a need to directly manage a crisis situation arising from an [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] security incident" (White House quote).&lt;ref name="arshotline"&gt;Sean Gallagher, [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/us-russia-to-install-cyber-hotline-to-prevent-accidental-cyberwar/ ''US, Russia to install "cyber-hotline" to prevent accidental cyberwar''], Arstechnica, 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A Ukrainian professor of International Law, Alexander Merezhko, has developed a project called the International Convention on Prohibition of Cyberwar in Internet. According to this project, cyberwar is defined as the use of Internet and related technological means by one state against the political, economic, technological and information sovereignty and independence of another state. Professor Merezhko's project suggests that the Internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark. He states that the Internet (cyberspace) is a "common heritage of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politik.org.ua/vid/publcontent.php3?y=7&amp;p=57 Український центр політичного менеджменту – Зміст публікації – Конвенция о запрещении использования кибервойны] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007185753/http://www.politik.org.ua/vid/publcontent.php3?y=7&amp;p=57 |date=7 October 2011 }}. Politik.org.ua. Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 2017 [[RSA Conference]] [[Microsoft]] president Brad Smith suggested global rules – a "Digital Geneva Convention" – for cyber attacks that "ban the nation-state hacking of all the civilian aspects of our economic and political infrastructures". He also stated that an independent organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nation-state attacks to specific countries. Furthermore, he said that the technology sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect Internet users and pledge to [[corporate warfare|remain neutral in conflict]] and not aid governments in offensive activity and to adopt a coordinated disclosure process for software and hardware vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Digital Geneva Convention' needed to deter nation-state hacking: Microsoft president|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-cyber-idUSKBN15T26V|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=20 February 2017|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaspersky|first1=Eugene|title=A Digital Geneva Convention?

[[File:Wiki-dstyle.png|thumb|A doggy style position]]
'''Doggy style''', also spelled '''doggie style''', is a [[sex position]] in which a person bends over, crouches on all fours (usually on hands and knees), or lies on their abdomen, for [[sexual intercourse]], other forms of [[sexual penetration]] or other [[sexual activity]]. Doggy style is a form of a '''rear-entry position''', others being with the receiving partner lying on the side in the [[spoons sex position]]&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nilamadhab Kar |author2=Gopal Chandra Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=110–111| isbn = 8180614050|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA110 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140627173823/http://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA110 | archive-date =June 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Reverse cowgirl (sex position)|reverse cowgirl sex position]].  [[Non-penetrative sex]] in this position may also be regarded as doggy style.

Either partner may be the dominant partner or the [[Dominance and submission|submissive]] partner.&lt;ref name=Comfort /&gt; The passive partner is open to a variety of additional sexual activities, with the active partner being able to penetrate the [[vagina]], the [[Human anus|anus]] during [[anal sex]], or being in a position to perform [[oral sex]] ([[cunnilingus]], [[fellatio]] or [[anilingus]]).

In [[ancient Rome]], this practice was known as '''''coitus more ferarum''''', Latin for "sexual intercourse in the manner of wild beasts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J.

It is described in the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' as the ''cow position'' or ''the congress of a cow'',&lt;ref name="kama"&gt;''The [[Kama Sutra]]'', as given at {{cite book|url=http://www.kamasutra-sex.org/text/|title=The Kama Sutra of Vatsayayana|year=1883|publisher=Kamasutra-sex.org|chapter=CHAPTER VI|chapterurl=http://www.kamasutra-sex.org/text/kama206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is listed in ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;{{cite book|pages=38–41|title=The Perfumed Garden|isbn=0892814438|publisher=Park Street Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The posture adopted by the receiving partner resembles [[lordosis behavior]] &amp;ndash; a physical posture seen in many [[female mammals]], often when they are ready for sex/mating, the primary characteristic of which is a ventral arching of the spine. During vaginal penetration from behind, the penis may penetrate deeper into the vagina, reaching preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaching the [[vaginal fornix|posterior fornix]]; while in the [[missionary position]], it is in preferential contact with the [[anterior]] wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis can reach the [[Anterior fornix erogenous zone|anterior fornix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of Sexual Intercourse: Second Experience in Missionary Position and Initial Experience in Posterior Position |journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy |volume=28 |pages=63–76 |doi=10.1080/00926230252851203 |year=2002 |author1=A.

The active partner may also massage or stimulate the receiving partner's [[erogenous zone]]s, such as the genitals, [[stimulation of nipples|nipples]], buttocks, or administer a [[erotic spanking|playful spank]] to the buttocks,&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Rogiere&gt;Rogiere, Jean, ''The Little Book of Sex''.

Confirming its popularity, in 2015 a poll of 2,157 British men and women found that regionally, doggy style was favored by the Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The UK's 'favourite sex positions' revealed in new survey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/the-uks-favourite-sex-positions-revealed-in-new-survey-10038133.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Doggy style is a less physically demanding sex position and may be a preferred sex position if either partner has back issues or some other medical conditions. During doggy style, the scrotum sometimes provides friction to the clitoris, thus possibly producing an orgasm or sexual stimulation in the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, Erick, Nicole Prause, and James H.

Doggy style has advantages and disadvantages. In a doggy style position, a woman may feel vulnerable, which some women find arousing in itself; while others consider doggy style unromantic.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; For some women, doggy style offers stimulation of an area that may be termed "the [[G-spot]]". However, this position may offer only minimal stimulation of the [[clitoris]], so some women may require manual stimulation to achieve orgasm. Some men may, however, be able to stimulate the clitoris simultaneously with the penis and the [[scrotum]] respectively during doggy style.&lt;ref name="Human Reproductive Biology"/&gt;

The position is considered by some to be less intimate because [[eye contact]] and [[kiss]]ing are more difficult. According to the book ''Sexual Pleasure'' by Barbara Keesling, many established couples find doggy style relationship-affirming, as it requires and implies a level of trust and a surrender of control by the receiving to the active partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal &amp; Intimacy |last=Keesling |first=Barbara |year=1993 |publisher=[[Hunter House Publishers]] |location= |isbn=978-0-89793-148-9 |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a theme in art==
Doggy style has been known in most cultures in all times, and has been depicted in art:

'''Dubna''' ({{lang-rus|Дубна́|p=dʊbˈna}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|town]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]]. It has a status of ''[[naukograd]]'' (i.e. town of science), being home to the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], an international [[nuclear physics]] research center and one of the largest scientific foundations in the country. It is also home to [[MKB Raduga]], a defense aerospace company specializing in design and production of missile systems. The modern town was developed in the middle of the 20th century and town status was granted to it in 1956. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=70,663|p2002=60,951|p1989=65,805}}

==Geography==
The town is {{convert|120|m|sp=us}} above [[sea level]], situated approximately {{convert|125|km|sp=us}} north of [[Moscow]], on the [[Volga River]], just downstream the [[Ivankovo Reservoir]]. The reservoir is formed by a hydroelectric [[dam]] across the Volga situated within the town borders. The town lies on both banks of the Volga, and the dam serves as the only bridge. The western boundary of the town is defined by the [[Moscow Canal]] joining the Volga, while the eastern boundary is defined by [[Dubna River (Volga basin)|Dubna River]] joining the Volga.

Dubna is the northernmost town of Moscow Oblast.

==History==

===Pre-World War II===
Fortress Dubna ({{lang-ru|Дубна}}) belonging to [[Rostov-Suzdal Principality]] was built in the area in 1132 by the order of [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] and existed until 1216. The fortress was destroyed during the feudal war between the sons of [[Vsevolod the Big Nest]]. The village of Gorodishche ({{lang|ru|Городище}}) was located on the right bank of the Volga River and was a part of the [[Kashin Principality]]. Dubna customs post ({{lang|ru|Дубненское мыто)}} was located in the area and was a part of the [[Tver#Grand princedom|Principality of Tver]].

Before the [[October Revolution]], few villages were in the area: Podberezye was on the left bank of the Volga, and Gorodishche, Alexandrovka, Ivankovo, Yurkino, and Kozlaki ({{lang-ru|Козлаки}}) were on the right bank.

Right after the Revolution one of the first [[collective farm]]s was organized in Dubna area.

In 1931, the [[Orgburo]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] made a decision to build the [[Moscow Canal|Volga-Moscow Canal]]. [[Genrikh Yagoda]], then the leader of the [[State Political Directorate]], was put in charge of construction. The Canal was completed in 1937. [[Ivankovo Reservoir]] and [[Ivankovo hydroelectrical plant]] were also created as a part of the project. Many villages and the town [[Korcheva]] were submerged under water. Dubna is mentioned in [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' as the town built by Gulag prisoners.

===Science===
{{See also|Joint Institute for Nuclear Research}}

The decision to build a [[proton accelerator]] for nuclear research was taken by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government in 1946. An impracticable place where the current town is situated was chosen due to remoteness from Moscow and the presence of the [[Ivankovo Reservoir|Ivankovo power plant]] nearby. The scientific leader was [[Igor Kurchatov]]. The general supervisor of the project including construction of a settlement, a road and a railway connecting it to Moscow (largely involving [[penal labour]] of [[Gulag]] inmates) was the [[NKVD]] chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]]. After three years of intensive work, the accelerator was commissioned on December 13, 1949.

The town of Dubna was officially inaugurated in 1956, together with the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR), which has developed into a large international research laboratory involved mainly in [[particle physics]], [[heavy ion]] physics, synthesis of [[transuranium element]]s, and [[radiobiology]]. In 1960 a town of Ivankovo situated on the opposite (left) bank of the Volga was merged into Dubna. In 1964, Dubna hosted the prestigious [[International Conference on High Energy Physics]].

Outstanding physicists of the 20th century including [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], [[Georgy Flyorov]], [[Vladimir Veksler]], [[Bruno Pontecorvo]] used to work at the institute. A number of elementary particles and [[transuranium element|transuranium nuclei]] (most recently, the [[Tennessine|117th element]]) have been discovered and investigated there, leading to the honorary naming of [[chemical element]] 105 [[dubnium]] ('''Db''') for the town.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated as '''Dubna [[City of federal subject significance|Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Moscow Oblast|districts]].&lt;ref name="Ref1406"&gt;Law #11/2013-OZ&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Dubna Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Dubna Urban Okrug'''.&lt;ref name="Ref777"&gt;Law #84/2005-OZ&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

==Economics==
Before the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], [[JINR]] and [[MKB Raduga]] were the main employers in the town. Since then their role has decreased significantly. Several small industrial enterprises have emerged, however the town still experiences some employment difficulties. Proximity to [[Moscow]] allows many to commute and work there. Plans by [[Sistema|AFK Sistema]] and other investors including government structures have been announced to build a Russian analogue of [[Silicon Valley]] in Dubna. As of the beginning of 2007, nothing has commenced.

===Transport===

'''Emotion-sensitive software''' (ESS) is software specifically designed to target and monitor emotional response in a human being. Some [[software]] measures anger by comparing the pitch of a voice to a regular, or calm, [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Another approach is the measurement of physical appearance. If a [[camera]] or similar recording device picks up a certain amount of red [[pigmentation]] in the [[skin]] the system can be alerted that this person is angered.

However, many producers of ESS do not reveal the secrets of how the software works. This increases competition between companies and stops people from attempting to avoid the system by masking these tendencies.

One application of ESS was developed by University of Notre Dame Assistant Professor of Psychology Sidney D'Mello, Art Graesser from the University of Memphis and a colleague from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They used the technology to create an electronic tutor that could assess a student's level of boredom and frustration based on facial expression and body language, and react accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=University of Notre Dame|title=New Computers Respond to Students' Emotions, Boredom|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120302132546.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bab al Nasr, Fatimid Cairo.jpg|thumb|Bab al-Futuh gate built by Fatimid vazir [[Badr al-Jamali]]]]
'''Fatimid art''' refers to Islamic artifacts and architecture from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (909-1171), principally in [[Egypt]] and [[North Africa]]. The Fatimid Caliphate was initially established in the [[Maghreb]], with its roots in a ninth-century [[Shia]] [[Ismailism|Ismailist]] religious movement originating in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].  Many monuments survive in the Fatimid cities founded in North Africa, starting with [[Mahdia]], on the [[Tunisia]]n coast, the principal city prior to the conquest of Egypt in 969 and the building of  ''al-Qahira'', the "City Victorious", now part of modern-day [[Cairo]]. The period was marked by a prosperity amongst the upper echelons, manifested in the creation of opulent and finely wrought objects in the decorative arts, including carved [[rock crystal]], [[lustreware]] and other [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood carving|wood]] and [[ivory carving]], [[gold jewelry]] and other [[metalware]], textiles, books and coinage.  These items not only reflected personal wealth, but were used as gifts to curry favour abroad. The most precious and valuable objects were amassed in the caliphal palaces in al-Qahira. In the 1060s, following several years of drought during which the armies received no payment, the palaces were systematically looted, the libraries largely destroyed, precious gold objects melted down, with a few of the treasures dispersed across the medieval Christian world. Afterwards Fatimid artifacts continued to be made in the same style, but were adapted to a larger populace using less precious materials. 
{{cquote|In 1067-68 the great treasury of the Fatimids was ransacked when the troops rebelled and demanded to be paid. The stories of this plundering mention not only great quantities of pearls and jewels, crowns, swords, and other imperial accoutrements but also many objects in rare materials and of enormous size. Eighteen thousand pieces of rock crystal and cut glass were swiftly looted from the palace, and twice as many jewelled objects; also large numbers of gold and silver knives all richly set with jewels; valuable chess and backgammon pieces; various types of hand mirrors, skilfully decorated; six thousand perfume bottles in gilded silver; and so on. More specifically, we learn of enormous pieces of rock crystal inscribed with caliphal names; of gold animals encrusted with jewels and enamels; of a large golden palm tree; and even of a whole garden partially gilded and decorated with niello.  There was also an immensely rich treasury of furniture, carpets, curtains, and wall coverings, many embroidered in gold, often with designs incorporating birds and quadrupeds, kings and their notables, and even a whole range of geographical vistas.Relatively few of these objects have survived, most of them very small; but the finest are impressive enough to lend substance to the vivid picture painted in the historical accounts of this vanished world of luxury. |4={{harvtxt|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001}}}}

==Rock crystal ewers==
Rock crystal ewers are pitchers carved from a single block of [[Quartz|rock crystal]]. They were made by Islamic [[Fatimid]] artisans and are considered to be amongst the rarest objects in [[Islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few that survived and are now in collections across Europe. They are often in cathedral treasuries, where they were rededicated after being captured from their original Islamic settings. Made in Egypt in the late 10th century, the ewer pictured is exquisitely decorated with fantastic birds, beasts and twisting tendrils. The Treasure of Caliph Mostansir-Billah at [[Cairo]], which was destroyed in 1062, apparently contained 1800 rock crystal vessels.

Great skill was required to hollow out the raw rock crystal without breaking it and to carve the delicate, often very shallow, decoration.

==Fatimid architecture==
{{main article|Fatimid architecture}}
In architecture, the [[Fatimid]]s followed [[Tulunid]] techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In [[Cairo]], their first congregational mosque was [[al-Azhar mosque]] ("the splendid") founded along with the city (969–973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning ([[al-Azhar University]]), became the spiritual center for [[Ismaili|Ismaili Shia]]. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996–1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in [[Fatimid]] ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the [[Aqmar Mosque]] (1125)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA72 Doris Behrens-Abouseif (1992), ''Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction'', BRILL, p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's [[Defensive wall|city walls]] commissioned by the powerful [[Fatimid]] [[emir]] and [[vizier]] [[Badr al-Jamali]] (r. 1073–1094).

The law and algorithm were introduced in a semi-tutorial by Srinivas M. Aji and [[Robert McEliece|Robert J. McEliece]] with the same title.&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

==Introduction==

''"The distributive law in mathematics is the law relating the operations of multiplication and addition, stated symbolically, &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the monomial factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is distributed, or separately applied, to each term of the binomial factor &lt;math&gt; b + c &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the product &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;"'' -  Britannica&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=distributive law|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166204/distributive-law|work=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it can be observed from the definition, application of distributive law to an arithmetic expression reduces the number of operations in it. In the previous example the total number of operations reduced from three (two multiplications and an addition in &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;) to two (one multiplication and one addition in &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) &lt;/math&gt;). Generalization of distributive law leads to a large family of [[fast algorithms]]. This includes the [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[Viterbi algorithm]].

This is explained in a more formal way in the example below:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum \limits_{c,d,e \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b) \, g(a, \, d, \, e) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued functions, &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d,e \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|A|=q&lt;/math&gt; (say)

Here we are "marginalizing out" the independent variables (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) to obtain the result. When we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that for each &lt;math&gt;q^{2}&lt;/math&gt; pairs of &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; terms due to the triplet &lt;math&gt;(c,d,e)&lt;/math&gt; which needs to take part in the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; with each step having one addition and one multiplication. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;2\cdot q^2 \cdot q^3 = 2q^5&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of the above function is &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we apply the distributive law to the RHS of the equation, we get the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}   \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b ) \cdot \sum _{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\,d,\,e) &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt; can be described as a product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{1}(a,b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\, d, \,e )&lt;/math&gt;

Now, when we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; additions in &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; each and there are &lt;math&gt;q^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications when we are using the product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;q^3 + q^3 + q^2 = 2q^3 + q^2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of calculating &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3})&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;O(n^{5})&lt;/math&gt;.  This shows by an example that applying distributive law reduces the computational complexity which is one of the good features of a "fast algorithm".

==History==

Some of the problems that used distributive law to solve can be grouped as follows

1. Decoding algorithms&lt;br&gt;
A GDL like algorithm was used by Gallager's for decoding low density parity-check codes. Based on Gallager's work Tanner introduced the [[Tanner graph]] and expressed Gallagers work in message passing form. The tanners graph also helped explain the  [[Viterbi algorithm]].

It is observed by Forney that Viterbi's maximum likelihood decoding of [[convolutional codes]] also used algorithms of GDL-like generality.

2. [[Forward-backward algorithm]]&lt;br&gt;
The forward backward algorithm helped as an algorithm for tracking the states in the [[markov chain]]. And this also was used the algorithm of GDL like generality

3. [[Artificial intelligence]]&lt;br&gt;
The notion of [[junction tree]]s has been used to solve many problems in AI. Also the concept of [[bucket elimination]] used many of the concepts.

==The MPF problem==

'''MPF or marginalize a product function''' is a general computational problem which as special case includes many classical problems such as computation of discrete [[Hadamard transform]], [[maximum likelihood decoding]] of a [[linear code]] over a memory-less [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[matrix chain multiplication]]. The power of the GDL lies in the fact that it applies to situations in which additions and multiplications are generalized.
A [[commutative semiring]] is a good framework for explaining this behavior. It is defined over a set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with operators "&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;.&lt;/math&gt;" where &lt;math&gt;(K,\, +)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(K,\, .)&lt;/math&gt; are a [[commutative monoid]]s and the distributive law holds.

Let &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_1 \in A_1, \ldots, p_n \in A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set and &lt;math&gt;|A_i| = q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;i = 1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;S = \{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \, \subset \{1,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, let
&lt;math&gt; A_{S}  = A_{i_1} \times \cdots \times A_{i_r} &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; p_{S} = (p_{i_1},\ldots, p_{i_r})&lt;/math&gt;,  
&lt;math&gt; q_{S} = |A_{S}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A  = A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p = \{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{S_{j}\}_{j=1}^M &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_{j} \subset \{1, ...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose a function is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[commutative semiring]]. Also, &lt;math&gt; p_{S_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; are named the ''local domains'' and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}&lt;/math&gt; as the ''local kernels''.

Now the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta : \mathbf A \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as :
&lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{1}, ...\,, p_{n}) = \prod_{i=1}^M \alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

''Definition of MPF problem'': For one or more indices &lt;math&gt;i = 1, ...\,, M&lt;/math&gt;, compute a table of the values of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;-''marginalization'' of the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is the function &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}:A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}(p_{S_{i}}) \, = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_{S_{i}^c} \in A_{S_{i}^c}} \beta(p)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;S_{i}^c&lt;/math&gt; is the complement of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \{1,...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\beta_i(p_{S_i})&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; ''objective function'', or the ''objective function'' at &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. It can observed that the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function in the obvious way needs &lt;math&gt;Mq_1 q_2 q_3\cdots q_{n}&lt;/math&gt; operations. This is because there are &lt;math&gt;q_1 q_2\cdots q_n&lt;/math&gt; additions and &lt;math&gt;(M-1)q_1 q_2...q_n&lt;/math&gt; multiplications needed in the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function. The GDL algorithm which is explained in the next section can reduce this computational complexity.

The following is an example of the MPF problem. 
Let &lt;math&gt;p_{1},\,p_{2},\,p_{3},\,p_{4},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5}&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_{1} \in A_{1}, p_{2} \in A_{2}, p_{3} \in A_{3}, p_{4} \in A_{4}, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5} \in A_{5}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;M=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \{\{1,2,5\},\{2,4\},\{1,4\}, \{2\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The given functions using these variables are &lt;math&gt;f(p_{1},p_{2},p_{5})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(p_{3},p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and we need to calculate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, \, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha(p_1, \, p_4) =  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_2 \in A_2,\, p_3 \in A_3, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1,\, p_2,\, p_5 ) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{2}) = \sum\limits_{p_1 \in A_1,\, p_3 \in A_3,\, p_4 \in A_4, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1, \, p_2, \, p_5) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4) &lt;/math&gt;

Here local domains and local kernels are defined as follows: 
{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(f(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_{2}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;g(p_{2}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;3^{rd}&lt;/math&gt; objective function and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;4^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function.

Let us consider another example where &lt;math&gt;p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4},r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4} \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is a real valued function. Now, we shall consider the MPF problem where the commutative semiring is defined as the set of real numbers with ordinary addition and multiplication and the local domains and local kernels are defined as follows:

{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;f(r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_1, r_1\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_1 r_1}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_2, r_2\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_2 r_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_3, r_3\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_3 r_3}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_4, r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_4 r_4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2, p_3, p_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now since the global kernel is defined as the product of the local kernels, it is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4, r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4) = f(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}&lt;/math&gt;

and the objective function at the local domain &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4) = \displaystyle\sum \limits_{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4} f(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4) \cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can see that the computation of [[Hadamard transform]] is a special case of the MPF problem. More examples can be demonstrated to prove that the MPF problem forms special cases of many classical problem as explained above whose details can be found at&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

== GDL: an algorithm for solving the MPF problem ==

If one can find a relationship among the elements of a given set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then one can solve the MPF problem basing on the notion of [[belief propagation]] which is a special use of "message passing" technique. The required relationship is that the given set of local domains can be organised into a [[junction tree]]. In other words, we create a graph theoretic tree with the elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as the vertices of the [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, such that for any two arbitrary vertices say &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; and there exists an edge between these two vertices, then the intersection of corresponding labels, viz &lt;math&gt;S_{i}\cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, is a subset of the label on each vertex on the unique path from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example,

Example 1: Consider the following nine local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above given set of local domains, one can organize them into a junction tree as shown below:

[[File:An example of a junction tree on a given set.png|center|An example of a junction of tree]]

Similarly If another set like the following is given

Example 2: Consider the following four local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then constructing the tree only with these local domains is not possible since this set of values has no common domains which can be placed between any two values of the above set. But however if add the two dummy domains as shown below then organizing the updated set into a junction tree would be possible and easy too.

5.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{1},p_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{2},p_{3}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for these set of domains, the junction tree looks like shown below:
[[File:Example of junction tree.png|center|Another example of a junction tree]]

===Generalized distributive law (GDL) algorithm===
Input: A set of local domains.&lt;br /&gt;
Output: For the given set of domains, possible minimum number of operations that is required to solve the problem is computed. &lt;br /&gt;
So, if &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are connected by an edge in the junction tree, then a message from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is a set/table of values given by a function: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math&gt;A_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. To begin with all the functions i.e. for all combinations of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in the given tree, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be identically &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and when a particular message is update, it follows the equation given below.

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}(p_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}})&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p_{S_{i}\setminus S_{j}}\in A_{S_{i} \setminus S_{j}}} \alpha _{i} (p_{S_{i}}) \prod_{{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i},{k \neq j}} \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(1)
 &lt;/math&gt;
    
where &lt;math&gt;v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;v_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is an adjacent vertex to &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; in tree.

Similarly each vertex has a state which is defined as a table containing the values from the function &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt;, Just like how messages initialize to 1 identically, state of &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be local kernel &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;, but whenever &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}&lt;/math&gt; gets updated, it follows the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i})  =   \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Basic working of the algorithm===
For the given set of local domains as input, we find out if we can create a junction tree, either by using the set directly or by adding dummy domains to the set first and then creating the junction tree, if construction junction is not possible then algorithm output that there is no way to reduce the number of steps to compute the given equation problem, but once we have junction tree, algorithm will have to schedule messages and compute states, by doing these we can know where steps can be reduced, hence will be discusses this below.

== Scheduling of the message passing and the state computation ==

There are two special cases we are going to talk about here namely ''Single Vertex Problem'' in which the objective function is computed at only one vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{0}&lt;/math&gt;  and the second one is ''All Vertices Problem'' where the goal is to compute the objective function at all vertices.

Lets begin with the '''single-vertex problem''', GDL will start by directing each edge towards the targeted vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. Here messages are sent only in the direction towards the targeted vertex. Note that all the directed messages are sent only once. The messages are started from the leaf nodes(where the degree is 1) go up towards the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The message travels from the leaves to its parents and then from there to their parents and so on until it reaches the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; will compute its state only when it receives all messages from all its neighbors. Once we have the state, We have got the answer and hence the algorithm terminates.

For Example, Lets consider a junction tree constructed from the set of local domains given above i.e. the set from example 1, &lt;br /&gt;Now the Scheduling table for these domains is (where the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;\text{Round                      Message or State Computation} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \alpha_{8}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \Sigma_{p_{2}} \alpha_{9}(p_{2},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3.\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) = \alpha_{5}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4.\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{6}(p_{1},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5.\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) = \alpha_{7}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6.\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{4}(p_{3},p_{4}).\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}).\mu_{9,4}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7.\mu_{3,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{1}} \alpha_{3}(p_{2},p_{1}).\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}).\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8.\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{3}} \alpha_{2}(p_{3},p_{2}).\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}).\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;9.\sigma_{1}(p_{2}) = \alpha_{1}(p_{2}).\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}).\mu_{3,1}(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the complexity for Single Vertex GDL can be shown as

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt;  arithmetic operations&lt;br /&gt;
Where (Note: The explanation for the above equation is explained later in the article )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the label of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. number of vertices adjacent to v).

To solve the '''All-Vertices''' problem, we can schedule GDL in several ways, some of them are parallel implementation where in each round, every state is updated and every message is computed and transmitted at the same time. In this type of implementation the states and messages will stabilizes after number of rounds that is at most equal to the diameter of the tree. At this point all the all states of the vertices will be equal to the desired objective function.

Another way to schedule GDL for this problem is serial implementation where its similar to the  Single vertex problem except that we don't stop the algorithm until all the vertices of a required set have not got all the messages from all their neighbors and have compute their state. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the number of arithmetic this implementation requires is at most &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v \in V} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations.

==Constructing a junction tree==

The key to constructing a junction tree lies in the local domain graph &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a weighted complete graph with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; vertices &lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots ,v_M&lt;/math&gt; i.e. one for each local domain, having the weight of the edge  &lt;math&gt;e_{i,j} : v_i \leftrightarrow v_j&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\omega_{i,j} = |S_{i} \cap S_{j}|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;x_{k} \in S_{i} \cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, then we say &lt;math&gt;x_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is contained in&lt;math&gt;e_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;. Denoted by &lt;math&gt;\omega_{max}&lt;/math&gt; (the weight of a maximal-weight spanning tree of &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\omega^{*} = \Sigma ^M_{i=1}|S_{i}| - n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of elements in that set. For more clarity and details, please refer to these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319085443/http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }} The Junction Tree Algorithms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~cs691t/SS02/lectures/week7.PDF The Junction Tree Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;'T'&lt;/math&gt; be a junction tree with vertex set &lt;math&gt;'V'&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt;. In this algorithm, the messages are sent in both the direction on any edge, so we can say/regard the edge set E as set of ordered pairs of vertices. For example, from Figure 1 &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows

: &lt;math&gt;E = \{(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(4,2),(2,4),(5,2),(2,5),(6,3),(3,6),(7,3),(3,7),(8,4),(4,8),(9,4),(4,9)\}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; above gives you all the possible directions that a message can travel in the tree.

The schedule for the GDL is defined as a finite sequence of subsets of&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Which is generally represented by 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;E_{1},E_{2},E_{3},\ldots, E_{N}&lt;/math&gt;}, Where &lt;math&gt;E_{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of messages updated during the &lt;math&gt;N^{th}&lt;/math&gt; round of running the algorithm.

Having defined/seen some notations, we will see want the theorem says,
When we are given a schedule &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =\{ E_1,E_2,E_3,\ldots, E_N\}&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding [[Trellis (graph)|message trellis]] as a finite directed graph with Vertex set of  &lt;math&gt;V \times \{0,1,2,3,\ldots, N\}&lt;/math&gt;, in which a typical element is denoted by &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;t \in \{0,1,2,3,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;, Then after completion of the message passing, state at  vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; will be the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective defined in

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i}) = \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_{k}\cap S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;nowiki&gt;iff&lt;/nowiki&gt; there is a path from &lt;math&gt;v_i(0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_j(N)&lt;/math&gt;

== Computational complexity ==

Here we try to explain the complexity of solving the MPF problem in terms of the number of mathematical operations required for the calculation. i.e. We compare the number of operations required when calculated using the normal method (Here by normal method we mean by methods that do not use message passing or junction trees in short methods that do not use the concepts of GDL)and the number of operations using the generalized distributive law.

Example: Let us consider the simplest case where we need to compute the following expression &lt;math&gt;ab+ac&lt;/math&gt;.

To evaluate this expression naively requires two multiplications and one addition. The expression when expressed using the distributive law can be written as &lt;math&gt;a(b+c)&lt;/math&gt; a simple optimization that reduces the number of operations to one addition and one multiplication.

Similar to the above explained example we will be expressing the equations in different forms to perform as few operation as possible by applying the GDL.

As explained in the previous sections we solve the problem by using the concept of the junction trees. The optimization obtained by the use of these trees is comparable to the optimization obtained by solving a semi group problem on trees. For example, to find the minimum of a group of numbers we can observe that if we have a tree and the elements are all at the bottom of the tree, then we can compare the minimum of two items in parallel and the resultant minimum will be written to the parent. When this process is propagated up the tree the minimum of the group of elements will be found at the root.

The following is the complexity for solving the junction tree using message passing

We rewrite the formula used earlier to the following form. This is the eqn for a message to be sent from vertex ''v'' to ''w''

: &lt;math&gt;\mu _{v,w} (p_{v \cap w}) =  \sum _{p _{v \setminus w} \in A _{S(v) \setminus S(w)}} \alpha _{v} (p _{v})  \prod _{u adj v _{u \neq v}} \mu _{u,v} (p _{u \cap v})&lt;/math&gt;            ----message equation
 
Similarly we rewrite the equation for calculating the state of vertex v as follows

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_v(p_v) =  \alpha_v (p_v) \prod_{u \operatorname{adj} v} \mu _{v,w} (p _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

We first will analyze for the single-vertex problem and assume the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and hence we have one edge from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v _{0}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Suppose we have an edge &lt;math&gt;(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; we calculate the message using the message equation. To calculate &lt;math&gt;p _{u \cap v}&lt;/math&gt; requires

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} -1 &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} (d(v)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

(We represent the &lt;math&gt;|A _{S(v) \ S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;q _{v \setminus w}&lt;/math&gt;.)

But there will be many possibilities for &lt;math&gt;x _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; q _{v \cap w} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} | A _{S(v) \cap S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; possibilities for &lt;math&gt;p _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the entire message will need

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w})(q _{v \setminus w} -1)  = q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w}) q _{v \setminus w}. (d(v) -1) = (d(v) -1) q _v&lt;/math&gt;
multiplications

The total number of arithmetic operations required to send a message towards &lt;math&gt;v_0 &lt;/math&gt;along the edges of tree will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sum _{ v \neq v0} (q_v - q _{v \cap w})&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{ v \neq v0}  (d(v) - 1) q_v&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

Once all the messages have been transmitted the algorithm terminates with the computation of state at &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;  The state computation requires &lt;math&gt;d(v_0) q _0&lt;/math&gt; more multiplications.
Thus number of calculations required to calculate the state is given as below

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (d(v) -1) q _{v} + d(v _{0})q _{v _{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications

Thus the grand total of the number of calculations is

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (T) = \sum _{v \in V} d(v)q _{v} - \sum _{e \in E} q _{e}&lt;/math&gt; ----&lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; is an edge and its size is defined by &lt;math&gt;q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above gives us the upper bound.

If we define the complexity of the edge &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (e) = q _{v} + q _{w} - q _{v \cap w} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(T) = \sum _{e \in E} \chi (e)&lt;/math&gt;

We now calculate the edge complexity for the problem defined in Figure 1 as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,2) = q_2 + q_2 q_3 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,4) = q_3 q_4 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,5) = q_3 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,8) = q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,9) = q_2 q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,3) = q _2 + q_2 q_1 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,7) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 - q_1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,6) = q_1 q _4 + q _1 q_2 - q _1&lt;/math&gt;

The total complexity will be &lt;math&gt; 3 q _{2}q _{3} + 3q _{3}q _{4}+ 3 q _{1}q _{2}+q _{2}q _{4} + q _{1}q _{4} - q _{1} - q _{3} - q _{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is considerably low compared to the direct method. (Here by direct method we mean by methods that do not use message passing. The time taken using the direct method will be the equivalent to calculating message at each node and time to calculate the state of each of the nodes.)

Now we consider the all-vertex problem where the message will have to be sent in both the directions and state must be computed at both the vertexes. This would take &lt;math&gt; O( \sum _{v} d(v) d(v) q _{v}) &lt;/math&gt; but by precomputing we can reduce the number of multiplications to &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the vertex. Ex : If there is a set &lt;math&gt;(a _{1}, \ldots ,a _{d})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; numbers. It is possible to compute all the d products of &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt; a _{i}&lt;/math&gt; with at most &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications rather than the obvious &lt;math&gt; d(d-2) &lt;/math&gt;. 
We do this by precomputing the quantities 
&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_1, b_2= b_1 \cdot a_2 = a_1 \cdot a _2, b _{d-1} = b _{d-2} \cdot a_{d-1} = a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_d = a_d, c_{d-1} = a_{d-1} c_d = a _{d-1} \cdot a_d, \ldots , c_2 = a _2 \cdot c_3 = a _2 a_3 \cdots a_d&lt;/math&gt; this takes &lt;math&gt; 2 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications. Then if &lt;math&gt; m_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the product of all &lt;math&gt; a_i&lt;/math&gt; except for &lt;math&gt; a_j&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; m_1 = c_2, m_2 = b_1 \cdot c_3&lt;/math&gt; and so on will need another &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications making the total &lt;math&gt; 3 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt;

There is not much we can do when it comes to the construction of the junction tree except that we may have many maximal weight spanning tree and we should choose the spanning tree with the least &lt;math&gt;\chi(T)&lt;/math&gt; and sometimes this might mean adding a local domain to lower the junction tree complexity.

It may seem that GDL is correct only when the local domains can be expressed as a junction tree. But even in cases where there are cycles and a number of iterations the messages will approximately be equal to the objective function. The experiments on Gallager–Tanner–Wiberg algorithm for low density parity-check codes were supportive of this claim.

'''Helpers at the nest''' is a term used in [[behavioural ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] to describe a social structure in which [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] and [[sexually mature]] [[adolescent]]s of either one or both sexes, remain in association with their parents and help them raise subsequent [[offspring|brood]]s or [[litter]]s, instead of dispersing and beginning to reproduce themselves. This phenomenon was first studied in [[bird]]s where it occurs most frequently, but it is also known in animals from many different groups including [[mammal]]s and [[insect]]s. It is a simple form of [[co-operative breeding]].

It occurs in between three and eight percent of bird [[species]] worldwide (estimates vary), but is much more common in [[Australia]] and [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jetz, Walter  |author2=Rubenstein, Dustin R.|title=Environmental Uncertainty and the Global Biogeography of Cooperative Breeding in Birds|journal=Current Biology|volume= 21|issue=1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49708773_Environmental_uncertainty_and_the_global_biogeography_of_cooperative_breeding_in_birds|pages= 72–78|year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.075|pmid=21185192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B. (1992) ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'', Catena Verlag, {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird species in which this behaviour is found include the [[common moorhen]], the [[acorn woodpecker]], and the [[apostlebird]]. The [[sugar glider]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and [[human]]s are examples of mammals that exhibit this behaviour. It is also seen in a number of species of bee such as [[carpenter bee]]s (note this is distinct from the behaviour of the [[European honey bee]], where the worker bees are sterile and incapable of reproducing).

The term "helper" was coined by [[Alexander Skutch]] in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/Auk/v052n03/p0257-p0273.pdf|author=Skutch, A. F. |year=1935|title=Helpers at the nest|journal=Auk|volume= 52|pages=257–273|issue=3|doi=10.2307/4077738}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined more carefully in 1961 in the avian context as "a bird which assists in the nesting of an individual other than its mate, or feeds or otherwise attends a bird of whatever age which is neither its mate nor its dependent offspring." The term has been criticised as being [[anthropomorphic]], but it remains in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brown, J. L. |year=1978|title=Avian communal breeding systems|journal=Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst.|volume=9|pages=123–155|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.09.110178.001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three explanations for the occurrence of helpers at the nest have been put forward; they are not mutually exclusive, and in any particular species an investigation of the exact benefits and costs will be needed to see what combination of these factors may have driven the evolution of helping.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, J. L.; Hatchwell, B. J. (2004) "Fitness consequences of helping" in ''Ecology and evolution of cooperative breeding in birds'' by Walter D. Koenig, Janis L. Dickinson. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-53099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Advantage to the helpers, who may be protected from predation, or gain skills that they will need when they subsequently reproduce, as a result of staying in the parental nest.
*[[Kin selection]]: since subsequent litters or broods from the same parents will be full siblings to the helpers, they are as closely related genetically as their own offspring would be. Helping their parents is therefore as productive for the juveniles as reproducing themselves would be, and if their parents are better able to reproduce, the balance of advantage may be greater.
*Delayed advantage to the helpers, in particular because they stand to inherit their parents' [[territory (animal)|territory]]; this explanation is particularly compelling if suitable territories are in short supply, but requires specific quantitative conditions to be met, favouring a stable queue of potential heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wiley, R. H. |author2=Rabenold, K. N. |year=1984 |title=The evolution of cooperative breeding by delayed reciprocity and queuing for favorable social positions |url=http://bilbo.bio.purdue.edu/~www_eco/faculty/rabenold/pdfs/EvoCooperativeBreeding%20by%20delayed%20reciprocity.pdf |journal=Evolution |volume=38 |pages=609–621 |doi=10.2307/2408710 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617053619/http://bilbo.bio.purdue.edu/~www_eco/faculty/rabenold/pdfs/EvoCooperativeBreeding%20by%20delayed%20reciprocity.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is frequently assumed that helpers are non-breeders, molecular evidence suggests that this may happen, and the term "secondary helper" is sometimes used in this case to indicate helpers that mate with or are not related offspring of the pair being assisted. The term "primary helper" being used for the commoner case of the helper being offspring of the pair and not involved in mating.&lt;ref&gt;Ligon, J. D.; Burt, D. B. (2004) "Evolutionary origins" in ''Ecology and evolution of cooperative breeding in birds'' by Walter D. Koenig, Janis L. Dickinson. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-53099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapair mates are chosen by the females and are these then contribute to the care of the young who may be sired by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Female extrapair mate choice in a cooperative breeder: trading sex for help and increasing offspring heterozygosity|author = Rubenstein, DR |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0424 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year= 2007|volume=274| issue=1620 | pages=1895–1903|pmid=17526455|pmc=2270931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juveniles living in association with their parents cannot automatically be regarded as helpers. In a number of species, such as [[Orthonychidae|the logrunners]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frith, C.B., Frith, D.W. &amp; Jansen, A. |year=1997|title=The nesting biology of the Chowchilla ''Orthonyx spaldingii'' (Orthonychidae)|doi=10.1071/MU97002|journal=Emu|volume=97|pages=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Siberian jay]], young remain in the parental territory, but never help feed nestlings. However the delayed advantage explanation for the juveniles' association with their parents can still work in the absence of effective helping, whereas the kin selection explanation cannot.

==Lewontin's argument==
In the 1972 study "The Apportionment of Human Diversity", [[Richard Lewontin]] performed a [[fixation index]] (''F''&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) statistical analysis using 17 markers, including blood group proteins, from individuals across classically defined "races" (Caucasian, African, Mongoloid, South Asian Aborigines, Amerinds, Oceanians, and Australian Aborigines). He found that the majority of the total genetic variation between humans (i.e., of the 0.1% of DNA that varies between individuals), 85.4%, is found within populations, 8.3% of the variation is found between populations within a "race", and only 6.3% was found to account for the racial classification. Numerous later studies have confirmed his findings.&lt;ref name = "Ramachandran"/&gt; Based on this analysis, Lewontin concluded, "Since such racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance either, no justification can be offered for its continuance."

This argument has been cited as evidence that racial categories are biologically meaningless, and that behavioral differences between groups cannot have any genetic underpinnings.&lt;ref name="Marks"/&gt; One example is the "Statement on 'Race'" published by the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1998, which rejected the existence of races as unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups.&lt;ref name = "AAA"&gt;{{Cite web

| url = http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edwards' critique==
{{See also|Race and genetics}}

Edwards argued that while Lewontin's statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different [[allele]]s (variants of a particular gene) at an individual [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time. This happens because differences in the frequency of alleles at different loci are correlated across populations—the alleles that are more frequent in a population at two or more loci are correlated when we consider the two populations simultaneously. Or in other words, the frequency of the alleles tends to cluster differently for different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Edwards's words, "most of the information that distinguishes populations is hidden in the correlation structure of the data." These relationships can be extracted using commonly used [[ordination (statistics)|ordination]] and [[cluster analysis]] techniques. Edwards argued that, even if the probability of misclassifying an individual based on the frequency of alleles at a single locus is as high as 30 percent (as Lewontin reported in 1972), the misclassification probability becomes close to zero if enough loci are studied.&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA: promise and peril |last1=McCabe |first1=Linda L. |last2=McCabe |first2=Edward R. B. |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=76–77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKrsBcU_DikC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Lewontin's+Fallacy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JQIeTo-DBcXXiALGhe3-CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lewontin's%20Fallacy%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards's paper stated that the underlying logic was discussed in the early years of the 20th century. Edwards wrote that he and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] had presented a contrasting analysis to Lewontin's, using very similar data, already at the 1963 International Congress of Genetics. Lewontin participated in the conference but did not refer to this in his later paper. Edwards argued that Lewontin used his analysis to attack human classification in science for social reasons.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt;

==Response to Edwards==

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] discusses genetic variation across human races in his book ''The Ancestor's Tale''.&lt;ref name=Dawkins /&gt;  In the chapter ''The Grasshopper's Tale'', he characterizes the genetic variation between races as a very small fraction of the total human genetic variation.  He goes on to disagree with Lewontin's conclusions about taxonomy, writing, "However small the racial partition of the total variation may be, if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlate with other racial characteristics, they are by definition informative, and therefore of taxonomic significance."&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; [[Neven Sesardic]] has argued that, unbeknownst to Edwards, Jeffry B. Mitton already made the same argument about Lewontin's claim in two articles published in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sesardic | first1 = Neven | title = Race: a social destruction of a biological concept | doi = 10.1007/s10539-009-9193-7 | journal = Biology &amp; Philosophy | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–162 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mitton | first1 = J.

Similarly, biological anthropologist [[Jonathan Marks (anthropologist)|Jonathan Marks]] agrees with Edwards that correlations between geographical areas and genetics obviously exist in human populations, but goes on to note that "What is unclear is what this has to do with 'race' as that term has been used through much in the twentieth century—the mere fact that we can find groups to be different and can reliably allot people to them is trivial. Again, the point of the theory of race was to discover large clusters of people that are principally homogeneous within and heterogeneous between, contrasting groups. Lewontin's analysis shows that such groups do not exist in the human species, and Edwards' critique does not contradict that interpretation."&lt;ref name="Marks"/&gt;

The view that, while geographic clustering of biological traits does exist, this does not lend biological validity to racial groups, was proposed by several evolutionary anthropologists and geneticists prior to the publication of Edwards critique of Lewontin.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon ''et al.'' attempt to answer the question, "How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?". The answer depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity, and the populations being compared. When they analysed three geographically distinct populations (European, African and East Asian) and measured [[genetic similarity]] over many thousands of loci, the answer to their question was "never". However, measuring similarity using smaller numbers of loci yielded substantial overlap between these populations. Rates of between-population similarity also increased when geographically intermediate and admixed populations were included in the analysis.&lt;ref name="Witherspoon"/&gt;

[[Image:Restoration.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Original and restored image.]]

'''Inpainting''' is the process of [[image reconstruction|reconstructing]] lost or deteriorated parts of [[Digital image|images]] and [[Digital video|videos]]. In the museum world, in the case of a valuable painting, this task would be carried out by a skilled art [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] or art restorer. In the digital world, inpainting (also known as ''image interpolation'' or ''video interpolation'') refers to the application of sophisticated [[algorithm]]s to replace lost or corrupted parts of the image data (mainly small regions or to remove small defects).

== Applications ==
There are many objectives and applications of this technique.

In [[photography]] and [[Film|cinema]], is used for [[film restoration]]; to reverse the deterioration (e.g., cracks in photographs or scratches and dust spots in film; see [[infrared cleaning]]). It is also used for removing [[red eye effect|red-eye]], the stamped date from photographs and removing objects to creative effect.

This technique can be used to replace the lost blocks in the coding and transmission of images, for example, in a [[streaming video]]. It can also be used to remove logos in videos.

[[Deep learning]] [[neural network]] based inpainting can be used for decensoring images.&lt;ref name="urlThis Researcher Created ‘DeepCreamPy,’ a Machine Learning Algorithm That Uncensors Hentai - Motherboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43ekxg/machine-learning-algorithm-that-uncensors-hentai-porn-deepcreampy |title=This Researcher Created ‘DeepCreamPy,’ a Machine Learning Algorithm That Uncensors Hentai - Motherboard |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
=== In painting ===
Inpainting is rooted in the restoration of images. Traditionally, inpainting has been done by professional restorers. The underlying methodology of their work is as follows:
* The global picture determines how to fill in the gap. The purpose of inpainting is to restore the unity of the work.
* The structure of the gap surroundings is supposed to be continued into the gap. Contour lines that arrive at the gap boundary are prolonged into the gap.
* The different regions inside a gap, as defined by the contour lines, are filled with colors matching for those of its boundary.
* The small details are painted, i.e. “texture” is added.

=== Computerized ===
Since the wide applications of digital camera and the digitalization of old photos, inpainting has become an automatic process that is performed on digital images. More than scratch removing, the inpainting techniques are also applied to object removal, text removal and other automatic modifications of images and videos. Furthermore, they can also be observed in applications like [[image compression]] and [[super resolution]].

Three main groups of 2D image inpainting algorithms can be found in literature. The first one to be noted is structural inpainting, the second one is texture inpainting and the last one is a combination of these two techniques. All these inpainting methods have one thing in common - they use the information of the known or undestroyed image areas in order to fill the gap.

==== Structural inpainting ====
Structural inpainting uses geometric approaches{{clarify|post-text=(What is does "geometric approaches" mean in this context?)|date=November 2018}} for filling in the missing information in the region which should be inpainted. These algorithms focus on the consistency of the geometric structure.{{clarify|post-text=(What is "the geometric structure" referred to?)|date=November 2018}}

==== Textural inpainting ====
Like everything else the structural inpainting methods have both advantages and disadvantages. The main problem is that all the structural inpainting methods are not able to restore texture. Texture has a repetitive pattern which means that a missing portion cannot be restored by continuing the level lines into the gap.{{clarify|post-text=(What are "level lines"?)|date=November 2018}}

==== Combined structural and textural inpainting ====
Combined structural and textural inpainting approaches simultaneously try to perform texture and structure filling in regions of missing image information.
Most parts of an image consist of texture and structure. The boundaries between image regions accumulate structural information which is a complex phenomenon.{{clarify|post-text=(What does it mean that boundaries "accumulate information"?)|date=November 2018}} This is the result when blending different textures together. That is why, the state of the art inpainting method attempts to combine structural and textural inpainting.

A more traditional method is to use [[differential equation]]s (such as the [[Laplace's equation]]) with Dirichlet boundary conditions for continuity (a seamless fit).{{clarify|post-text=(What is a Dirichlet boundary and how does it make something a seamless fit, and what is a seamless fit in this context?)|date=November 2018}} This works well if missing information lies within the homogeneous portion of an object area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other methods follow [[Contour line|isophote]] directions (in an image, a contour of equal luminance), to do the inpainting.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bertalmío, G. Sapiro, V. Caselles and C. Ballester., "Image Inpainting", Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2000, New Orleans, USA, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Model based inpainting follows the Bayesian approach for which missing information is best fitted or estimated from the combination of the models of the underlying images as well as the image data actually being observed. In deterministic language, this has led to various variational inpainting models.{{clarify|post-text=(Please rewrite this sentence in plain English.)|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Chan and J. Shen, "Mathematical Models for Local Nontexture Inpainting", SIAM J. Applied Math., 62(3), 2001, 1019-1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manual computer methods include using a [[clone tool]] or healing tool,{{clarify|post-text=(What is a healing tool?)|date=November 2018}} to copy existing parts of the image to restore a damaged texture. [[Texture synthesis]] may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture_replace/ Image Replacement through Texture Synthesis], Homan Igehy and Lucas Pereira, Stanford University, Appears in the Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing&lt;/ref&gt;

Exemplar-based image inpainting attempts to automate the clone tool process.  It fills "holes" in the image by searching for similar patches in a nearby source region of the image, and copying the pixels from the most similar patch into the hole.  By performing the fill at the patch level as opposed to the pixel level, the algorithm reduces blurring artifacts caused by prior techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211538 Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting], Criminisi, A, Perez, P., &amp; Toyama, K., Appears in the Proceedings of the 2003 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5766709&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dlorenzi+melgani Inpainting Strategies for Reconstruction of Missing Data in VHR Images], L.

The '''Leyden papyrus X''' ('''P. Leyden X''') is a [[papyrus]] [[codex]] written in Greek at about the end of the 3rd century A.D.&lt;ref name=caley1149&gt;E.R.Caley, ''The Leyden Paprus X: An English Translation with Brief Notes'', [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/radcliffe-leyden-papyrus/page_001 p.1149]: "These two papyri have, however, upon the basis of unquestioned philological and paleographic evidence, been ascertained to have been written at about the end of the third century A.D. so that they are by far the earliest original historical evidence that we have in our possession concerning the nature and the extent of ancient chemical knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps around 250 A.D. and buried with its owner,&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Lynette Irby-Massie, Paul Turquand Keyser, ''Greek science of the Hellenistic era: a sourcebook'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qXZo6oOr9SgC&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=%22leyden%20papyrus%20X%22&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q=%22leyden%20papyrus%20X%22&amp;f=false p.251]&lt;/ref&gt; and today preserved at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands.

== Origin ==

The Leiden papyrus was discovered at Thebes in Egypt, together with the [[Stockholm Papyrus]], which was probably written by the same scribe,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton J. Linden, ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=isJY9jWdru0C&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=%22leyden%20papyrus%20X%22&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=%22leyden%20papyrus%20X%22&amp;f=false p.46].&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Greek magical papyri]], in the early 19th century by an adventurer calling himself [[Giovanni Anastasi (merchant)|Jean d'Anastasi]], holding the office of Swedish vice-consul in Alexandria.  In 1828 he sold a number of papyri to the Dutch government, which were lodged at the Leiden University Library, and labelled alphabetically from A to Z.

The papyri were first published and translated into Latin by [[Conrad Leemans]] in 1885 (Papyri graeci musei antiquarii publici Lugduni Batavi). Papyri A to U relate to matters concerning Ancient Egyptian law. Papyri V, W and X deal with alchemy.

The related [[Stockholm papyrus]] was found together with these, and Anastasy donated it to Sweden in 1832. It was first published by [[Otto Lagercrantz]] in 1913 (Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis). Whereas the Leiden papyrus X deals with metallurgy, the Stockholm papyrus deals with gems, pearls and textile dyeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Edmund Lippmann | title=Entstehung und Ausbreitung der Alchemie | publisher=Springer | year=1919 | pages=1–10 | url=https://archive.org/details/entstehungundaus00lippuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus V ==
Papyrus V contains a recipe for a mystical ink made of [[misy]] (oxidized [[pyrite]] ores, a mix of copper and iron sulfates), [[green vitriol]], [[oak apple]], gum, and of a substance composed of 7 perfumes and 7 flowers. It has a recipe for purifying gold with [[cement royal]]. It gives a list of 37 secret names of plants, invented by holy scribes, containing code names such as "snake's blood" , "rat's tail", and "lion's semen". Traces of this nomenclature survive in botanical names, like in German "Löwenzahn" and [[wolf's milk]]; also in [[dragon's blood]], which probably still denotes the same resin as in ancient times. Some of these aliases are given by Dioscorides, but with different meanings.&lt;ref name="berthelot"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Marcellin Berthelot]] | title=Introduction à l'étude de la chimie des anciens et du moyen âge | publisher=Steinheil | year=1889 | pages=3–28 | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3815b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus W ==
Papyrus W contains magical invocations and Judaeo-Gnostic content. The 7 perfumes are given as: [[styrax]] dedicated to Saturn, [[malabathrum]] to Jupiter, [[costus]] to Mars, [[frankincense]] to the Sun, [[nard (plant)|nard]] to Venus, [[cinnamomum cassia|cassia]] to Hermes, [[myrrh]] to the Moon. The 7 flowers are: [[Nard (plant)|nard]], [[marjoram]], [[lily]], [[Lotus flower|lotus]], [[buttercup]], [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[Viola alba|white violet]].&lt;ref name="berthelot" /&gt;

== Papyrus X ==
The papyrus consists of 10 leaves, 30 x 34&amp;nbsp;cm in size, folded lengthwise and making 20 pages, of which 16 contain writing.  Each page has 28-47 lines.  The text contains one hundred and eleven recipes for extracting precious metals, or counterfeiting such metals, or precious stones and purple dye.  It also contains details of the manufacture of textiles, and making gold and silver inks.  The recipes are not detailed, and probably served as an aide-memoire for those already familiar with the process.  The presentation is exclusively practical, and does not include the usual alchemical or philosophical elements.  The last eleven recipes are simply short extracts from the ''Materia Medica'' of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]. They are chiefly descriptions of certain minerals.

The Leiden papyrus X quotes Dioscorides without spurious additions that may have been introduced by later scribes. For example, [[Kurt Sprengel]]'s edition of [[De materia medica]] writes that mercury is stored in glass, leaden, tin and silver vessels. While it is true that glass is unaffected by mercury, all the metals named are attacked, and [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimus]] takes special care in pointing that out. The Dioscorides extract in the Leiden papyrus X recommends only glass for storing mercury.&lt;ref name="berthelot" /&gt;

A '''marine sandglass''' is a [[timepiece]] of simple design that is a relative of the common [[hourglass]], a marine (nautical) instrument known since the 14th century (although reasonably presumed to be of very ancient use and origin). They were employed to measure the time at sea or on a given [[navigation]]al course, in repeated measures of small time increments (e.g., 30 minutes). Used together with the [[chip log]], smaller marine sandglasses were also used to measure the boat speed through the water in knots.

Although vital to maritime navigation, marine sandglasses were not accurate measuring instruments for the passage of time; many design and environmental factors could affect the duration of sand's flow, and therefore its reported time. Their use continued through the early 19th century, when they were supplanted by reliable [[Marine chronometer|mechanical timepieces]], and by other advances in [[marine navigation]].

Marine sandglasses were very popular on board ships, as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea.  Unlike the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass.  The fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements, as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes.&lt;ref name="Balmer"&gt;Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632 Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632.&lt;/ref&gt;  In conjunction with a record of a ship's speed and direction, seamen used the hourglass to determine their position with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name="Balmer" /&gt;

==Design and use==
Marine sandglasses originally consisted of two glass bottles one inverted above the other, connected by a small tube, with the ends wrapped and so joined together. Over time, the later progress in the art of [[glassblowing]] allowed them to be made in a single piece. The marine glass was filled with sand or a suitable material such as finely ground eggshell, lead or tin chips (used to avoid humidity). This flowing material was chosen with two main objectives: to avoid the humidity and to absorb motion, both required for shipboard use.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Placed in the upper half, the sand would flow slowly and steadily towards the lower half by the action of gravity, taking a certain time to empty (that was calibrated during their design and manufacture). Once the upper portion of the glass was empty, the glass could be turned to measure another time period.&lt;ref name=MAY&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Marine Navigation|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=UO5yQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=a+history+of+marine+navigation&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CVZVVNOsIczbaN-RguAL&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA| pages=108–110|date=1973| publisher=Norton| isbn=978-0-393-03140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the hourglass is unclear, although unlike its predecessor the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], or [[water clock]], which may have been invented in ancient Egypt, the first referenced use:
*According to The American Institute of New York: The clepsammia or sand-glass was invented at Alexandria about 150 B. C.&lt;ref name="York1870"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Institute of the City of New York|title=Annual Report of the American Institute of the City of New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C8LAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1042|date=1870|publisher=C. van Benthuysen.|pages=1042–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'': the so-called clepsammia were in use before the time of St Jerome (335 AD) &lt;ref name="Association1873"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Archaeological Association|title=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJRYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|date=1873|publisher=Brit.

*M.Llauradó, found during an investigation, the first representation of an hourglass in a sarcophagus dated c. 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, discovered in Rome in the 18th century, and studied by Wincklemann in the 19th century, who remarked the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands.&lt;ref name="Museum1810"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Museum|title=A Description of the Collection of Ancient Terracottas in the British Museum ; with Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4NV9XLg_yUC&amp;pg=PT88|date=1810|publisher=K.

The earliest recorded reference that can be said with certainty to refer to a marine sandglass dates from c. 1345, in a receipt of Thomas de Stetesham, clerk of the King's ship ''La George'', in the reign of [[Edward III]] of England; translated from the Latin, the receipt says: in 1345:&lt;ref name="Turner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony John Turner|title=Of Time and Measurement: Studies in the History of Horology and Fine Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNDbAAAAMAAJ|date=1993|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-86078-378-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stetesham"/&gt;

This "orloge de mer" or "heures de naviguer" was sent to him, as a present, when he still was a prince (being therefore prior to 1356 when he took the place of his imprisoned father), by his aunt [[Yolande of Aragon]], when asking him for a manuscript of [[John de Mandeville]], to be translated to the Aragonese tongue.&lt;ref name="Yolande"&gt;{{cite book|title=Johan I D'Arago|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kb3SJxHaTpUC&amp;pg=PA128|publisher=Institut d'Estudis Catalans|pages=128–|id=GGKEY:8CXSF5T5A0D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance in navigation ==
[[File:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|thumb|Sandglass in a three-legged stand]]
In long-distance navigation through the open ocean, the sandglass or "glass" used to measure the time was a tool as important as the compass (which indicated sailing direction, and so ship's course).&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Filled with the amount of sand suitable for measuring a lapse of half an hour, each time the sand emptied was also called a "glass"; eight glasses (four hours) defined a "watch".&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The times determined by the sandglass, along with the record in the logbook of the speed measured with the "[[chip log]]", permitted the ship's navigator to plot his map position.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Multiplying the ship's speed by the time the course had been kept (measured with the glass), gave traveled distance,&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; a simple, overall method termed [[dead reckoning]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

The marine sandglass was critical for maritime navigation before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; At the beginning of that century it became possible to navigate by the lunar distances, thanks to the tables of [[haversine]]s of [[Josef de Mendoza y Ríos|Joseph de Mendoza y Ríos]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Prior to this, dead reckoning navigation based on sandglass-determined times was used, alongside determination of latitude using the [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] (see also [[backstaff]], [[astrolabe]], and [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]);&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; this was the only system available to mariners to navigate the globe.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The parallel use of relative time measurements at sea, and time measurement by mechanical clocks on land continued from at least 1350 to 1805, i.e., for more than 450 years.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Although vital to navigation, the marine glass was not an accurate instrument to measure the passage of time.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The design of the glass affected its accuracy in time measurement; the uniformity in fineness of the sand, the inner diameter of the connecting tube, and design aspects allowing wear that would effect the flow of sand all could contribute.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; In addition, many shipboard factors could affect the duration of sand's flow and therefore influence the time measured, including the humidity inside the glass, the ability for it to be positioned in a perfectly vertical position, and the acceleration or deceleration of the ship's movements.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Finally, the use of short duration glasses to measure long periods of time introduced further error.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Marine glass use was supplanted by reliable [[Marine chronometer|mechanical timepieces]], and by other advances in [[marine navigation]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

==Watch sandglasses==
[[Image:Loch à plateau.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Ship log sandglass in the left of the ship's log.]]
Watch sandglasses were used on ships to measure watch times, typically in half-hour periods. The helmsman&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; or ship's page&lt;ref Name=Bergreen&gt;{{Cite book| title = Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe | last = Bergreen | first = Laurence | date = 2003 | publisher = William Morrow | ISBN = 0-06-621173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the crewmen responsible for turning the watch sandglass, thus supplying the time to be registered on the ship's log; watch measurement began with the sun reaching its highest point—its [[zenith]]—at midday, which was likewise the essential time reference point for navigation.&lt;ref Name=Bergreen/&gt; At that point in time, the ship's bell was struck eight times; after the first glass had emptied (half an hour), the ship's bell was struck once, after another glass, twice, and so on until four hours after midday, when it was again struck eight times.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; At that point, a new watch began, and the sequence was repeated.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Hence, in the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], there are records that his crew logged the passage of time using a half-hour "ampolleta" (glass) that was turned every time it emptied to keep track of the "canonical" hours.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Likewise, during the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to circumnavigate the globe, 18 hourglasses from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip being authorized by emperor Charles V.&lt;ref name="Hakluyt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pigafetta|title=The First Voyage Around the World, 1519-1522|url=http://www.histo.cat/1/Encomienda-Barna-19-4-1519.jpg|date=1874|publisher=Hakluyt Society Press|isbn=|pages=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ship-log sandglass==

From the 16th century a much smaller 30-second "glass" was used along with the [[chip log]], to measure the speed (in knots) of the vessel over the water. The procedure was as follows:&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=José María Martínez-Hidalgo|title=Enciclopedia general del mar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpLgAAAACAAJ|date=1992|publisher=Garriga|isbn=978-84-7079-090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|

A sailor ran the [[chip log]] and another sailor the sandglass. The slide of the pulled over the stern and let run the first length of line till the quadrant was stabilized in the water. The sailor was leaving to run the line to pass freely leaving the slide by hand and touching the first [[knot (unit)|knot]] sang "mark!" At the moment of the inverted glass and time began to run while the line was counting the knots as they passed until the sandglass sang "mark!" a second blow when they had dropped all the sand, then he caught the firmly the line, measuring the fraction of knot elapsed to the last mark! and cried P.E.: "Five knots and four fathoms!..&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;}}

'''Middleware''' in the context of [[distributed application]]s is [[software]] that provides services beyond those provided by the [[operating system]] to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data. Middleware supports and simplifies complex [[distributed application]]s. It includes [[web server]]s, [[application server]]s, messaging and similar tools that support application development and delivery.  Middleware is especially integral to modern information technology based on [[XML]], [[SOAP]], [[Web service]]s, and [[service-oriented architecture]].

Middleware often enables [[interoperability]] between applications that run on different operating systems, by supplying services so the application can exchange data in a standards-based way. Middleware sits "in the middle" between [[application software]] that may be working on different [[operating system]]s. It is similar to the middle layer of a [[Multitier architecture|three-tier]] single system architecture, except that it is stretched across multiple systems or applications. Examples include [[Enterprise Application Integration|EAI]] software, telecommunications software, [[Transaction Processing System|transaction monitors]], and messaging-and-queueing software.

The distinction between operating system and middleware functionality is, to some extent, arbitrary. While core kernel functionality can only be provided by the operating system itself, some functionality previously provided by separately sold middleware is now integrated in operating systems. A typical example is the [[TCP/IP]] stack for telecommunications, nowadays included in virtually every operating system.

==Definitions==
Software that provides a link between separate software applications. Middleware is sometimes called plumbing because it connects two applications and passes data between them. Middleware allows data contained in one database to be accessed through another.  This definition would fit [[enterprise application integration]] and [[data integration]] software.

ObjectWeb defines middleware as: "The software layer that lies between the [[operating system]] and applications on each side of a distributed computing system in a network."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Sacha|last=Krakowiak|url=http://middleware.objectweb.org/|title=What's middleware?|accessdate=2005-05-06|publisher=ObjectWeb.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507151935/http://middleware.objectweb.org/|archivedate=2005-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== '''Origins''' ==
Middleware is a relatively new addition to the computing landscape. It gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Nick|last=Gall|url=http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/2005/07/update_on_the_o.html|title=Origin of the term ''''|date=July 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also facilitated [[distributed processing]], the connection of multiple applications to create a larger application, usually over a network.

==Use==
Middleware services provide a more functional set of [[application programming interface]]s to allow an application to:
*Locate transparently across the network, thus providing interaction with another service or application
*Filter data to make them friendly usable or public via [[Anonymization#Anonymity on the Internet|anonymization process]] for privacy protection (for example)
*Be independent from network services
*Be reliable and always available
*Add complementary attributes like [[semantics]]
when compared to the operating system and network services.

Middleware offers some unique technological advantages for business and industry.  For example, traditional database systems are usually deployed in closed environments where users access the system only via a [[restricted network]] or [[intranet]] (e.g., an enterprise’s internal network). With the phenomenal growth of the [[World Wide Web]], users can access virtually any database for which they have proper access rights from anywhere in the world.  Middleware addresses the problem of varying levels of [[interoperability]] among different database structures.  Middleware facilitates transparent access to legacy [[database management system]]s (DBMSs) or applications via a [[web server]] without regard to database-specific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, C, Chen, S, Chung, J, Roy-Chowdhury, A, and Srinivasan, V. (1998). Accessing
existing business data from the World Wide Web. IBM Systems Journal, 37(1), 115-132.
Retrieved March 7, 2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 26217517)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses frequently use middleware applications to link information from departmental databases, such as payroll, sales, and accounting, or databases housed in multiple geographic locations.&lt;ref&gt;Bougettaya, A, Malik, Z,  Rezgui, A,  and Korff, L. (2006). A Scalable Middleware for Web
Databases. Journal of Database Management, 17(4), 20-39,41-46.  Retrieved March 7,
2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 1155773301).
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the highly competitive healthcare community, laboratories make extensive use of middleware applications for [[data mining]], [[laboratory information system]] (LIS) backup, and to combine systems during hospital mergers.  Middleware helps bridge the gap between separate LISs in a newly formed healthcare network following a hospital buyout.&lt;ref&gt;Bagwell, H. (2008).

Middleware can help software developers avoid having to write [[application programming interface]]s (API) for every control program, by serving as an independent programming interface for their applications.
For [[Future Internet]] network operation through traffic monitoring in [[Network management|multi-domain scenarios]], using mediator tools (middleware) is a powerful help since they allow [[Telecommunications service provider|operators]], searchers and [[service providers]] to supervise [[Quality of service]] and analyse eventual failures in  [[telecommunication service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kai Oswald Seidler |url=http://www.fp7-moment.eu/ |title=MOMENT |publisher=Fp7-moment.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, e-commerce uses middleware to assist in handling rapid and secure transactions over many different types of computer environments.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, J. (1999). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/2/16523/00762786.pdf Middleware moves to the forefront]{{subscription}}. Technology News. Retrieved March 2,
2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, middleware has become a critical element across a broad range of industries, thanks to its ability to bring together resources across dissimilar networks or computing platforms.

In 2004 members of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) carried out a study of Middleware with respect to system integration in broadcast environments. This involved system design engineering experts from 10 major European broadcasters working over a 12-month period to understand the effect of predominantly software-based products to media production and broadcasting system design techniques. The resulting reports Tech 3300 and Tech 3300s were published and are freely available from the EBU web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3300.pdf |title=EBU middleware report Tech 3300 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3300s.pdf |title=EBU middleware reports Tech 3300s |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Message-oriented middleware===
[[Message-oriented middleware]] (MOM) &lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2004. [http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/1652511/4338215212/cce0f06f047faa57879a1fc36a8e8d6d754d2f6a/dl.pdf "Message-Oriented Middleware"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. {{doi|10.1002/0470862084.ch1}}. {{ISBN|978-0-470-86206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is middleware where transactions or event notifications are delivered between disparate systems or components by way of messages, often via an [[enterprise messaging system]].  With MOM, messages sent to the client are collected and stored until they are acted upon, while the client continues with other processing.

; Enterprise messaging
: An [[enterprise messaging system]] is a type of middleware that facilitates message passing between disparate systems or components in standard formats, often using [[XML]], [[SOAP]] or [[web services]].  As part of an enterprise messaging system, [[message broker]] software may queue, duplicate, translate and deliver messages to disparate systems or components in a messaging system.

; Enterprise service bus
: [[Enterprise service bus]] (ESB) is defined by the [[Burton Group]] &lt;ref name="ms-on-esb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa475433(BTS.10).aspx|title=Microsoft on the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)|date=August 2005|quote=The ESB label simply implies that a product is some type of integration middleware product that supports both MOM and Web services protocols.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "some type of integration middleware product that supports both [[message-oriented middleware]] and [[Web services]]".

===Intelligent middleware===
&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cougaarsoftware.com/files/CSI_ActiveEdge.pdf Choosing the Right Middleware] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121113/http://www.cougaarsoftware.com/files/CSI_ActiveEdge.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;
Intelligent [[Middleware]] (IMW) provides [[real-time intelligence]] and event management through [[intelligent agents]]. The IMW manages the [[real-time processing]] of high volume sensor signals and turns these signals into intelligent and actionable business information. The actionable information is then delivered in end-user power dashboards to individual users or is pushed to systems within or outside the enterprise. It is able to support various heterogeneous types of hardware and software and provides an API for interfacing with external systems. It should have a highly scalable, [[distributed architecture]] which embeds intelligence throughout the network to transform raw data systematically into actionable and relevant knowledge. It can also be packaged with tools to view and manage operations and build advanced network applications most effectively.

==={{Anchor|EMBEDDED}}Content-centric middleware===
Content-centric middleware offers a simple ''provider-consumer'' abstraction through which applications can issue requests for uniquely identified content, without worrying about where or how it is obtained. Juno is one example, which allows applications to generate content requests associated with high-level delivery requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/tysong/files/PhD.pdf Juno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426045143/http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/tysong/files/PhD.pdf |date=2011-04-26 }}, Gareth Tyson, A Middleware Approach to Building Content-Centric Applications. PhD Thesis, Lancaster University (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The middleware then adapts the underlying delivery to access the content from sources that are best suited to matching the requirements. This is therefore similar to [[Publish/subscribe]] middleware, as well as the [[Content-centric networking]] paradigm.

; Remote procedure cal
: [[Remote procedure call]] middleware enables a client to use services running on remote systems.  The process can be [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]] or  [[Asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]].
; Object request broker
: With [[object request broker]] middleware, it is possible for applications to send objects and request services in an object-oriented system.
; SQL-oriented data access
: [[:Category:SQL data access|SQL-oriented Data Access]] is middleware between applications and database servers.
; Embedded middleware
: Embedded middleware provides communication services and software/[[firmware]] integration interface that operates between embedded applications, the embedded operating system, and external applications.

==Vendors==
[[IBM]], [[Red Hat]], [[Oracle Corporation]] and [[Microsoft]] are some of the vendors that provide middleware software. Vendors such as [[Axway]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[TIBCO]], [[Informatica]], [[Objective Interface Systems]], [[Pervasive Software|Pervasive]], ScaleOut Software and [[webMethods]] were specifically founded to provide more niche middleware solutions.  Groups such as the [[Apache Software Foundation]], [[Opensaf|OpenSAF]], the [[ObjectWeb|ObjectWeb Consortium]] (now OW2) and OASIS' [[AMQP]] encourage the development of [[Open-source software|open source]] middleware.  Microsoft .NET "Framework" architecture is essentially "Middleware" with typical middleware functions distributed between the various products, with most inter-computer interaction by industry standards, open APIs or RAND software licence. [[Solace Corporation|Solace]] provides middleware in purpose-built hardware for implementations that may experience scale. [[StormMQ]] provides [[Message Oriented Middleware]] as a service.

The Obukhov length is used to describe the effects of buoyancy on turbulent flows, particularly in the lower tenth of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]].  It was first defined by [[Alexander Obukhov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Mark Z.|title=Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modeling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPwEf-1f73wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obukhov |first1=A.M.|year=1946|title=Turbulence in an atmosphere with a non- uniform temperature.|journal= Tr.

Akad. Nauk SSSR Geofiz. Inst|volume=24|pages=163–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple definition of the Monin-Obukhov length is that height at which turbulence is generated more by buoyancy than by wind shear.

The '''Obukhov length''' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
L = - \frac{u^3_*\bar\theta_v}{kg(\overline {w^'\theta^'_v})_s}\ 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Friction velocity|frictional velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\bar\theta_v&lt;/math&gt; is the mean virtual [[potential temperature]], &lt;math&gt;(\overline{w^'\theta^'_v})_s&lt;/math&gt; is the surface virtual potential temperature flux, k is the [[von Kármán constant]]. The virtual potential temperature flux is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}=\overline {w^'\theta^'}+0.61\overline{T}\; \overline {w^'q^'}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is potential temperature, &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; is absolute temperature and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is specific humidity. 


By this definition, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually negative in the daytime since &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; is typically positive during the daytime over land, positive at night when &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; is typically negative, and becomes infinite at dawn and dusk when &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; passes through zero.

A physical interpretation of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Monin–Obukhov similarity theory]]. During the day &lt;math&gt;-L&lt;/math&gt; is the height at which the buoyant production of [[turbulence kinetic energy]] (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).

'''Mustahabb''' ({{Lang-ar|مستحبّ|lit=recommended}}) is an [[Islamic term]] referring to recommended, favoured or [[virtue|virtuous]] actions.

Mustahabb actions are those whose status of approval in Islamic law (''[[ahkam]]'') falls between ''[[mubah]]'' (neither encouraged nor discouraged) and ''[[wajib]]'' (compulsory). One definition is "duties recommended, but not essential; fulfilment of which is rewarded, though they may be neglected without punishment".&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Levy, ''The Social Structure of Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;202&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms of ''mustahabb'' include ''masnun'' and ''mandub''. The opposite of ''mustahabb'' is ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged).

==Examples==
There are thousands of mustahabb acts,&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Colin|title=Islam: The Basics|publisher=Routledge|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=utxkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Mustahabb+example#v=onepage&amp;q=Mustahabb%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2014|isbn=9781134296910|date=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: 

* [[As-Salamu Alaykum]] (a traditional Islamic [[greeting]],(the islamic greeting is FARD on the believers) Arabic for "peace be upon you") 
* [[Sadaqah]] (charity outside of [[zakat]])
* [[Umrah]]
* two Rakat before Fajr
* tayyitul masjid (two Rakat when entering the mosque); some scholars hold it to be fard due to certain evidences and Allah knows best.
* salatul witr
One must know that mustahabb are acts that increase or bring reward, but there is no sin if left off.

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

{{For|the publication ''Oriens christianus in quatuor patriarchatus digestus''|Michel Le Quien}}
'''''Oriens Christianus''''' is an [[academic journal]] established in 1901 by [[Otto Harrassowitz]] with [[Asian studies|Asian]] and [[oriental studies]] as the major focus.&lt;ref&gt;The original subtitle was "Römische Halbjahr Hefte für die Kunde of christlichen Easts ', which later became simply" Hefte für die Kunde of christlichen Easts'.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;It was founded January 25, 1876 to mark the hundredth anniversary of the birth of writer and Catholic historian Joseph Görres, in his hometown. There has been a Görres Institute in [[Rome]] since 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;It was edited by [[Carl Anton Baumstark|Anton Baumstark]] (1872-1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reviews | author = S. P. Brock | journal = [[The Journal of Theological Studies]] | year = 1973 | volume = XXIV | issue = 1 | pages =237–238 | doi = 10.1093/jts/XXIV.1.237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Hubert Kaufhold ([[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]) and Manfred Kropp ([[University of Mainz]]).


Its domain is the [[Christian East]] excluding [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and Slavic [[Christendom]] (covered by other reviews), that is to say the [[Middle East]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] to [[Ethiopia]], Asian Christian communities and to [[India]] and [[China]]. According to the founder of the program, all elements of the spiritual and material culture of the Christian communities of the East can be addressed. The journal publishes background articles, minutes of reading, but also source-texts in the various languages of Eastern Christendom. Articles can be written in different languages.

The review was led until 1941 (with brief interruptions) by its founder Carl Anton Baumstark, who has published 140 feature articles and 145 book reviews accounts.

[[File:Crimson Red Rhubarb.JPG|thumb|Harvested rhubarb petioles with leaves attached]]

The petiole is a stalk that attaches a leaf to the plant stem. In '''petiolate''' leaves, the leaf stalk (petiole) may be long, as in the leaves of celery and rhubarb, short or completely absent, in which case the blade attaches directly to the stem and is said to be '''sessile'''.  '''Subpetiolate''' leaves are nearly petiolate, or have an extremely short petiole, and may appear sessile.&lt;ref name="Mauseth"/&gt;{{rp|157}} The broomrape family [[Orobanchaceae]] is an example of a family in which the leaves are always sessile.&lt;ref name=Stace&gt;{{cite book|last=Stace|first=C.

A.|year=2010|title=New Flora of the British Isles|edition=Third|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, U.K.| isbn=9780521707725}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|639}}  In some other plant groups, such as the speedwell genus ''[[Veronica (plant)|Veronica]]'', petiolate and sessile leaves may occur in different species.&lt;ref name=Stace /&gt;{{rp|584}}

In the grasses ([[Poaceae]]) the leaves are apetiolate, but the leaf blade may be narrowed at the junction with the leaf sheath to form a ''pseudopetiole'', as in ''[[Pseudosasa japonica]]''.&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book|first=V.H.|last=Heywood|first2=R.K.|last2=Brummitt|first3=A.|last3=Culham|first4=O.|last4=Seberg|year=2007|title= Flowering plant families of the world|publisher=Firefly Books|location=New York|isbn=9781554072064}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|391}}

In plants with [[Leaf#Divisions_of_the_blade|compound leaves]], the leaflets are attached to a continuation of the petiole called the [[Rachis#in botany|rachis]].&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt;{{rp|98}}  Each leaflet may be attached to the rachis by a short stalk called the petiolule.&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt;{{rp|87}}  There may be swollen regions at either end of the petiole known as pulvina (singular=[[pulvinus]])&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt;{{rp|97}} that are composed of a flexible tissue that allows leaf movement. Pulvina are common in the bean family [[Fabaceae]] and the prayer plant family [[Marantaceae]]. A pulvinus on a petiolule is called a pulvinulus. 

In some plants, the petioles are flattened and widened, to become [[Wikt:phyllode|'''phyllodes''' or '''phyllodia''']], or '''cladophylls''' and the true leaves may be reduced or absent.  Thus, the phyllode comes to serve the functions of the leaf.  Phyllodes are common in the genus ''[[Acacia]]'', especially the Australian species, at one time put in ''Acacia'' subgenus ''Phyllodineae''.

[[Image:Acacia koa with phyllode between the branch and the compound leaves.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''[[Acacia koa]]'' with phyllode between the branch and the [[compound leaves]]]]
In ''[[Acacia koa]]'', the phyllodes are leathery and thick, allowing the tree to survive stressful environments.  The petiole allows partially submerged [[hydrophyte]]s to have leaves floating at different depths, the petiole being between the node and the stem.

In plants such as rhubarb (''[[Rheum rhabarbarum]]''), celery (''[[Apium graveolens]]''), [[artichokes]] and [[cardoons]] (''Cynara cardunculus'') the petioles ("stalks" or "ribs") are cultivated as edible crops. The petiole of rhubarb grows directly from the [[rhizome]] and produces the leaf at its end. Botanically it is categorized as a vegetable and culinarily used as a fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foust |first=Clifford M. |title=Rhubarb: The Wondrous Drug |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1992 |isbn=0-691-08747-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.HighAltitudeRhubarb.com High Altitude Rhubarb ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Petiole'' comes from [[Latin]] ''petiolus'', or ''peciolus'' "little foot", "stem", an alternative [[diminutive]] of ''pes'' "foot". The regular diminutive ''pediculus'' is also used for "foot stalk".

The '''Philosophical Gourmet Report''' (also known as the '''Leiter Report''' or '''PGR'''), founded by philosophy and law professor [[Brian Leiter]] and now edited by philosophy professors [[Berit Brogaard]] and Christopher Pynes, is a ranking of graduate programs in philosophy in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnpfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22brian+leiter%22+%22english+speaking+world%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=betnVafZB9WyyASrqIMI&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brian%20leiter%22%20%22english%20speaking%20world%22&amp;f=false|title=A Practical Guide to Electronic Resources in the Humanities|author=Ana Dubnjakovic, Patrick Tomlin|publisher=Elsevier|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/ "The Philosophical Gourmet Report 2014-15"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The "Gourmet" Report ranking was created in response to the [[Gourman Report]], and is based on a survey of philosophers who are nominated as evaluators by the Report's Advisory Board.  Its purpose is to provide guidance to prospective Ph.D students, particularly those students who intend to pursue a professional career in academic philosophy. The Report first appeared on the web in 1996; it has been distributed by [[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell]] since 1997.

In 1989, while he was a graduate student, Leiter made a subjective list of what he believed to be the top 25 graduate philosophy programs in the United States, which came to be the PGR.&lt;ref name=chron1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Peter|title=The Man Who Ranks Philosophy Departments Now Rankles Them, Too|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=September 30, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926193400/http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|archivedate=September 26, 2014|deadurl=no|date=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The PGR was described by [[David L. Kirp]] in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' op-ed as "the bible for prospective [philosophy] graduate students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirp|first1=David|title=How Much for That Professor?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/opinion/27KIRP.html|accessdate=May 28, 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Yancy, in ''Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge'' ([[SUNY Press]], 2012), opined that Philosophical Gourmet Report ranking: "is, of course, very controversial. However, as is often pointed out, there is no real alternative."&lt;ref name=reframe&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eu6BpIDzmkQC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge|author=George Yancy|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlin Romano]], in ''America the Philosophical'' ([[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]], 2013), referred to the PGR rankings as "often-criticized" and "biased towards mainstream analytic departments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUAc6z2uSnAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=America the Philosophical|author=[[Carlin Romano]]|publisher=
Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, 175 philosophers signed an open letter calling on Leiter to stop producing the PGR.&lt;ref name="Mangan 2002"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mangan | first=Katherine S. | title=175 Philosophy Professors Blast Ranking of Graduate Programs | website=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=2002-01-18 | url=http://chronicle.com/article/175-Philosophy-Professors/34484/ | accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2014, over 600 philosophers signed a petition to boycott the PGR. The petition was organized by some philosophers at [[University of British Columbia]] to protest what they called a "derogatory and intimidating" e-mail sent by Leiter to one of their colleagues. Leiter claimed the recipient had threatened him.&lt;ref name=chron1/&gt; 24 of the 56 members of the Advisory Board of the PGR recommended he relinquish control over the Report's management.&lt;ref name=chron1/&gt; In response, Leiter appointed [[Berit Brogaard]], a philosophy professor at the [[University of Miami]], as co-editor for the 2014 report and agreed to step down as editor of subsequent editions.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/controversial-philosopher-will-step-down-as-editor-of-influential-rankings/87797|title=Controversial Philosopher Will Step Down as Editor of Influential Rankings|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=October 10, 2014|author=Andy Thomason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leiter subsequently appointed Christopher Pynes of [[Western Illinois University]] as co-editor of future editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">[[Image:Fiederung.svg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 1''' Pennate muscle fiber arrangements. The green lines represent PCSA; the blue lines represent ACSA]]

In [[muscle]] [[physiology]], '''physiological cross-sectional area''' (PCSA) is the area of the cross section of a [[muscle]] perpendicular to its fibers, generally at its largest point. It is typically used to describe the contraction properties of [[pennate muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/content/abstract/338/1/37 Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA), which is the area of the crossection of a muscle perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. In a non-pennate muscle the fibers are parallel to the longitudinal axis, and therefore PCSA and ACSA coincide.

== Definition ==

One advantage of pennate muscles is that more muscle fibers can be packed in parallel, thus allowing the muscle to produce more force, although the fiber angle to the direction of action means that the maximum force in that direction is somewhat less than the maximum force in the fiber direction.&lt;ref name = Gans&gt;
C. Gans (1982). Fiber architecture and muscle function. Exercise &amp; Sports Science Reviews. 10:160–207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Otten&gt;
E. Otten (1988). Concepts and models of functional architecture in skeletal muscles. Exercise &amp; Sports Science Reviews. 16:89–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscle cross-sectional area (blue line in figure 1, also known as anatomical cross-section area, or ACSA) does not accurately represent the number of muscle fibers in the muscle. A better estimate is provided by the total area of the cross-sections perpendicular to the muscle fibers (green lines in figure 1). This measure is known as the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), and is commonly calculated and defined by the following formula, developed in 1975 by Alexander and Vernon:&lt;ref&gt;
R. McN. Alexander, A. Vernon (1975). The dimension of knee and ankle muscles and the forces they exert, Journal of Human Movement Studies, 1:115–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narici"&gt;
Narici M.V., Landoni L., Minetti A.E. (1992). Assessment of human knee extensor muscles stress from in vivo physiological cross-sectional area and strength measurements. European Journal of Applied Physiology &amp; Occupational Physiology. 65(5):438–444.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maganaris"&gt;
Maganaris C.N., Baltzopoulos V. (2000). In vivo mechanics of maximum isometric muscle contraction in man: Implications for modelling-based estimates of muscle specific tension. In Herzog W. (Ed). Skeletal muscle mechanics: from mechanisms to function. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, p.267-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{PCSA} = {\text{muscle volume} \over \text{fiber length}} = 
                     {\text{muscle mass}   \over {\rho \cdot \text{fiber length}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the density of the muscle: 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = {\text{muscle mass} \over \text{muscle volume}}.&lt;/math&gt;

PCSA increases with pennation angle, and with muscle length. In a pennate muscle, PCSA is always larger than ACSA. In a non-pennate muscle, it coincides with ACSA.

=== Estimating muscle force from PCSA ===
The total force exerted by the fibers in their oblique direction is proportional to PCSA. If the ''specific tension'' of the muscle fibers is known (force exerted by the fibers per unit of PCSA), it can be computed as follows:&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;R.D. Sacks, R.R. Roy (1982). Architecture of The Hind Limb Muscles of Cats: Functional Significance. Journal of Morphology, 185–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Total force} = \text{PCSA} \cdot \text{Specific tension}&lt;/math&gt;

However, only a component of that force can be used to pull the tendon in the desired direction. This component, which is the true ''muscle force'' (also called ''tendon force''&lt;ref name="Maganaris" /&gt;), is exerted along the direction of action of the muscle:&lt;ref name="Maganaris"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Muscle force} = \text{Total force} \cdot \cos \Phi&lt;/math&gt;

The other component, orthogonal to the direction of action of the muscle (Orthogonal force = Total force × sinΦ) is not exerted on the tendon, but simply squeezes the muscle, by pulling its aponeuroses toward each other.

Notice that, although it is practically convenient to compute PCSA based on volume or mass and fiber length, PCSA (and therefore the total fiber force, which is proportional to PCSA) is not proportional to muscle mass or fiber length alone. Namely, the maximum ([[tetanic contraction|tetanic]]) force of a muscle fiber simply depends on its thickness (cross-section area) and [[Skeletal muscle#Muscle fibers|type]]. By no means it depends on its mass or length alone. For instance, when muscle mass increases due to [[Human development (biology)|physical development]] during childhood, this may be only due to an increase in length of the muscle fibers, with no change in fiber thickness (PCSA) or fiber type. In this case, an increase in mass does not produce an increase in force.

Sometimes, the increase in mass is associated with an increase in thickness. Only in this case it will have some effect on fiber force, but this effect will be proportional to the increase in thickness, not to the increase in mass. For instance, in some stages of physical development, the increase in mass may be due to both an increase in PCSA and in fiber length. Even in this case, muscle force does not increase as much as muscle mass does, because the mass increase is partly produced by a variation in fiber length, and fiber length has no effect on muscle force.

== Alternative definition ==
In 1982 a different definition of PCSA, herein denoted PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to facilitate comparison with the previous definition, was introduced by Sacks &amp; Roy:&lt;ref name="Sacks"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{PCSA}_2 = {\text{muscle volume} \cdot \cos \Phi \over \text{fiber length}} = 
                       {\text{muscle mass}   \cdot \cos \Phi \over {\rho \cdot \text{fiber length}}},&lt;/math&gt;

The comparison shows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{PCSA}_2 = \text{PCSA} \cdot \cos \Phi.&lt;/math&gt;

in a pennate muscle, since &lt;math&gt;\cos\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is always smaller than 1, PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always smaller than PCSA. Hence, it cannot be described as the total area of the cross-sections perpendicular to the muscle fibers (green lines in figure 1). It can be interpreted two ways:
# Projection of PCSA (green line in figure 1) on the anatomical cross-section plane (blue line).&lt;ref&gt;This is because the angle between the anatomical and physiological cross-section planes (angle between blue line and green line in figure 1) coincides with &amp;Phi;, by definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ACSA of a non-pennate muscle with the same force as the pennate muscle.&lt;ref&gt;In a non-pennate muscle, ACSA = Muscle force / Specific tension, and Muscle force = PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × Specific tension, hence PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Muscle force / Specific tension = ACSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

This implies that, in a muscle such as that in figure 1A, PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coincides with ACSA. The disadvantage of this definition is its more complex interpretation, its advantage is that muscle force can be computed more directly:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Muscle force} = \text{PCSA}_2 \cdot \text{Specific tension}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Sacks"/&gt;

Currently, some authors keep using the original definition of PCSA,&lt;ref name="Narici" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maganaris" /&gt; probably because of its intuitively appealing geometrical interpretation (figure 1).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22684">{{short description|The relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment}}
'''Polar ecology''' is the relationship between plants and animals in a polar environment. Polar environments are in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. Arctic regions are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it contains land and the islands that surrounds it. [[Antarctica]] is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and it also contains the land mass, surrounding islands and the ocean. [[Polar region]]s also contain the subantarctic and [[subarctic]] zone which separate the polar regions from the [[temperate region]]s. Antarctica and the Arctic lie in the [[polar circle]]s. The polar circles are not visible on the earth but it is shown on maps to be the areas that receives less sunlight due to less radiation. These areas either receive sunlight ([[midnight sun]]) or shade ([[polar night]]) 24 hours a day because of the [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|earth's tilt]]. Plants and animals in the polar regions are able to withstand living in harsh weather conditions but are facing environmental threats that limit their survival.

==Climate==
{{see also|Polar meteorology}}
[[Polar climate]]s are cold, windy and dry. Because of the lack of [[precipitation]] and low temperatures the Arctic and Antarctic are considered the world's largest [[desert]]s or [[Polar desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml The World's Largest Deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ Types of Seserts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[radiation]] from the sun that is received is reflected off the snow making the polar regions cold.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the radiation is reflected, the heat is also reflected. The polar regions reflect 89-90% of the sun radiation that the earth receives.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 24&lt;/ref&gt; And because Antarctica is closer to the sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]], it receives 7% more radiation than the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152724/ Factors affecting surface ultraviolet radiation levels in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the polar region, the atmosphere is thin. Because of this the [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] that gets to the atmosphere can cause fast [[sun tanning]] and [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]].

Polar regions are dry areas; there is very little precipitation due to the cold air. There are some times when the [[humidity]] may be high but the [[water vapor]] present in the air may be low. Wind is also strong in the polar region. [[Wind]] carries snow creating [[blizzard]] like conditions. Winds may also move small organisms or vegetation if it is present.&lt;ref name="stone44"&gt;Stonehouse, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The wind blows the snow making [[snowdrift]]s or snow dunes which may exist even in the spring when the snow is thawing out.&lt;ref name="stone44"/&gt; It is hard for meteorologists to measure the amount of precipitation. This is because it is expensive to take care of the stations that collect weather data and it hard for them to measure snow fall amounts because the wind blows the snow too much to calculate exact amounts.

The temperatures are similar between the Arctic and Antarctic. The temperatures in the Arctic are different depending on the location. Temperatures in the Arctic have a higher range than in the Antarctic. Temperatures can range as much as {{convert|100|C-change|0}}. Along the coast in the Arctic temperatures average {{Convert|-30|to|-40|C}} in December, January and February.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ice melts along the coast during the summer months which are around June, July and August and the temperature may rise a few degrees above freezing causing there to be some vegetation. During these same months in the northern regions there will be 24 hours of daylight. Arctic regions also receive a lot of snowfall. The [[Arctic Basin]] has snow 320 days out of the year while the Arctic Seas have snow cover 260 days a year.&lt;ref name="mel14"/&gt; The thickness of the snow averages {{Convert|30|–|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mel14"&gt;Melnikov, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenland]], temperatures have an average temperature of {{convert|-40|C}} in the winter and in the summer the temperatures reach {{Convert|-12|C}}. Iceland on the other hand is in a subarctic region meaning it is near the temperate zone. Because of this the temperatures are above the freezing point throughout much of the year. In Russia temperatures are extremely cold. In [[Verkhoyansk]], Siberia it has reached the coldest temp of {{Convert|-68.8|C}} in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures in the summer in Siberia can get to {{Convert|36|C}}.

In the Antarctic there is less temperature variations. Temperatures only range by around {{Convert|30|C-change|0}}. The winter months are May till September while the summer months will be October till April. The sun reappears in September which then starts the 24 hours of daylight. The temperatures are different between the plateaus in Antarctica and between the coasts. The plateaus are the coldest regions of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer months there is low precipitation with light winds. [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] has received the lowest temperature worldwide getting as low as {{Convert|-88.3|C}} in 1960. The West Antarctica plateau reaches snow levels of around {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. This area is also warmer but it receives the heaviest snow and receives more wind. Because of the cold desert like conditions on the plateaus there are very little plants and animals. Some species of birds though have been seen.

On the coasts in the summer there is more wind, and it is cloudier. Coasts with higher latitudes have a temperature of {{Convert|-24|C}} in the winter months whereas lower latitude coasts get down to {{Convert|-20|C}}. Coastal areas may receive {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of snow.

==Water==
[[Water]] is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic ice cap]] although a lot of this water is not used.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.

Many of the ponds or lakes in polar regions are frozen over or snow covered for most of the year. Larger lakes thaw out around the edges during the warmer months while the smaller lakes thaw entirely. There are few rivers in the polar regions. The Arctic has more rivers compared to Antarctica. The regions also have ponds. The ponds that attract birds tend to be rich in nutrients. This is because of the bird droppings or bird feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 109&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of lakes in polar regions including Arctic lakes and Antarctic lakes. Of the Arctic lakes they include glacial lakes and permafrost lakes.

The polar regions include the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Arctic Ocean covers {{Convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 127&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring the ice covers an area of {{Convert|5000000|-|8000000|km2|abbr=on}} and in the winter it is twice that. In this area it is never totally ice-covered. This is due to the winds breaking up the ice. Because of these cracks in the ice there is more biological productivity in the ocean.

The Southern Ocean is {{Convert|28000000|km2|abbr=on}}. This ocean contains the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]]. The ocean contains large packs of ice that surrounds Antarctica.

==Land==
Because of the cold weather it is hard for plants to grow. Frozen ground covers most of the polar regions for the majority of the year. [[Permafrost]] reaches a thickness of {{Convert|600|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} deep. Large amounts of permafrost can lead to poor water drainage. Due to the permafrost the water in the soil remains frozen for most of the year. In the summer the top of the permafrost may be covered with water due to melting in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering is also common in polar regions. There is rubble from rocks that are scattered on the land due to movement of [[glacier]]s. Also quick temperature change causes weathering.

The main type of soil in the polar regions is ahumic soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00v6iF3X4gEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Ahumic+soil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2_LbB1b0v&amp;sig=MqeXHlk65XcGD5L-3ubQDNEHAGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kHh1Uo3jHuKbiAK5qoDADg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahumic%20soil&amp;f=false Antarctic Soils and Soil Forming Processes: J. C. F. Tedrow, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the cold desert soil. This soil consists of sand that is frozen. These soils tend to not have a lot of vegetation but [[bacteria]] has been found.

The other type of soil is organic soil. This type of soil is found in areas that are warmer and have more moisture. Some vegetation that lives here are [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[moss]]es. One type of organic soil is the brown soils, which have drainage.

== Animals ==
Due to the harsh weather in the polar regions, there are not many animals. The animals that do exist in the polar region are similar between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The animals do differ by the temperature. In the Arctic some invertebrates include spiders, mites, mosquitoes and flies. In warmer areas of the polar regions moths, butterflies and beetles can be found. Some of the larger animals that exist are foxes, wolves, rabbits, hares, polar bears, [[Reindeer|reindeer/caribou]]. There are various bird species that have been spotted in the Arctic. Eight species of birds reside on the polar [[tundra]] year round while 150 breed in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The birds that do breed go to the Arctic between May and July. One of the known birds is the [[snowy owl]], which has enough fat on it to be able to survive in the cold temperatures.

In the Antarctic some invertebrates that exist are mites, fleas and ticks. Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a land mammal population.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 105&lt;/ref&gt; There are also no birds that reside in Antarctica. Though, it has been known that various birds from South America have been spotted in Antarctica.

For animals to be able to live in the polar region they have to have adaptations which allow them to live in the cold and windy environments. These animals have originated with these adaptations, and animals that live in these regions are accumulating adaptations to be able to live in this type of environment. Some of these adaptations may be to be big and insolated, have a lot of fur, and to be darker. Also, many animals live in groups to be able to protect themselves from the cold. Animals also tend to be [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] which are animals that maintain a high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;177{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller invertebrates also tend to be smaller in polar regions which helps them conserve energy.

There are also many different animals that live in the sea water near polar regions. [[Squid]]s are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 202&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. [[Arctogadus glacialis|Arctic cod]] is a major species in the Arctic. [[Halibut]], [[cod]], [[herring]], and [[Alaska pollock]] (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; there is a lot of the same kind. [[Antarctic silverfish]] and [[lanternfish]] are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pinniped|Seals]] are also found in polar regions and number around 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 206&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to breed on land in the polar regions. [[Whale]]s are also in the polar regions and can be found near the surfaces of water where they prey.

There are also birds that breed in the polar regions. In the Arctic, 95% of the birds breeding here consist of only four different species. These include the [[northern fulmar]], [[kittiwake]], the [[little auk]] and the [[thick-billed murre]]. These birds breed here when the ice starts to thaw and when there is cracks in the ice so the birds are able to feed. In the Antarctic there are two different birds that live there including the [[penguin]] and the [[procellariiformes]].

== Vegetation ==
There is a wide source of vegetation in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, [[lichen]]s, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as {{Convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. In the southern part of the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover. In wet areas of the tundra there is tussock grasses and cotton grasses. In moist areas there are short grasses, mosses, [[willow]]s, and [[birch]]es.

The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be {{Convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, so they provide habitat for many [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}} of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a type of vegetation is a [[crustose]] lichen. These lichens are found in moist areas that are hidden from wind. They hide on the surface of rocks in the cracks. They survive off the water that melts from above. These lichen occur in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], as well as Greenland and IceLand These lichens can be red or orange colored and are known to defoliate rocks.&lt;ref&gt;72 {{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
There exist many threats to the polar regions. One threat is whaling. Whaling started in the 16th century. People hunted whales to sell the meat. By 1925 the number of whales being killed rose from 14,000 to 40,000. The [[International Whaling Commission]] tried to stop whaling in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 192&lt;/ref&gt; but was unsuccessful.

[[Overfishing]] is another threat to the polar regions. In the [[Bering Sea]] there is a lot of fishing due to the high populations of halibut and Alaskan Pollock. Around the 1970s [[krill]] began to become a popular [[crustacean]] to catch. The [[Soviet Union]] started advertising food with krill in it and they started overfishing krill. It has been estimated that 40 tonnes of krill per hour were caught during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[exclusive economic zone]] was established. This said that a certain country can fish {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} off the shore. The country is now able to control who fishes in their EEZ area. But the EEZ has been unsuccessful.

Another threat is [[pollution]]. There are many land and water areas within the polar regions that are contaminated. This can be due to the transport of oil by large ships. [[Siberia]] is one example of a place that has had major pollution in its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion on the [[ozone layer]] is one more threat. An [[ozone hole]] has been detected above Antarctica. The cause of the depletion of the ozone layer is due to [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. The other main reason is due to man made gases that are released into the atmosphere. There are many environmental effects due to this because the gases that are being released five times faster than they are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] is also having effect on the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Global warming is causing the temperature on the earth to increase. In ''Plan B 2.0'' [[Lester R. Brown]] talks about how the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the temperature in the Arctic region has increased by {{Convert|3|-|4|C-change|0}} within the last half century. And with the increase in temperatures some worry that this will cause the sea level to rise. Scientists believe that if the [[Greenland ice sheet]] melts then the sea level could rise by {{Convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The melting of this [[ice sheet]] or others could have an effect on [[ocean current]]s. It could cause lower temperatures in northern North America. Rising of the sea level will also impact coastal areas. One example is in [[Bangladesh]]. If there was a {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}} increase in sea level then millions of people would have to migrate from the coast. Global warming is also affecting Antarctica. The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] or Larsen A is an ice sheet on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The sheet broke in 1995, and then in 2000 an [[iceberg]] that is {{convert|4250|sqmi|abbr=on}} broke off the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Larsen B, which was {{Convert|5500|km2|abbr=on}}, broke off.

Global warming affects plants and animals. For plants, the warmer temperatures induce stress on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand&lt;/ref&gt; For animals, there has been a decrease in the number of [[polar bear]]s in the [[Hudson Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="sti294"/&gt; Since 1981, the polar bear population has been declining. This is because global warming causes the ice to break up faster so the polar bears are going to the coasts when there are poor conditions.&lt;ref name="sti294"&gt;Stirling, 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Whoever owns the land is responsible or managing it. And the owners of the land differ between the Antarctic and Arctic and also within the polar regions. In the Arctic, there are six nations that own the land about 60°N. These nations include: Canada, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[United States|USA]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 193&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Arctic cooperation and politics|international treaties]] set up so there are no disputes. These nations have also have set their government to manage the land properly. They have set up [[national park]]s, [[Wilderness area|land for wilderness]], and also land for research. In the polar regions there have been laws set up to manage the number of visitors. There have been rules set up allowing only a certain amount of mining done and other measures to protect the environment from damages.

In the Antarctic the owners of the land are less clear. Some areas of Antarctica are controlled by the French, while other areas are controlled by [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever owns Antarctic is still unclear therefore many other countries have put out scientific stations. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] of 1961 was established to make sure all the conflicts were resolved about who owned the land. This and other treaties have shown interest in helping to conserve the Antarctic region. All of these countries have conservation laws. These laws manage the amount of hunting in the area, monitor invasive species, and control burning and settlement.

==Still unexplored?==
In a [[meta-analysis]] of the published work in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to still be unexplored. In addition, the north Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and [[Pacific Northwest]]), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world's [[Aquatic biodiversity research|aquatic biodiversity]]. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially [[marine ecosystem]]s where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Polar Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world's aquatic biodiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Pseudoskepticism''' (or '''pseudoscepticism''') is a philosophical or scientific position which appears to be that of [[skepticism]] or [[scientific skepticism]] but which in reality fails to be so.

==Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries==
An early use of the word was in self-denigration: on 31 August 1869, Swiss philosopher [[Henri-Frédéric Amiel]] wrote in his diary:
{{quote|My instinct is in harmony with the pessimism of Buddha and of [[Schopenhauer]]. It is a doubt which never leaves me, even in my moments of religious fervor. Nature is indeed for me a [[Maya (illusion)|Maïa]]; and I look at her, as it were, with the eyes of an artist. My intelligence remains skeptical. What, then, do I believe in? I do not know. And what is it I hope for? It would be difficult to say. Folly! I believe in goodness, and I hope that good will prevail. Deep within this ironical and disappointed being of mine there is a child hidden — a frank, sad, simple creature, who believes in the ideal, in love, in holiness, and all heavenly superstitions. A whole millennium of idyls sleeps in my heart; I am a pseudo-skeptic, a pseudo-scoffer.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dudley Warner, Editor, ''Library Of The World's Best Literature Ancient And Modern, Vol. II'', 1896. Online at Project Gutenberg (e.g. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12788/12788-8.txt here])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It soon acquired its usual meaning where a claimed skeptic is accused of excessive sureness in turning initial doubts into certainties. In 1908 [[Henry Louis Mencken]] wrote on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s criticism of philosopher [[David Strauss]] that:
{{quote|Strauss had been a preacher but had renounced the cloth and set up shop as a critic of Christianity. He had labored with good intentions, no doubt, but the net result of all his smug agnosticism was that his disciples were as self-satisfied, bigoted, and prejudiced in the garb of agnostics as they had been before as Christians. Nietzsche's eye saw this and in the first of his little pamphlets "David Strauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller" ("David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer"), he bore down on Strauss's bourgeoise pseudo-skepticism most savagely. This was 1873.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. (Henry Louis) Mencken, ''The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1908) publ. T.F. Unwin. Reprinted in ''Friedrich Nietzsche'', Originally published: Boston : Luce and Co., 1913. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_r71AzHvf64C&amp;vid=ISBN1560006498&amp;dq=%22pseudo+skepticism%22&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;sig=GmCpU7uH_ZS-fJj_BF8vtbnaHrk&amp;q=%22pseudo+skepticism%22 p.30].&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Frederick L. Will used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in 1942. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] writes:
{{quote|[Frederick] Will was no exception. He began as an analytical philosopher, distinguishing different uses of language with the aim of showing that certain traditional philosophical problems need no longer trouble us, once we have understood how to make the relevant linguistic distinctions. The enemies were two: the philosophical skeptic who poses these false problems and the philosopher who thinks that the skeptic needs to be answered. So in "Is there a Problem of Induction?" (''Journal of Philosophy'', 1942) it is two senses of "know" that are to be distinguished: "All the uneasiness, the pseudo-skepticism and the pseudo-problem of induction, would never appear if it were possible to keep clear that 'know' in the statement that we do not know statements about the future is employed in a very special sense, not at all its ordinary one.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre "[https://eastanglia.academia.edu/KennethRWestphal/Books/8825/F._L._Will_Pragmatism_and_Realism Foreword]" to the book ''Pragmatism and Realism'' by Frederick L. Will (1997) quoting his earlier paper "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2017379 Is There a Problem of Induction?]" ''Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 39, No. 19 (September 10, 1942), pp. 505-513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] Professor of English, John E. Sitter used the term in 1977 in a discussion of [[Alexander Pope]]: "Pope's intent, I believe, is to chasten the reader's skepticism — the pseudo-skepticism of the overly confident 'you' ... "&lt;ref&gt;John E. Sitter, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/450077 The Argument of Pope's Epistle to Cobham]" ''Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900'', Vol. 17, No. 3, Restoration and Eighteenth Century (Summer, 1977), pp. 435-449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truzzi==
In 1987, [[Marcello Truzzi]] revived the term specifically for arguments which use scientific-sounding language to disparage or refute given beliefs, theories, or claims, but which in fact fail to follow the precepts of conventional [[skepticism|scientific skepticism]]. He argued that scientific skepticism is agnostic to new ideas, making no claims about them but waiting for them to satisfy a burden of proof before granting them validity. Pseudoskepticism, by contrast, involves "negative hypotheses"—theoretical assertions that some belief, theory, or claim is factually wrong—without satisfying the burden of proof that such negative theoretical assertions would require.&lt;ref name="truzzi1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Truzzi | first = Marcello | authorlink= Marcello Truzzi | url = http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html | title = On Pseudo-Skepticism | year = 1987 | journal = Zetetic Scholar | issue = 12/13 | pages = 3–4| accessdate = 2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/289894041.html?dids=289894041:289894041&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+15,+2003&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=MARCELLO+TRUZZI+|+Helped+form+the+Committee+for+the+Scientific+Investigation+of+Claims+of+the+Paranormal;+67&amp;pqatl=google "Marcello Truzzi: Helped form the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal"], ''[[The San Diego Union Tribune]]'', February 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/2007-10-11/art-books/marla-vs-pollock-who-s-the-fraudiest/ "Marla vs. Pollock: Who’s the Fraudiest?"] ''[[LA Weekly]]'', October 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2877850/The-plain-truth-about-legal.html "The plain truth about legal truth"] ''[[Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy]]'', January 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, while working as a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Eastern Michigan University]], Truzzi gave the following description of pseudoskeptics in the journal ''Zetetic Scholar'' (which he founded):
{{quotation|In science, the burden of proof falls upon the claimant; and the  more extraordinary a claim, the heavier is the burden of proof demanded. The true skeptic takes an agnostic position, one that says the claim is not proved rather than disproved. He asserts that the claimant has not borne the burden of  proof and that science must continue to build its [[cognitive map]] of reality without incorporating the extraordinary claim as a new "fact." Since the true skeptic does not assert a claim, he has no burden to prove anything. He just goes on using the established theories of "conventional science" as usual. But  if a critic asserts that there is evidence for disproof, that he has a negative hypothesis—saying, for instance, that a seeming [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] [[Experiment|result]] was actually due to an artifact—he is making a claim and therefore also has to bear a burden  of proof...

Both critics and proponents need to learn to think of [[adjudication]] in science as more like that found in the law courts, imperfect and with varying degrees of proof and evidence.  Absolute truth, like absolute justice,  is seldom obtainable. We can only do our best to approximate them.
|Marcello Truzzi|"On Pseudo-Skepticism", ''Zetetic Scholar'', 12/13, pp3-4, 1987&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;}}

Truzzi attributed the following characteristics to pseudoskeptics:&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;
#Denying, when only doubt has been established
#Double standards in the application of criticism
#The tendency to discredit rather than investigate
#Presenting insufficient evidence or proof
#Assuming criticism requires no burden of proof
#Making unsubstantiated counter-claims
#Counter-claims based on plausibility rather than empirical evidence
#Suggesting that unconvincing evidence provides grounds for completely dismissing a claim

He characterized true skepticism as:&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;
#Acceptance of doubt when neither assertion nor denial has been established
#No burden of proof to take an agnostic position
#Agreement that the corpus of established knowledge must be based on what is proved, but recognising its incompleteness
#Even-handedness in requirement for proofs, whatever their implication
#Accepting that a failure of a proof in itself proves nothing
#Continuing examination of the results of experiments even when flaws are found

== Subsequent usage ==
[[Psychiatrist]] Richard Kluft noted that pseudoskepticism can inhibit research progress:
{{quote|".. today genuine skepticism of the benign sort that looks evenly in all directions and encourages the advancement of knowledge seems vanishingly rare. Instead, we find a prevalence of pseudo-skepticism consisting of harsh and invidious skepticism toward one's opponents' points of view and observations, and egregious self-congratulatory confirmatory bias toward one's own stances and findings misrepresented as the earnest and dispassionate pursuit of clinical, scholarly, and scientific truth."&lt;ref&gt;Kluft, Richard P., "Editorial: Building upon our foundations" (June 1994) in [https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/1508 ''Dissociation'', Vol. 7, No. 2, p. 079-080], publ. Ridgeview Institute and the International Society for the Study of Dissociation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Susan Blackmore]], who lost her initial belief in  [[parapsychology]] and in 1991 became a [[CSICOP]] fellow, later described what she termed the "worst kind of pseudoskepticism":
{{quote|There are some members of the skeptics’ groups who clearly believe they know the right answer prior to inquiry. They appear not to be interested in weighing alternatives, investigating strange claims, or trying out psychic experiences or altered states for themselves (heaven forbid!), but only in promoting their own particular belief structure and cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;JE Kennedy, "[http://jeksite.org/psi/jp03.pdf The Capricious, Actively Evasive, Unsustainable Nature of Psi: A Summary and Hypotheses]", ''The Journal of Parapsychology'', Volume 67, pp. 53–74, 2003.

[[Hugo Anthony Meynell]] from the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Calgary]], labels the "extreme position that all significant evidence supporting paranormal phenomena is a result of deception or lies" as pseudoskepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoeber, Hugo Anthony Meynell, ''Critical Reflections on the Paranormal'', SUNY Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7914-3063-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3063-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=c_A_wfFe-CoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Pseudo-skepticism&amp;sig=ACfU3U372C-YJbYhNmNzNYVOmlVA78cnmQ#PPA16,M1 page 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views who he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as "skeptics" despite [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of [[AIDS denial]] are indulging in "bogus scepticism" when they argue in this way.&lt;ref name=Wilson_NS&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2008/09/evidence-sceptic-hiv-bogus Richard Wilson, "Against the Evidence"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 18 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it "centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position".&lt;ref name=Wilson_fooled&gt;Richard C.

The '''Royal Australian Naval Bridging Train''' was a unique unit of the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It was active only during the [[World War I|First World War]], where it served in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]s. The Train was formed in February 1915 and stood down in May 1917. Throughout its existence, it was composed of [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve|Royal Australian Naval Reservists]] under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Leighton Bracegirdle]]. Normally under the command of the [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|British IX Corps]], the Train also supported the [[I ANZAC Corps]] and [[Imperial Camel Corps]] in the defence of the [[Suez Canal]]. {{quote|They were the only Australian naval unit serving in a European theatre of war. They were therefore bent on proving, both to the Royal Navy and to the British Army, that they could overcome any difficulties.&lt;ref name="only naval unit"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=396|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Lt Commander Bracegirdle|Officer Commanding, RAN Bridging Train}} The Train was Australia's most decorated naval unit of the First World War, with more than 20 decorations awarded to its sailors.

==Formation and recruitment==
By 1915, with the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force|prompt seizure]] of [[German colonial empire|Germany's pacific possessions]], it was becoming apparent that there would be very little for the [[Royal Australian Naval Brigade]] to do beyond securing Australia's ports. It was also becoming obvious that [[Trench Warfare]] was going to be the main feature of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and that [[Combat engineers|engineering units]] were in strong demand. Reports reached Australia that the even a Naval contingent would be acceptable, as the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division]], consisting of [[Royal Marines]] and Naval Reservists, was preparing to join the Western Front.
Naval Board was quick to move of these reports, making this recommendation to the Minister for Defence: {{quote|The Naval Board, having consulted the Chief of the General Staff as to most suitable method by which services of [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve|RANR]] officers and men can be made use of in the present war, propose that an offer be made to the Home Government to supply two Bridging Trains, completed to war establishment, the same to be manned by naval ratings drawn mainly from ranks of RANR It is proposed that, while retaining naval ranks and ratings in all other respects, the men comprising these trains should be paid, organised, equipped, and trained under military supervision.&lt;ref name="Official History 382"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=382|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Navy Board recommendation|Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX}}
On 12 February, the Government made the offer to the Imperial Government to provide one Bridging Train, in accordance with "Imperial War Establishments." Within a week, the offer was accepted.&lt;ref name="argus train-offer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1497837 |title=Australia's Aid – Bridging Train Offered – War Office Accepts |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=20 February 1915 |accessdate=17 May 2013 |page=18 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAN-Bridge-Train-staff.jpg|thumb|right|The RANBT Staff circa 1915.]] Command of the Train was given to [[Leighton Seymour Bracegirdle|Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle]], with Lieutenant (later, Commander) Thomas Bond {{post-nominals|country=AUS|DSO|VD|RANR}} as his [[Second-in-command|First Lieutenant]]. Both officers had been involved in the surrender of [[German New Guinea]], Bond had led  the attack on the wireless station, and Bracegirdle had been left in command of the garrison when Commander Beresford was evacuated for medical treatment.&lt;ref name="A Bridging Train"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60751123 |title=A Bridging Train. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 March 1915 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two officers were appointed on 24 February 1915.

The Train grew to 115 men by 12 March and was encamped on [[Kings Domain, Melbourne]]. Bracegirdle and Bond had also discovered that no one left in Australian in either the Army or the Navy had any useful knowledge on the subject of bridging trains, they would have to wait for their pontoons and vehicles to be built – meaning a wait of at least six weeks before they would be able to begin training, and that almost all of their unit would need to be taught to ride, on very few horses.

The Train embarked upon ''HMAT A39 Port MacQuarie'' on 3 June with, according to the Train's Medical Officer, Dr E.W. Morris,&lt;ref name="doc's numbers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59897082 |title=Royal Naval Bridging Train – Chat With Medical Officer|newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=3 February 1917 |accessdate=17 May 2013 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 officers, 3 [[warrant officer]]s, 267 [[Petty Officer]]s and [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]], 26 reinforcements, 412 horses, 5 6-horse pontoons and tressle waggons, and 8 other vehicles. They were headed to Chatham, England to be trained in the construction of pontoons. Of course, this was the First World War. The Train reached [[Port Said|Port Said, Egypt]] on 17 July 1915, and was issued orders to continue on to England. The next day, the 18th, they received orders to [[Dardanelles Campaign|the Dardanelles]]. Arriving at the Greek isle of [[Imbros]], yet more new orders were received, transferring control of the Train from the [[British Admiralty]], which had been given operational control of the Royal Australian Navy by the Federal Government on 10 August 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munro Ferguson|first1=Ronald|title=Proclamation Transferring the Australian Navy to Admiralty Control|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1069929/|website=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[British Army]] and attaching it to [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Army Corps]] under [[Frederick Stopford|Lt. General Stopford]] which was to [[Landing at Suvla Bay|land at Suvla Bay]] on 7 August.

While at Imbros, the Train received a grand total of five days of instruction on the use of their pontoons, a task which needed six days worth of unloading and reloading the equipment. After this minimal training, they were considered ready to land under enemy fire.

==Suvla Bay==
{{main|Landing at Suvla Bay}}
{{cquote|If you want to see their good works you have only to go to Kangaroo Beach, Suvla Bay and look around you. They have made a harbour.}}
[[File:AWM P01326.008 - RAN Bridging Train creating breakwater at Suvla Bay, September 1915.jpg|thumb|The RAN Bridging Train towing into place a hulk to form a breakwater for the boat dock at West Beach, Suvla Bay, Gallipoli, September 1915.]]
At 5am on 6 August 1915, the Train, embarked upon HMAT A53 Itria, reached its designated anchorage, and the landing was well underway. A party was sent ashore to find the best place to continue the landing, and where to later build the infrastructure to reinforce the Corps. Mid-morning, when Bracegirdle attempted to confer with the IX Corps Chief Engineer, Brigadier-General E.H. Bland {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CB|CMG|RE}}, as ordered, but was unable to be found. This forced the Train to sit idle until late afternoon when they were tasked with putting together a temporary pier at A Landing, which had been left without a party to construct it. It was the second day at Suvla when the Train began to come into its own, constructing two piers and rowing the second into place at A Beach, a trip of approximately {{convert |2|mi}}, for use by the lifeboats evacuating injured soldiers. The Train assembled the 110 metre long structure in 20 minutes&lt;ref name="Official History 394"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=394|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next few days were occupied with constructing further piers as well as landing troops and supplies to assist the landing and shifting their base from their landing point to Kangaroo Beach.

Soon, the Train was put in charge of the landing's water supply, something that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside.&lt;ref name="Official History 394"/&gt; This was just some of the work that saw the Train removed from the [[11th (Northern) Division|11th Division]] and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.

{{quote|The principal duties allotted to the unit by the Royal Navy were as follows: Water supply, care of landing-piers, discharging of stores from store-ships and transports, lighterage of same to the shore, salving of lighters and steamboats wrecked during gales, assisting in salving of T.B.D. ''Louis'', disembarking of troops with their baggage on all beaches, and of munitions and stores. ... &lt;br&gt; The duties allotted to the unit by the [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] the IX Army Corps were briefly as follows : Control and issue of all engineer and trench stores and materials, care and issue of trench bombs and demolition stores (for some weeks after landing, and until proper ordnance dumps were established), erection of high-explosive magazines, dug-outs, cookhouses, and galleys, assembly of hospital huttings, construction of iron frames for front-line wire entanglements; and the manning and control of the steam-tug ''Daphne''.&lt;ref name="Official History 395"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=395|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Lt Commander Bracegirdle|Officer Commanding, RAN Bridging Train}}  Other jobs that fell to the Train to were to act as wireless operators and draughtsmen for the Army Corps and Lt Commander Bracegirdle was the "Beachmaster" of Kangaroo Beach.

[[File:AWM P01326.006 - Turkish shell lands beside a pier, Suvla Bay, October 1915.jpg|thumb|A heavy Turkish shell lands beside a pier constructed by the RAN Bridging Train, Suvla Bay, Gallipoli, October 1915.]]
According to the Train's log, 30 September was a special day. It was the second day in a row that the base had not been shelled by Turkish artillery. Of course, they would make up for the oversight on 1 October, but for the sailors it was a welcome reprieve.&lt;ref name="Official History 395"/&gt; While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where they at least had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.

The AIF Official War Correspondent, Charles Bean came to Suvla Bay specifically to report on the Train, where he found that: {{quote|There they are to-day, in charge of the landing of a great part of the stores of a British army. They are quite cut off from their own force; they scarcely come into the category of the Australian Force, and scarcely into that of the British; they are scarcely army and scarcely navy. Who it is that looks after their special interests, and which is the authority that has the power of recognising any good work that they have done, I do not know. If you want to see the work, you have only to go to Kangaroo Beach, Suvla Bay, and look about you. They have made a harbour.&lt;ref name="Makers of Harbour"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10440600 |title=The Makers of a Harbour|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=28 December 1915 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Charles Bean|The Hobart Mercury, December 28, 1915}}

The supplies landed and distributed by the Train were many and varied.

===Evacuation===
{{main|Allied evacuation of Gallipoli}}
In November 1915, the British military hero [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Lord Kitchener]] toured the Dardanelles as part of his review of the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre of operations]]. After two hours at Anzac Cove, he instructed Lt General Birdwood, the Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to begin planning to evacuate the Peninsula. Winter was coming and already too many soldiers were being taken sick and even dying of hypothermia and frostbite, while the Turks had been stubbornly holding their ground. Retreat made sense, aside from just one problem: once the Turks figured out the troops were pulling back, the retreat would very quickly become a bloodbath.

Once the official decision was made by the War Cabinet, preparations were made, carefully disguised to make it seem as though units that could be would be withdrawn to [[Mudros]] safely would be, leaving enough troops to defend the ground taken for the winter, while the bulk of the troops would return in spring for a new offensive. Troops and equipment started slipping away from the front and aboard navy vessels from 8 December 1915.&lt;ref name="evac start"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bean|first=Charles|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume II|page=863|year=1924|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time, the Train's log shows work parties completion construction of roads and buildings on the same day as other parties were disassembling other buildings and stocking supplies for transport, with shifts working around the clock. The sick list came down from 70 men before preparations began to a low of 7 on 12 December. The Chief Engineer of IX Corps, General Bland praised the Train for its work in preparing to depart Suvla, saying that

{{quote|From the time the 1st R.A.N.B.T. joined the IX Corps all ranks have worked hard, cheerfully, and well. They have rendered most valuable services in connection with the construction and maintenance of landing-piers, beach water-supply, and the landing, charge of, and distribution of engineer material at Suvla, and have most willingly given their help in many other directions. Their work has been continuously heavy, and they have done it well.&lt;ref name="Official History 397"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=397|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A fine example of endurance, good organisation, and discipline. Their commanders were indefatigable in anticipating requirements, and assisting whenever and where ever required. I bring them to your notice as two specially valuable and well-commanded units, which can be relied upon to do their best under difficult circumstances.&lt;ref name="Official History 398"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=398|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Brigadier-General E.H. Bland {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CB|CMG|RE}}, Chief Engineer IX Corps|''Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX''}}

The Train was the last Australian unit to leave the Gallipoli Peninsula, a party of 50 men under Sub-Lieutenant Charles Hicks was left behind to oversee the evacuation of the British forces. They left at 4.30am, on 28 December – eight days after the evacuation of [[Anzac Cove]]. The Train sailed to the Greek isle of [[Mudros]], along with the rest of IX Corps.

==Suez Canal==
{{No. 2 Section, Suez Canal}}

On reaching Mudros, Lt Commander Bracegirdle was hospitalised for Malaria and Jaundice, while command of the Train was returned to the [[11th (Northern) Division|11th Division]]  from IX Corps. The Train was then temporarily transferred, on 26 December 1915, to the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]]. Disciplinary matters, though were handled by [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss]], the Royal Navy officer commanding the [[Moudros|Port of Moudros]]. By 5 February 1916, the transfer to [[I ANZAC Corps]] was official.&lt;ref name="Official History 398"/&gt;

After recuperating at [[Mudros]], the Train set sail under command of Lt. Bond for [[Lake Timsah]] on the [[Suez Canal]] on 17 January, arriving there on the 21st. Here, at Suez Canal No. 2 Section, the Train was responsible for manning and controlling existing bridges, building new bridges, control of tugboats and lighters and the distribution of stores. On 11 February, the Train split into three sections, with Lt. Bond commanding 57 men at a [[Serapeum]] halfway between Lake Tismah and Bitter Lakes, Sub-Lieutenant Charles Hicks with 65 men at the northern approach to Lake Tismah, a place known as Ferry Point. Lt Commander Bracegirdle had joined up with the Train again on 30 January, and was in command at the main camp on Lake Tismah.

Duties at the main camp were light, mainly consisting of experimenting with new iron pontoons, and assisting at the [[Ismaïlia]] Canal Works. The two detachments on the other hand were used to operate the small vessels crossing the Canal at all hours of the day and night, and also forming and breaking the pontoon bridges several times each day.

Come March, the Train was in high demand. Admiral Wemyss, now in command of [[East Indies Station|East Indies &amp; Egyptian Squadron]],&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to use the Train to operate river transports and work as gun crews supporting the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|General Sir Julian Byng]], who had taken command of [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] at Suvla Bay when the elderly [[Frederick Stopford|General Frederick Stopford]] was relieved for incompetence, wanted to bring the Train south to No. 4 Section, Suez Canal, which included all of the Canal south of Small Bitter Lake. Also in March, Lieutenant Bond was transferred to the [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence]] detachment in [[Alexandria]], with Lt Clarence Read&lt;ref name="RAN List"&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplement to the Navy List, 1 October 1916|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1916-Supp.pdf|publisher=Australian Government Printer|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking his place as First Lieutenant.

{{No. 4 Section, Suez Canal}}
Byng got his way, and the Train arrived in [[Suez]] on 4 May. No.4 Section was the largest of the Canal's divisions, and the Train's responsibilities increased when they arrived. As well as manning bridges and small vessels, building brides, they were now building wharves and piers, controlling tugboats and all military traffic crossing the Canal and constructing pumping machinery IX Corps knew what the Train was capable of and made sure that they got the most out of the Train they could. On the other hand, though, the weather conditions were harsher than they had been up at No. 2 Section, and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman troops]] were more active in their attempts at sabotage and air raids were common.

The Train's HQ was set up at Kubri West, with a major detachment at Shallufa, and parties also working at Geneffe, Gurka Post, Baluchi Post, [[El Shatt]], the town of [[Suez]], [[Port Tewfik]] and the Canal Quarantine Station, on the [[Gulf of Suez]].&lt;ref name="Official History 400"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|page=400|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Allied forces were working to push the Ottoman Troops back from the Canal and deep into the desert. To get their supplies in, it was decided that a railway would be built by the engineers. There was however a slight problem. There was no way to get the locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new [[wharves]] to unload the locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating [[pile driver]]s.

Despite the best efforts of the railway engineers, by the time of the [[Battle of Magdhaba]], the tracks were still {{convert|25|mi}} from the town of El Arish, so the Train was called in to manage the landing of supplies on the beach. Unfortunately, the whole bight was [[naval mine|mined]] and the Royal Navy would be unable to [[Demining|sweep]] it without raising suspicions. The Train's mission was therefore to land on the beach and then construct two piers through the minefield.

Little action was actually seen as the Turks slipped out of El Arish, apparently getting wind of the attack a day before the Train landed. But it was one of the few times that the Train supported other Australian forces in combat, the [[Imperial Camel Corps]] and [[Australian Light Horse]] under General [[Harry Chauvel|Sir Harry Chauvel]] were both involved in the Battle. However, this was the last real action that the Train saw before being disbanded.

==Disbandment==
By the end of 1916, when Lieutenant Cameron was appointed First Lieutenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60470612 |title=Naval Bridging Officer's Return. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=18 July 1917 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; new members who had not served under fire started to complain that they were being used for simple work that could be done by the [[Egyptian Labour Corps|Egyptian labourers]]. Word of this eventually reached the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Defence Department]] who soon wrote to the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Commonwealth Naval Board]], which said that the men of the train "would be unsuitable for use aboard [[Her Majesty's Australian Ship|HMA Ships]]; if no longer required as a Bridging Train, the unit should be disbanded, and its members seither sent as reinforcements to the Australian Engineers or Artillery, or brought back to Australia."&lt;ref name="Official History 610"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jose|first=Arthur|title=Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|year=1928|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra|page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the Defence Department took the matter to the [[War Office]], where [[Archibald Murray|General Archibald Murray]], the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force|General Officer Commanding Egypt]] made his opinion that the Train was engaged in "work of an important military nature" &lt;ref name="Official History 610"/&gt;

Lt Commander Bracegirdle was informed at the start of January 1917 that the Train would be relieved of it duties on the Canal and get back into the War, heading deeper into Palestine. The Train then spent January preparing for their new mission, only to be informed that only part of the unit would be required for the duties in Palestine on 8 February 1917. He was also instructed to find out how his men could be redistributed. 76 indicated they would be willing to transfer to the [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]], 43 to the [[Royal Navy]], while the remainder wished to stay with the Train.

After this, on 18 February, the War Office sent the Defence Department another telegram on the matter, which does not reflect the outcome of Bracegirdle's survey at all: {{quote|Recommend that personnel of Australian Naval Bridging Train be transferred to Australian army, with exception of 4 officers and 80 other ratings who will be retained in unit reorganised in two sections – one consisting of skilled engineers and kindred trades, and one of expert pier-builders and shore-workers. Personnel transferred to Australian army would be posted to whichever arm they are best suited. Anyone not accepting transfer to be discharged and returned to Australia|War Office Telegram|Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, Volume IX|}} Nonetheless, the Australian Government accepted the [[War Office]]'s recommendation. On the same day, Lt Commander Bracegirdle was relieved of command and appointed Officer Commanding Troops aboard the transport [[SS Willochra]], 5 March 1917.

On 20 March, the Train was informed that they were being disbanded and were asked to make a choice as to their next assignment. The results were very clear, the vast majority of members choosing to remain with the Royal Australian Navy.

194 Officers and Ratings embarked on the troopship [[HMAT A45 Bulla]] on 26 May 1917 and arrived at Melbourne on 10 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swinden|first=Greg|title=The Royal Australian Navy Bridging Train|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/royal-australian-naval-bridging-train|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then returned to their State of origin and discharged by 22 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1635148 |title=Disbanded Bridging Train. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=12 July 1917 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bean's Official History states that this came about through a series of miscommunications between the [[War Office]], [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Commonwealth Naval Board]] and the Train itself, and that several months later, in July 1917, it was decided to reform the Train, but its members had dispersed too far to be recalled.

During its existence, the Train had made two amphibious landings ([[Gallipoli]] and [[El Arish]]), and lost 25 sailors killed. Lieutenant Commander Bracegirdle was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Mentioned in Despatches]] three times for his command of the Train, while 16 of his men were also Mentioned in Despatches.

The '''shorthand for the orchestration''' of a classical [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] (and other similar ensembles), or Orchestra Instrumentation Numerical Notation, is used to outline which and how many [[musical instrument|instruments]], especially [[wind instrument]]s, are called for in a given piece of music. The shorthand is ordered in the same fashion as the parts of the individual instruments in the [[sheet music#Full scores, variants and condensations|score]], read from top to bottom.

==General approach==

The orchestra is divided into four groups and specified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://desatheory.janetpeachey.com/Orchestral%20Instruments.html The Order of Instruments in an Orchestral Score, Music Theory Website at Duke Ellington School of the Arts] Accessed 27 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Woodwind instrument]]s: [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s
* [[Brass instrument]]s: [[French horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]]s
* [[Timpani]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[harp]], [[piano]] etc.
* [[String section]]: [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[Double bass|basses]], frequently abbreviated to 'str', 'strs' or similar.

: The relations of the individual sections within the strings has been kept since the classical period for acoustical reasons, so a small string section could be 10/8/6/5/4; an example is given for a much larger orchestra in the table below.

If any soloists or a choir are called for, their parts are usually printed between the percussion/keyboards and the strings in the score. In shorthand however, they are usually omitted.

==Degree of standardisation==

The basic order of the instruments, as seen above, is common to all of the shorthand systems. However, there is no standardized version of this shorthand; different publishers and librarians use different systems, especially for doubling/alternate/additional instruments. David Daniels, in earlier versions of his seminal work gathering in print a catalogue of the orchestrations of some 4,000+ pieces,&lt;ref&gt;David Daniels: Orchestral Music A Handbook, Pub. (USA) Scarecrow Press, Inc, Lanham, Maryland, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8108-3228-3}} (3rd Ed.), cf. 2nd Ed. {{ISBN|0-8108-1484-6}} and 1st Ed. {{ISBN|0-8108-0537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; made use of a shorthand for doubling/alternate/additional instruments which was less clear, but in the newer online version&lt;ref&gt;[https://daniels-orchestral.com/about/this-online-tool/ Description of the online tool at daniels-orchestral.com] Retrieved 18 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Daniels' approach has been refined to something more explicit, akin to the Chester Novello and Boosey &amp; Hawkes notations below.

Examples for different notations for the same orchestration:

Silt fences are widely used on construction sites in North America and elsewhere, due to their low cost and simple design.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, C.J. (1999). "Assuring the Effectiveness of Silt Fences and Other Sediment Barriers." Proceedings of Conference 30, International Erosion Control Association, Nashville, TN. pp. 133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their effectiveness in controlling sediment can be limited, due to problems with poor installation, proper placement, and/or inadequate maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brzozowski |first1=Carol |date=Nov–Dec 2006 |title=Silt Fence Installation |journal=Erosion Control |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |doi= |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/soil/erosion-control-devices/silt-fence-installation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and installation==
Silt fences are often perimeter controls, typically used in combination with [[sediment basin]]s and [[sediment trap (construction)|sediment trap]]s, as well as [[erosion control]]s, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., [[land grading]] and other [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%202.pdf |publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ) |location=Richmond, VA |chapter=Chapter 2. Erosion and Sediment Control Principles, Practices and Costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Silt fence installed on a construction site]]
[[File:Silt fence &amp; chain link support.png|thumb|Chain link supported "super" silt fence]]
A typical fence consists of a piece of [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] filter fabric (also called a [[geotextile]]) stretched between a series of wooden or metal fence stakes along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched "spoil" from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur. Water can seep through the silt fence fabric, but the fabric often becomes "blocked off" with fine soil particles (all sediment-retention devices have this challenge, and none of them "filter" storm water for very long).{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be "disturbed" in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the silt fence to the top of the structure; requiring another silt fence above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the silt fence to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%203%20-%203.05.pdf |publisher=VA DEQ |section=Spec. 3-05.

Sediment is captured by silt fences primarily through ponding of water and settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.&lt;ref name="Fifield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Designing for Effective Sediment and Erosion Control for Construction Sites |last=Fifield |first=Jerald S. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Forester Press |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-0-9707687-3-5 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.6–9}} &lt;ref name="EPA DD"&gt;{{Cite report |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Guidelines and Standards for the Construction and Development Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/construction-and-development-effluent-guidelines-documents |author=EPA |year=2009 |id=EPA-821-R-09-010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

===Super silt fence===
Some government jurisdictions in the [[United States]] recommend or require the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a "super" silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites.  This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or [[chain link fence]]. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1994 |title=1994 Maryland Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control |url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/sedimentstormwater/1994ErosionSed_Section_H.pdf |section=Section H - 26.0: Super Silt Fences |publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment |location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the filter fabric becomes clogged.  This typically causes flooding and increased downstream [[water pollution|pollution]]. Most super silt fence specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which has been shown to be highly susceptible to "washing out" under the fabric due to improper back-filling and inadequate compaction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
{{clear}}
[[File:Static slicing machine.png|thumb|Static slicing machine]]
===Static slicing installation===
Some [[U.S. state|state]] agencies recommend an installation technique called "static slicing" as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a silt fence system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade into the soil with a wedge-type point on its tip to slightly disrupt the soil upward, while simultaneously inserting the silt fence fabric into the slot with a moving pivot, while the machine is moving forward. This step is followed by mechanical [[soil compaction]], setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.&lt;ref name="EPAsilt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carpenter |first1=Thomas |last2=Sprague |first2=Joel |date=Jul–Aug 2002 |title=Silt Fence Installation Efficacy |journal=Grading and Excavation Contractor |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/construction/silt-fence-installation-efficacy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

Silt fence fabrics (geotextiles) tested in laboratory settings have shown to be effective at trapping sediment particles.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{Cite report |title="An Evaluation of the Use and Effectiveness of Temporary Sediment Controls" |url=ftp://ftp.odot.state.or.us/techserv/Geo-Environmental/Environmental/Regulatory%20Documentation%20Forms%20and%20Examples/Water%20Quality/Research%20Technical%20Documents/Barrett%20et%20al%201996.pdf |last1=Barrett |first1=Michael E. |last2=Kearney |first2=John E. |last3=McCoy |first3=Terry G. |last4=Malina |first4=Joseph F., Jr. |last5=Charbeneau |first5=Randall J. |date=March 1996  |publisher=University of Texas at Austin, Center for Transportation Research |id=Research Report 1943-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–47}} Although there have been few field tests of silt fences installed at construction sites, these tests have shown generally poor results.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|27–31, 53–55}} (Effectiveness testing involved measurements for both [[total suspended solids]] and [[turbidity]].) Other studies and articles about silt fence usage and practice document problems with installation and maintenance, implying poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Stevens |first1=Ellen |last2=Barfield |first2=Billy J. |last3=Britton |first3=S.L. |last4=Hayes |first4=J.S. |date=2004 |title=Filter Fence Design Aid for Sediment Control at Construction Sites |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000D1LT.txt |publisher=EPA |page=22 |id=EPA/600/R-04/185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, static slicing the material into the ground has proven to be the most efficient and most effective installation method because slicing maintains the soil on both sides of the fence, and is conducive to proper compaction—which is critical to performance, as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2000 the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) co-sponsored silt fence efficacy field research through its Environmental Technology Verification Program, and in general, the report found the static slicing method to be highly effective, and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2001 |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report for Installation of Silt Fence Using the Tommy® Static Slicing Method |url=https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/pdf/08_vs_tommy.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Environmental Technology Evaluation Center (EvTEC); Civil Engineering Research Foundation |page= |isbn=0-7844-0565-4}} CERF Report No 40565.&lt;/ref&gt; Silt fence effectiveness is best determined by how many hundreds of pounds of sediment are contained behind a given silt fence after a storm event, and not turbidity, etc. as sediment-retention is the end goal, and not a water-quality measurement used in erosion control, for instance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
 
Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence where it will not pond runoff water), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance—fabric falling off of the posts, or posts knocked down.  A silt fence top-full of sediment may need maintenance/replacement, but it is a huge success.&lt;ref name="Fifield" /&gt;{{rp|p.6–10}} The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a silt fence may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a silt fence under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures when the installation is not adequately back-filled and properly compacted, and/or the post-spacing is inadequate.&lt;ref name="EPA DD" /&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Stichomythia''' (Greek: Στιχομυθία) is a technique in [[verse drama]] in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://roberthogan.net/books/antilabe-rebuilt.pdf], Antilabe Rebuilt by Robert Hogan.&lt;/ref&gt;) or two-line speeches (distichomythia&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Die stichomythie in der griechischen tragödie und komödie:
ihre anwendung und ihr ursprung by Adolf Gross (German).&lt;/ref&gt;) are given to alternating [[Character (arts)|characters]]. It typically features repetition and [[antithesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Lesley, ed. | title = New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 3056 | isbn = 0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated in the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]], though many dramatists since have used the technique. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] it derives from the Greek ''stikhos'' ("row, line of verse") + ''muthos'' ("speech, talk").&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford"&gt;Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition Revised&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of [[Dialogue (fiction)|dramatic dialogue]] where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama.&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford" /&gt; Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:bwNarlyOkSgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MgIQT8LiNobqtgfDn9T5AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=editions%3AbwNarlyOkSgC&amp;f=false], Studies in stichomythia by J. Leonard Hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally&lt;ref name="usu.edu"&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/131romtheatre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name="selu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/cfrederic/TheatreHistoryThruRenaissance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

Modern theatre rarely uses verse,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/nov/11/plays-verse-missing-stage | work=The Guardian | first=Raymond | last=Blankenhorn | title=Plays in verse were all the rage, but why are they missing from the stage? | date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.&lt;ref name="Hogan" /&gt;

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R. C. Jebb]]'s translation of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'': the scene is an argument between [[Ismene]] and her sister [[Antigone]].
For further examples from ''Antigone'', consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISMENE:  And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===
''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Act I, scene ii.  [[Richard III of England|Richard Plantagenet]], [[Earl of Gloucester]] (later [[Richard III of England]]) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LADY ANNE:  I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  'Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUEEN:   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN:   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Merchant of Venice", Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which "catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SHYLOCK:  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further intensification is often achieved by [[antilabe]], in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange  in ''[[Le Cid]]'' (1.3.215–226), by [[Pierre Corneille]], has been called "an excellent instance of Corneille's skilful handling of 'stichomythia'".&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1918, p. 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (''le Comte'') wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas!  Moi?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE:                      Vous.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE:                                  Ton impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Téméraire viellard, aura son récompense.  [''Il lui donne un soufflet''
&lt;ref&gt;
COUNT: What I deserved, you carried away.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who won it over you had deserved it more.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: He who can exercise it best is the most worthy.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: To be refused it is not a good sign.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: You had it by intrigue, being an old courtier.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The luster of my high deeds was my only supporter.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Let's speak better, the King does honor to your age.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The King, when he does it, measures it according to courage.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: And by that the honor was owed to my arm only.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who could not obtain it did not deserve it.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Did not deserve it!  I?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO:                      You.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT:                                  Your impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Rash old man, will have its reward.  [''He slaps him'']
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Musical drama===
In the scene in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[libretto]] by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (''Sua madre?'', that is, "his mother?") to each character and is reassured in the same words.  A critic has called that "the merriest and most congenial form imaginable" of stichomythia.&lt;ref&gt;Knepler (1997, p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt;  For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by [[Andrea Maffei]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[I masnadieri]]'' has been called "musical stichomythia",&lt;ref&gt;Budden (1992, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?&lt;ref&gt;AMALIA: Which sea, which land divided you from me?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Oh, unhappy woman, end the cruel inquiry!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: False news said you were dead.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Happy were I if shut in the tomb!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Did you, O my Carlo, feel the torment?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: May your heart never know it!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: I too, lonely, cried for you many years.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Then for me an angel dared weep?
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples from [[Musical theatre|musical]]s are "I Remember it Well" (lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], first version in the Broadway musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', second in the film ''[[Gigi]]'') and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" (by [[Irving Berlin]], from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'').  Another is from "The Last Supper" in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus: Why don't you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they're waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don't care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a "witty exchange of one-liners" and associated with the [[film noir]] characters  Jeff Bailey in ''[[Out of the Past]]'', [[Sam Spade]], and [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2008, p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Another film-noir example is in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (dialog by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]]). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,
      if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I'd say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn't take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12208">'''Suzanne Césaire''' [née Roussi] (11 August 1915 – 16 May 1966), born in [[Martinique]], and was a writer, teacher, scholar, anti-colonial and feminist activist, and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]].

==Early life==
Suzanne Césaire (née Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (née William), a school teacher, and Benoït Roussi, a sugar factory worker.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her education at her local primary school in Rivière-Salée in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls’ boarding school in the capital, Fort-de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.

==University and marriage to Aimé Césaire==

During her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who introduced her to [[Aimé Césaire]], a fellow student at the École normale supérieure.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]''. In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.

==Literary career==
Suzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal ''Tropiques'', of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and [[René Ménil]], both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.

While her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology ''The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean'' (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.

Césaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:

“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with [[André Breton]] following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Blachère, “Breton et Césaire: Flux et reflux d’une amitié”, Europe, Paris, vol. 76, iss. 832, 1998, pp. 146-159 (p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of [[Afro-Surrealism]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Rosemont, ''Surrealist Women'' (2000) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of ''Tropiques'' can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. ''Tropiques'' was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of ''Tropiques'' towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of ''Tropiques'', published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nouvelleseditionsplace.com/produit/tropiques/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropiques'' published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientbookline/service/reference.asp?output=PORTAL&amp;INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP&amp;DOCID=0467910&lt;/ref&gt; With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

Suzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of ''Tropiques'', she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed "Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]
Her encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - "La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]

'''The Spoils of War (symposium)'''
[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
"The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property" was a ground-breaking international [[symposium]] held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the "[[Lieber Code]]" of 1863 and the "[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]," and continue with the treaties following World War I, the "[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The "Monuments Men"==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|"Monuments Men"]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Treasure of Priam," which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of "Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War":

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The "Spoils of War" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the "Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of "[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

The '''University of Santo Tomas College of Education''', popularly known as '''"UST-Educ"''', is the teacher education, nutrition and dietetics, food technology, and library and information science school of the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest and the largest [[Catholic]] university in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It was established in 1926 at [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]].

On June 2, 2008, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs of the College were proclaimed '''Center of Excellence (COE)''' in [[Education]] by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]. Likewise, the Department of Education designated it as a '''Center of Training (COT)'''

The different degree programs of the College are accredited by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). In the academic year 2011-2012, the BSEd and BEEd programs have been granted '''Level III''' accreditation status. In 2013, the BSFT and BSND programs have been granted '''Level III ''' re-accredited status. The BLIS program has also been granted '''Candidate ''' accreditation status last academic year 2014-2015.

The College is a top performing school in the board examinations for teachers, nutritionist-dietitians and librarians.

==History of the College==
The U.S.T. College of Education was founded in June 1926 during the rectorate of Very Rev. Fr. Manuel Arellano, O.P. Classes at the college commenced in Intramuros, Manila. It offered the four-year Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.) degree.

In 1940, the normal school was established and offered a two-year course leading to Elementary Teachers Certificate (E.T.C.). In 1941, the Elementary Training Department was opened as a laboratory school of the College of Education. In 1953, the degree Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (B.S.H.E.) was offered. In June 1954, the Elementary Teachers Certificate was changed into a four-year degree called Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. From 1955-1957, a new major in Food and Nutrition was added; and later transformed into Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition (B.S.F.N.).

In the school year 1970-71, the Institute of Nutrition was established as an independent body from the College of Education under the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs. Another significant event in 1971 was the merging of the Normal School with the College of Education due to the decreasing enrollment rate of the former. In July 1971, a Special Assistant to the Dean was created to take charge of the Normal elementary School since the Directress and the Secretary of the School positions were abolished.

From 1974-1976, the College offered new major studies in Chemistry and in School Guidance &amp; Character Education. The latter major replaced the co-major in Theology. The College introduced the following terminal courses to meet the demands for manpower: Certificate in Practical Arts (2 years),Certificate in Practical Dietetics (2 years) and Tourist Guide Certificate (1 year). The two former courses/programs were later on phased out while the Tourist Guide Certificate was changed into Associate in Tourism (2 years).

In the 1980s, the College of Education phased out all vocational courses/programs and the Institute of Nutrition was abolished. Later on, the College offered the following four-year degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Bachelor of Science in Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management.

From 1990-1992, new majors for the Bachelor of Secondary Education program were offered: Computer Technology Education; Home Management and Vocational Technology (which replaced Home Economics); and Values Education (which replaced the Guidance and Character Education). The Early Childhood Education was also introduced as a new major for the Bachelor of Elementary Education program.

In the School Year 2006-07, the B.S. Tourism and B.S. Hotel and Restaurant Management programs were transferred into a newly established body of the University - the Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management (I.T.H.M.). The I.T.H.M. was later renamed as College of Tourism and Hospitality Management.

In 2004, the College collaborated with Hanyang University (South Korea) for a student-exchange program.

In 2007, the College was the second top performing school in the nutrition-dietetics board exam with a passing rate of 80%, higher than the national passing rate of 56.40%. Four Thomasians entered the Top Ten Examinees of the said P.R.C. examination.

In the April 2008 Licensure Examination for Teachers (Secondary Level), the College was the second top performing school with a high 95% passing rate. Two Thomasian BSEd alumni entered the Top Ten Examinees' list.

In the school year 2008-09, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs have been granted the Center of Excellence (COE) status after undergoing the stringent evaluation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd). The COE status lasted from June 2, 2008 until June 2, 2011.

In 2008, the Department of Education (DepEd) designated the College as a Center of Training (COT) in MAPEH. Since then, DepEd and U.S.T. College of Education have been collaborating for the annual Teacher Induction Program (T.I.P.) for the public school teachers.

In April 2009, Asst. Prof. Leonila Wilhelmina N. Baltazar of the Department of Biological and General Sciences landed 8th place in the LET Secondary Level. Two other Thomasian BSEd graduates were also among the Top 10. In the November 2010 board exam for librarians, Kristi Ma Fevie Villapando Macasaet garnered the 9th Place with the score 85.10%.

In the September 2011 Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET), the College was the number one school for the Elementary Level with the highest passing rate of 97.59% (81 out of 83 Thomasians passed). On the other hand, it was the fourth top performing school in the Secondary Level with a passing rate of 88.26% (218 out of 247 examinees passed). The national passing rate for LET Elementary Level was 22.68% and 31.45% for LET Secondary Level. Asst. Prof. Erlyn M. Geronimo, a faculty member of the College and a supervising teacher of the Education High School, landed 1st Place in the exam with a percentage score of 87.80%.

In November 2011, the Bachelor of Elementary Education and Bachelor of Secondary Education programs of the College achieved Level III PACUCOA (Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation) accreditation.

In July 2012 board exam for nutritionists and dietitians, U.S.T. was declared as the second top-performing school with 93 out of 99 examinees who passed (93.94% passing rate). Three Thomasians made it to the Top 10 Examinees' list namely: Hannah Paulyn Yu Co (1st Place - 87.00%), Patricia Alyanna Gerona Cardoza (3rd Place - 85.05%),and Kevin Estrera Carpio (4th Place - 84.95%).

In September 2012, U.S.T. was recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission as a top performing school in the elementary and secondary education levels. In the Elementary Level, U.S.T. was the SECOND TOP PERFORMING SCHOOL with 136 out of 138 examinees who passed the exam (98.55% overall passing rate). Likewise, U.S.T. was the NUMBER ONE SCHOOL on the list of THE TOP PERFORMING SCHOOLS in the Secondary Level with 160 out of 166 new Thomasian high school teachers (96.39% overall passing rate).

In November 2012, U.S.T. was one of the 3 top performing schools in the November 2012 Librarian Board Exam with 31 out of 38 Thomasians who passed the test (81.58% passing rate).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3092">A '''windpost''' is a [[Structural engineering|structural]] item used in the design and [[construction]] of [[masonry]] walls to increase lateral wall stability and protect them against damage from horizontal forces imposed by wind pressure, crowd or handrail loads.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Susan. ''Architect's working details''. vol. 10. London: Emap construct, 2004. 42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They are normally constructed from mild [[Structural steel|steel channel]] sections, supported at the head and the foot between floor slab levels and/or the principal steelwork sections forming the [[steel frame|structural frame]] of the building. In cavity walls, the windpost will typically be fixed into the inner and outer leafs of the wall by specialist fixings and fastenings at regular intervals along its length. The windposts will be spaced along the walls of the building at regular intervals as calculated by the engineer to suit the required loadings. 

In most cases a windpost is a large and very unwieldy element that can often weigh in excess of 400kg. The manufacture and delivery of both steel and concrete windposts has a significant carbon footprint and once delivered to site, their storage requires large areas to be set aside. The procurement of windposts, including the design process, often requires a lead time of four to five weeks. The length and weight of windposts makes them particularly difficult to manoeuvre into position in confined spaces. When installed as part of an internal wall, significant health and safety risks exist for the installers in lifting the windpost to its vertical position. There is no recognised mechanical lifting method to safely erect windposts.

The properties of steel windposts have inherent fire integrity, acoustic, air tightness and thermal movement issues, all of which require additional measures to achieve specification compliance at extra cost.

As an alternative to steel windposts, when the primary structure is composed of reinforced concrete, secondary structures are cast in situ to provide lateral support to masonry panels.

Recently, a new innovative technique of reinforcing blockwork walls has been developed and used in many Crossrail projects in the UK.  It consists in using uniquely designed hollow blocks to allow the construction of reinforced concrete beams and columns within the blockwork construction, which eliminate the need for traditional windposts or lintels. 
This new technique maximises masonry wall strength without thickening the wall or harming its appearance and allows the architects to design and create uninterrupted blockwork panels with flexible detailing options, whilst retaining the performance characteristics of traditional masonry such as fire integrity, acoustic performance and [[air permeability]]. This modular approach also provides the adaptability for contractors to make late changes to construction without affecting the build programme and creates seamless walls which do not require any fire protection.

Since the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|founding of the State of Israel]], relatively few women have served in the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli government]], and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman—[[Golda Meir]]—has served as [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.

{{As of|2018}}, women comprise 28% of Israel's 120-member [[Knesset]]. For comparison (as of 2004), the female ratio in the Arab world is 6.4%, in [[European Union]] average is 17.6% and in [[Scandinavia]] 40% "and rising".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/women2004.html Women In Israel] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States of America, women comprise only 19.3% of the House of Representatives. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from Arab or religious Jewish parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Women_in_public_life.html Women in Public Life] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/MKIndex_Current_eng.asp?view=3 Current Female Knesset Members] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Golda Meir]] is the only woman to serve as the [[Prime Minister of Israel]]. She was chosen for the job just before the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]] following the death of [[Levi Eshkol]], and ended her job in 1974. She and [[Tzipi Livni]] are the only women who served as [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Affairs Ministers]], Meir having served in the job for 10 years—from 1956 to 1966. Livni is the only woman to serve in the second most important job in the Israeli government, [[Deputy leaders of Israel#Vice Prime Minister|Vice Prime Minister]].

Once Golda Meir resigned in 1974, it was another 12 years until another woman was appointed as a minister with a portfolio, when [[Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino]] was appointed [[Health Minister of Israel|Health Minister]], and 18 years until a woman was appointed to any other portfolio, [[Education Minister of Israel|Education Minister]].

After Golda Meir, the leading jobs which women held are as follows: [[Education Minister of Israel|Education Minister]] for a total of 9 years (5 of them by [[Limor Livnat]], 3 years by [[Yuli Tamir]] and 1 year by [[Shulamit Aloni]]), and [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Communications]], also for a total of 7 years (6 years by [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Limor Livnat]], and 1 year by [[Dalia Itzik]]). [[Tzipi Livni]] was acting [[Justice Minister of Israel|Minister of Justice]] for a month, and then Minister of Justice for almost a year and a half. [[Ayelet Shaked]] was appointed as Minister of Justice in 2015.

Although a few women did succeed in reaching the leading posts in the Israeli government, a number of them hadn't ever been held by women, such as [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]], [[Internal Security Minister of Israel|Internal Security Minister]], [[Finance Ministry (Israel)|Finance Minister]].

== Historical overview ==
===Until the 1970s===
[[Image:Golda Meir2.jpg|thumb|[[Golda Meir]], at a meeting in the [[White House]], 1973]]
From the first Israeli government until the 12th, [[Golda Meir]] was the only woman in the Israeli government (though not the parliament). Golda Meir, who started out as a secretary of the Women's Labour Council of Histadrut, and later became the head of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]'s political department, and then an ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], came back to Israel in 1949 after she was elected to the [[Knesset]], and served as the Israeli Minister of Labor. She held this job for 7 years under a number of Prime Ministers, until in 1956 she became Foreign Minister, a job she held for 10 years until 1966.

After 3 years, in which she wasn't a member of the Israeli government, she was chosen as the head the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment party]] and as Prime Minister, and she was voted as Prime Minister again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]], when the party got the highest number of seats in the Knesset. Despite being a woman, she wasn't known as a [[Feminism|Feminist]], and she didn't appoint any other women to positions in the government.

During Golda Meir's time, the number of woman members of Knesset was around 10–14 on average (out of 120), mostly from [[Mapai]] and its successor parties. In the elections during which Golda Meir was to become prime minister, only 8 women got into the Knesset.

=== The 1970s ===

After the [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|1973 elections]], Golda Meir resigned from her position as prime minister as the result of protests after the [[Yom Kippur War]], and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was chosen to succeed her. In 1974, he appointed [[Shulamit Aloni]] as a [[minister without portfolio]]. She held this position for 5 months, until she resigned in protest over the appointment of [[Yitzhak Rafael]] as the [[Religious Services Minister of Israel|Religious Services Minister]], despite the fact that he was suspected of having accepted bribes.

=== After the 1970s ===
In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called "B’Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-election-2015/.premium-1.637916|title=Israel's first ever ultra-Orthodox women’s party makes bold debut|date=20 January 2015|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
