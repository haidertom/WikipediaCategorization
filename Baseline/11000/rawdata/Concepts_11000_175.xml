{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}

An '''alter ego''' ([[Latin]] for "other self") is a second [[Self (psychology)|self]], which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or true original [[Personality psychology|personality]]. A person who has an alter ego is said to lead a double life. The term appeared in common usage in the early 19th century when [[dissociative identity disorder]] was first described by psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Psychology |author= Irving B. Weiner, Donald K.  Freedheim|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons| page=262|isbn=0-471-17669-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNWkkLLCDKsC&amp;pg=PA262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] coined the term as part of his philosophical construct in 1st-century [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], but he described it as "a second self, a trusted friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A distinct meaning of ''alter ego'' is found in [[Literary criticism|literary analysis]] used when referring to fictional literature and other narrative forms, describing a key [[Character (arts)|character]] in a story who is perceived to be intentionally representative of the work's author (or creator), by virtue of oblique similarities, in terms of [[psychology]], behavior, speech, or thoughts, often used to convey the author's own thoughts.  The term is also sometimes, but less frequently, used to designate a hypothetical "twin" or "best friend" to a character in a story.  Similarly, the term ''alter ego'' may be applied to the role or persona taken on by an actor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology and Performing Arts | author=Glenn Daniel Wilson |year=1991|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=90-265-1119-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3shEzj0wccgC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=%22Alter+ego%22+psychology&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=PdbFRvHJM5SS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=n5bCN6TPZ1JNQGLzFv6EbVFt97g}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by other types of performers.

The existence of "another self" was first recognized in the 1730s. [[Anton Mesmer]] used [[hypnosis]] to separate the alter ego. These experiments showed a behavior pattern that was distinct from the personality of the individual when he was in the [[waking state]] compared with when he was under hypnosis. Another character had developed in the altered state of [[consciousness]] but in the same body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedersen|first=David|title=Cameral Analysis: A Method of Treating the Psychoneuroses Using Hypnosis|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London, U.K.|isbn=0-415-10424-6|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8GkPGW8KyYC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=psychological+phenomenon+of+the+Alter+ego&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aKpWumP3fC&amp;sig=5WmIGuak_oc1jIHImJh_nn2-xNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9emWT93kCsGo2wWI5IXlDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=psychological%20phenomenon%20of%20the%20Alter%20ego&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alter ego'' is also used to refer to the different behaviors any person may display in certain situations. Related concepts include [[avatar]], [[doppelgänger]], [[impersonator]], and [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID).

==In fiction==
&lt;!--[[File:Superman 296.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Superman and his ''alter ego'', Clark Kent]]--&gt;[[File:Jekyll-mansfield.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]
*The title characters in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s thriller ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' represent an exploration of the concept that good and evil exist within one person, constantly at war.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Hyde literally represents the doctor's other self, a [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who is unrestrained by the conventions of civilized society, and who shares a body with the doctor. The names "Jekyll and Hyde" have since become synonymous with a split personality or an ''alter ego'' that becomes capable of overpowering the original self.
*[[Norman Douglas]] in the late 1890s wrote a short story, "The Familiar Spirit", about a man who became aware while drowning of a conformist [[True self and false self|second self]] – "the presence within him of this Spirit, his ''alter ego'', which is bent on crushing his ambition".&lt;ref&gt;N. Douglas, ''Looking Back'' (London 1934) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[comic books]], superheroes and their [[secret identity|secret identities]] are often considered ''alter egos''. The [[archetype|archetypal]] comic book hero, [[Superman]], assumes the identity of the "mild-mannered" newspaper reporter [[Clark Kent]]  in order to live among the citizens of Metropolis without arousing suspicion. ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' comic book series further complicates this theme, as [[Bruce Banner]] loses control to the Hyde-like Hulk whenever he becomes angry, yet also depends upon the Hulk's super powers in order to combat villains. Comic book-inspired ''alter egos'' can be seen in other forms of popular fiction, including television and movie adaptations of comic books, parodies of this genre, and unrelated fictions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A listing vessel is stable and at equilibrium, but the distribution of weight aboard (often caused by uneven loading or flooding) causes it to heel to one side.

By contrast, roll is the dynamic movement from side to side caused by waves.

If a listing ship goes beyond the point where a righting moment will keep it afloat, it will [[capsize]] and potentially sink.

[[Image:Manifest I of De Stijl.JPG|thumb|300 px|[[De Stijl]] manifesto, 1918]]
An '''art manifesto''' is a public declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of an artist or artistic movement. [[Manifesto]]s are a standard feature of the various movements in the [[modernist]] avant-garde and are still written today. Art manifestos are sometimes in their rhetoric intended for shock value, to achieve a revolutionary effect. They often address wider issues, such as the political system. Typical themes are the need for revolution, freedom (of expression) and the implied or overtly stated superiority of the writers over the status quo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The manifesto gives a means of expressing, publicising and recording ideas for the artist or art group—even if only one or two people write the words, it is mostly still attributed to the group name.

In 1855 [[Gustave Courbet]] wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition. And in 1886 the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] was published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' by the poet and essayist [[Jean Moréas]].

The first art manifesto of the 20th century was introduced with the [[futurism (art)|Futurists]] in Italy in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7894877.stm |title=Back to the Futurists |first=Lawrence |last=Pollard |newspaper=News.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], [[Vorticism|Vorticists]], [[Dada]]ists and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]: the period up to World War II created what are still the best known manifestos. Although they never stopped being issued, other media such as the growth of broadcasting tended to sideline such declarations. Due to the internet there has been a resurgence of the form, and many new manifestos are now appearing to a potential worldwide audience. The [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] have made particular use of this to start a worldwide movement of affiliated groups.

Manifestos typically consist of a number of statements, which are numbered or in bullet points and which do not necessarily follow logically from one to the next. [[Tristan Tzara]]'s explanation of the manifesto (''Feeble Love &amp; Bitter Love, II'') captures the spirit of many:
{{cquote|A manifesto is a communication made to the whole world, whose only pretension is to the discovery of an instant cure for political, astronomical, artistic, parliamentary, agronomical and literary syphilis. It may be pleasant, and good-natured, it's always right, it's strong, vigorous and logical. Apropos of logic, I consider myself very likeable.}}

==Concept==
Before the early 20th century, the manifesto was almost exclusively a declaration with political aims. The intention of artists adopting the form, therefore, is to indicate that they are employing art as a political tool.

The art manifesto has two main goals. The first is to define and criticize a paradigm in contemporary art or culture; the second is to define a set of aesthetic values to counter this paradigm. Often, manifestos aspire to be works of art in their own right; for instance, many manifesto writers intend for their texts to be performed. Other manifestos cannot be fully appreciated simply as written statements because they rely heavily on graphic design for communication, a common feature in Dada manifestos. Several artists have written manifestos about artistic mediums not their own.

Historically, there has been a strong parallel between the art manifesto and the political manifesto. It was not uncommon for manifesto writers of the early 20th century to also be politically active. In Italy, Futurist founder Filippo Tomasso Marinetti ran for office, and both Russian and Italian Futurists issued political manifestos. In England, Vorticist Wyndham Lewis supported the Suffragettes, while in France, Surrealist André Breton supported the Communist party. Often however, these political organizations rejected the artists’ attention; in other cases, artists were censored and persecuted by European authoritarian governments, like Fascist Italy and Communist Russia, which institutionally rejected the avant-garde.

==Pre-1900==

===Realist Manifesto 1855===
[[Gustave Courbet]] wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition, 1855, echoing the tone of the period's political manifestos. In it he asserts his goal as an artist "to translate the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my epoch according to my own estimation."&lt;ref name="Realist Manifesto"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm The Metropolitan Museum of Art, ''Nineteenth–Century French Realism'', Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027081619/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |date=October 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/courbet-speaks.html Musée d'Orsay, Courbet speaks, ''Exhibition and sale of forty paintings and four drawings by Gustave Courbet, Paris 1855''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801012842/http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/courbet-speaks.html |date=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist Manifesto 1886===
In 1886 the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] was published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' by the poet and essayist [[Jean Moréas]]. It defined and characterized [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as a style whose "goal was not the ideal, but whose sole purpose was to express itself for the sake of being expressed." It names [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and [[Paul Verlaine]] as the three leading poets of the movement.&lt;ref name="Symbolist Manifesto"&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''.

==Seminal 1909–45==

===Futurist Manifesto 1909, 1914===
{{main article|Futurist Manifesto}}
The Futurist Manifesto, written by the [[Italy|Italian]] poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], was published in the Italian newspaper ''Gazzetta dell'Emilia'' in [[Bologna]] on February 5, 1909, then in French as ''Manifeste du futurisme'' in the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on February 20, 1909. It initiated an artistic [[philosophy]], [[Futurism]], that was a rejection of the past, and a celebration of speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry; it  was also an advocation of the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of [[Italy]].

Since the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, the Futurists attempted to create one in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft|title=I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti [et al.]|first=Filippo Tommaso|last=Marinetti|publisher=[Firenze Lacerba]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting and sculpture. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubist Manifesto 1912===
{{main article|Du "Cubisme"}}
[[File:Du "Cubisme", 1912, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Eugène Figuière Editeurs (cover).jpg|thumb|Du "Cubisme", 1912, [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]], published by [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière Éditeurs]] (cover)]]
Du "Cubisme", written in 1912 by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]], was the first major theoretical text on [[Cubism]]. The book was illustrated with works by Gleizes, Metzinger, [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]. In this highly influential treatise Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]] sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] were used to convey a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] sense of fluidity of consciousness.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent |date=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Du "Cubisme"]] introduced the concept of 'simultaneity' into the theoretical framework of Cubism. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on the authors understanding of [[Henri Poincaré]] and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. It was based both on philosophical and scientific ideas, on [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in the widely available publication, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Concrete Manifesto 1959===
Neo-Concrete Manifesto, by [[Ferreira Gullar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/st_writ.asp?ID=10&amp;Type=2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420213302/http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/st_writ.asp?ID=10&amp;Type=2 |date=April 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; begins:
:We use the term "neo-concrete" to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative "geometric" art (neo-plasticism, constructivism, suprematism, the school of Ulm) and particularly the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously acute rationalism. In the light of their artistic experience, the painters, sculptors, engravers and writers participating in this first Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to evaluate the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains."

===Manifesto of Industrial Painting 1959===
"Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art", written by [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html |title=Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio |publisher=Notbored.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1959, was originally published in Italian in ''Notizie Arti Figurative'' No. 9 (1959). Shortly afterwards it was published in ''Internationale Situationniste no.3'' in a French translation. It was translated into English in 1997 by Molly Klein. It has only 70 points and is written a grand utopian rhetorical manner, with statements such as, "A new, ravenous force of domination will push men toward an unimaginable epic poetry." One of its themes is the reconciliation of industry and nature:
:The return to nature with modern instrumentation will allow man, after thousands of centuries, to return to the places where Paleolithic hunters overcame great fear; modern man will seek to abandon his own, accumulated in the idiocy of progress, on contact with humble things, which nature in her wisdom has conserved as a check on the immense arrogance of the human mind.

==Counterculture 1960–75==
Manifestos in the 1960s reflected the changing social and political attitudes of the times: the general ferment of "[[counterculture]]" revolution to overthrow the existing order and the particular rise of [[feminism]] and [[Black Power]], as well as the pioneering of new art forms such as [[body art]] and [[performance art]].

===Situationist Manifesto 1960===
The [[Situationist International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/manifesto.html |title=Situationist International Online |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |date=May 17, 1960 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded at Cosio d’Arroscia April 27, 1957 by eight members, who wanted a revolutionary art with a state of constant transformation, and hence newness, as well as abolishing the gap between art and life. The manifesto espousing this was issued May 17, 1960 and reprinted in ''Internationale Situationniste'' number 4 in June 1960. It advocated the "new human force" against technology and the "dissatisfaction of its possible uses in our senseless social life", stating "We will inaugurate what will historically be the last of the crafts. The role of amateur-professional situationist—of anti-specialist—is again a specialization up to the point of economic and mental abundance, when everyone becomes an 'artist'". Its final sentence is: "Such are our goals, and these will be the future goals of humanity."

It begins with the prompts for the later statements in the manifesto, the first line being, "Due to the fact that I have painted monochromes for fifteen years". It is a meditation by the artist about his work and life:
:An artist always feels uneasy when called upon to speak of his own work. It should speak for itself, particularly when it is valid.
:What can I do? Stop now?
:No, what I call "the indefinable pictorial sensibility" absolutely escapes this very personal solution.
:So...
He [[Appropriation (art)|appropriates]] the sky:
:Once, in 1946, while still an adolescent, I was to sign my name on the other side of the sky during a fantastic "realistico-imaginary" journey. That day, as I lay stretched upon the beach of Nice, I began to feel hatred for birds which flew back and forth across my blue, cloudless sky, because they tried to bore holes in my greatest and most beautiful work.
:Birds must be eliminated.
He ends with an affirmation that he is "ready to dive into the void".

===I Am For An Art... Manifesto, 1961===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], a Pop artist, reacting against [[Abstract Expressionism]], along with other young artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oldenburg|first=Claes|title=Claes Oldenburg: I am for an Art|url=http://artiststatements.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/claes-oldenburg-i-am-for-an-art/|work=Artist Statements|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto ‘I am for an Art’ was originally made to be included in the catalogue of the 'Environments, Situations and Spaces’ exhibition. Each of the statements begin with 'I am for an art...'.

The following quote is from the first two statement in his poetical manifesto:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum.&lt;br /&gt;I am for an art that grows up not knowing it is art at all, an art given the chance of having a starting

It is written in lower case, with upper case for certain key phrases, some underlined. Its first paragraph is:
:Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, — purge the world of "Europanism"!
It advocates revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals."

===[[SCUM Manifesto]] 1967===
SCUM, by [[Valerie Solanas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solanas|first=Valerie|title=The SCUM Manifesto|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/rants/scum.html|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an acronym for the "Society for Cutting up Men" and the manifesto was not specifically about art. However, it has become part of art history, because it was published in 1968, the same year that Solanas, who had spent time in [[Andy Warhol]]'s "Factory", shot and nearly killed him. It also has sections that address art ideas. Solanas spent her last years as a street prostitute and died in 1988.

It is a document of just over 11,000 words. Its tone and basic theme are evident from the title, but it is not quite as clear cut as it seems and some women are admitted to be as bad as men (women artists, for example). SCUM wants to "destroy all useless and harmful objects — cars, store windows, "Great Art", etc." In a section on "'Great Art' and 'Culture'" it states:
:The male 'artist' attempts to solve his dilemma of not being able to live, of not being female, by constructing a highly artificial world in which the male is heroized, that is, displays female traits, and the female is reduced to highly limited, insipid subordinate roles, that is, to being male.
:The male 'artistic' aim being, not to communicate (having nothing inside him he has nothing to say), but to disguise his animalism, he resorts to symbolism and obscurity ('deep' stuff). The vast majority of people, particularly the 'educated' ones, lacking faith in their own judgment, humble, respectful of authority ('Daddy knows best'), are easily conned into believing that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, ambiguity and boredom are marks of depth and brilliance ...
:Absorbing 'culture' is a desperate, frantic attempt to groove in an ungroovy world, to escape the horror of a sterile, mindless, existence. `Culture' provides a sop to the egos of the incompetent, a means of rationalizing passive spectating; they can pride themselves on their ability to appreciate the `finer' things, to see a jewel where this is only a turd (they want to be admired for admiring).

===Maintenance Art Manifesto 1969===
The full title of the manifesto is "Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition"; it is considered a seminal document of feminist art. [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]] was pregnant at the time, and decided to reinterpret household chores by becoming a "maintenance artist", where she would "perform" them. Through this such "maintenance" revealed itself as an important condition for freedom and social functioning and she extended the idea beyond feminism to projects like the 11 month ''Touch Sanitation'', involving 8,500 New York workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/touch_sanitatio.php |title=Touch Sanitation |first=Robert C. |last=Morgan |publisher=Communityarts.net |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308031259/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/touch_sanitatio.php |archivedate=March 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently she has addressed a landfill site on [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jewishculture.org/visual_arts_articles/publications_jcn_sp02_landfill.html |title=Learning from Landfill |first=Daniel |last=Belasco |work=Jewish Culture News |date=Spring 2001 |accessdate=April 7, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220154152/http://www.jewishculture.org/visual_arts_articles/publications_jcn_sp02_landfill.html |archivedate=February 20, 2003 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto was followed by a questionnaire (1973–76) and was concerned with making art of what would normally be seen as routine, mundane chores. She wrote, "After the revolution, who is going to pick up the garbage on Monday morning?". She followed this up with a "Sanitation Manifesto!" (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.schroederromero.com/press/nyt1002.html |title=Power and Glory in Sisterhood |first=Edward M. |last=Gomez |work=New York Times |date=October 13, 2002 |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |publisher=schroederromero.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maintenance Manifesto stated:

:Maintenance is a drag; it takes all the fucking time (lit.) The mind boggles and chafes at the boredom. The culture confers lousy status on maintenance jobs--minimum wages, housewives — no pay. Clean your desk, wash the dishes, clean the floor, wash your clothes, wash your toes, change the baby's diaper, finish the report, correct the typos, mend the fence, keep the customer happy, throw out the stinking garbage, watch out don't put things in your nose, what shall I wear, I have no sox, pay your bills, don't litter, save string, wash your hair, change the sheets, go to the store, I'm out of perfume, say it again — he doesn't understand, seal it again — it leaks, go to work, this art is dusty, clear the table, call him again, flush the toilet, stay young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artgroove.com/quotes1.shtml |title=Quotes from Maintenance Art Manifesto |publisher=artgroove.com |date=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426171609/http://www.artgroove.com/quotes1.shtml |archivedate=April 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AfriCobra Manifesto 1970===
Afri-Cobra was a black artist collective founded in the late 1960s by [[Jeff Donaldson (artist)|Jeff Donaldson]] and based in Chicago. He helped organise international shows of black artists and wrote influential manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/a/african_american_7.html |title=African American Art |publisher=artlex.com |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326174351/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/a/african_american_7.html |archivedate=March 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AfriCobra is an acronym for "African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists". This was derived from combining the term for Africa with "Cobra", the "Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists". The manifesto stated the groups objectives to be the development of a new African American art, involving social responsibility, community artistic involvement and promotion of pride in Black identity. There were parallels with African American musical innovations, and the advocacy of a complementary aesthetic involving sublime imagery and high-key colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asrc.cornell.edu/blacknessincolor/galleries/galllery7left.html |title=Movements, Groups and Kindred Spirits |publisher= Asrc.cornell.edu |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAR Manifestos early 1970s===
WAR is an acronym for "Women Artists in Revolution" of which [[Nancy Spero]] was a member. Prior to this in 1966–70 she had created a series of anti-[[Vietnam War]] "manifestos" which were images created with water paints and inks on paper. She then attended AWC (Art Workers Coalition) meetings, which had men and women members, and became part of WAR, which was an offshoot. She said, "I loved it. I was so angry at that time about so many things, especially about not being able to get my art out, to get people to look. I thought, "WAR"— that's it. We started to organize some actions and protests and wrote manifestos. For example, a few of us marched into the Museum of Modern Art and demanded equality for women artists. Then, I joined another, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists. It all went very fast in those days."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/arts/nov03/spero.html The Brooklyn rail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219030742/http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/arts/nov03/spero.html |date=February 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

vengeance the future of women's art" and "made important theoretical contributions to communicating a personal feminism in performance. She felt that it was important politically to create art. 'I knew that if I did it naked, I would really change how the

The French [[Sociological art]] Collective was founded by [[Fred Forest]], [[Jean-Paul Thénot]] and [[Hervé Fischer]] and had their manifesto published in the newspaper [[Le Monde]].  Its main purpose was using sociology to underpin artistic actions, or using artistic actions to elucidate sociological phenomena.  One such action was the auctioning of a "artistic square meter" in 1976 to spoof the inflation of prices in the housing and art markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/20_en.htm#text |title=Web Net Museum-Fred forest-Retrospective-Sociologic art-Aesthetic of communication-Artworks-Actions-The artistic square meter |publisher=Webnetmuseum.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective made heavy use of mass media and live performance using video, telephones, etc.  The group was dissolved in 1981, though some of its tenets were brought by [[Fred Forest]] and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] with the [[Communication aesthetics]] movement of 1983.&lt;ref name=crono/&gt;

=== A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism  1975===
by [[Paul Hartal]]

This is a four-page document illustrated with nine black and white images of the artist's paintings, collages and multimedia, published in Montreal in 1975.
"My art is a painted metaphor; the past machine of a perpetual second, the fossil emotion of an infinite longing, the magic desire evolving on the broken axis of the compressed space, reflected in the form of inner, personal landscapes", writes Hartal in the manifesto. "Art ought to be total", he suggests. "The biotic separated from the geometrical is arbitrary, and ignores the human nature." The idea of  "Lyrical Conceptualism is based on the wholeness of the psychological coordinate", he says. It "derives from the id, ego and superego"; an "art in which the primarily twofold character of the artist's view evolves into a lyrical, intuitive and conceptual triad". In The Brush and the Compass: The Interface Dynamics of Art and Science (Lanham: University Press of America, 1988, 341 pp), Hartal discusses in more detail the theory of ''Lyrical Conceptualism'' or ''Lyco art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federationofpoets.com/featurepaulhartal.htm |title=Canadian Federation of Poets Member Feature |publisher=Federationofpoets.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthbys.com/Paul_Hartal.htm |title=Paul Hartal: Love and Cosmos, Lyrical Conceptualism, Contemporary Paintings, Works on Paper |publisher=Arthbys.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicboard.com |title=publicboard.com |publisher=publicboard.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Online |first=Saatchi |url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/yourgallery/artist_profile//11739.html |title=Sell Artwork, Buy Original Paintings, Art Prints, Discover New Artists &amp;#124; Saatchi Online |publisher=Saatchi-gallery.co.uk |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monkdogz.com/literature.htm |title=Monkdogz Urban Art/ |publisher=Monkdogz.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206002338/http://www.monkdogz.com/literature.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arteutile.net/Hartal/Hartal.htm |title=Hartal |publisher=Arteutile.net |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punk and cyber 1976–1998==
The rise of the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement with its basic and aggressive DIY attitude had a significant input into art manifestos, and this is reflected even in the titles. Some of the artists overtly identified with punk through music, publishing or poetry performance. There is also an equivalent "shocking" interpretation of feminism which contradicts the non-objectification advocated in the 1960s. Then the growing presence of the computer age began to assert itself in art proclamations as in society.

===Crude Art Manifesto 1978===
Artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] promoted the Crude Art Manifesto 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/CrudeArtManifesto.html |title=Stuckism |publisher=Stuckism |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was posted in [[Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design|Maidstone Art College]] by Charles Thomson, then a student at the college. 21 years later he co-wrote the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] manifestos with [[Billy Childish]]. Thomson was also a member of the punk-based [[The Medway Poets]]. The manifesto rejects "department store" art and "elitist" gallery art, as well as sophistication and skill which are "easily obtainable ... and are used both industrially and artistically to conceal a poverty of content." The priority is stated to be "the exploration and expression of the human spirit".

===Smile Manifestos 1982===
by [[Stewart Home]]

At this time Stewart Home operated as a one-person movement "Generation Positive", founding a punk band called White Colours and publishing an art fanzine ''Smile'', which mostly contained art manifestos for the "Generation Positive". The rhetoric of these resembled the 1920s Berlin Dadaist manifestos. His idea was that other bands round the world should also call themselves White Colours and other magazines be titled ''Smile''. The first part of the book ''Neoist Manifestos/The Art Strike Papers'' featured abriged versions of his manifesto-style writings from ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|"Stewart Home", Wikipedia]] Retrieved April 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Association of Astronomical Artists Manifesto 1982===
The basic tenet of the IAAA is the depiction of space (as in the cosmos) through realist painting. They disassociate themselves from science fiction and fantasy artists: "a firm foundation of knowledge and research is the basis for each painting. Striving to accurately depict scenes which are at present beyond the range of human eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iaaa.org/manifesto.html | title=The IAAA Manifesto | work=International Association of Astronomical Artists | accessdate=September 15, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921183906/http://iaaa.org/manifesto.html | archive-date=September 21, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group now has over 120 members representing 20 countries.

===Cheap Art Manifesto 1984===

The whole title is "the Why Cheap Art? manifesto". It is a single sheet, issued by the Bread and Puppet Theater "in direct response to the business of art and its growing appropriation by the corporate sector." There are seventeen statements, most of them beginning "Art is" and ending with an exclamation mark, set out mostly in upper case, sometimes mixed in with lower case, in different typefaces which get bolder through the leaflet till the final statement of a large HURRAH. It starts:
:People have been thinking too long that art is a privilege of the museums &amp; the rich.
:Art is not business!
It stresses the positive nature of art which is beneficial to all and should be available to all, using poetic images such as "Art is like green trees", and urging, "Art fights against war &amp; stupidity! ... Art is cheap!

This has the full title of "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth-Century." Donna Haraway is a cultural historian. She advocates the development of cyborgs ("cybernetic organisms") as the way forward for a post-gender society. This had a significant effect initially amongst academics. VNS Matrix, a group of Australian women artists and British cultural historian, [[Sadie Plant]], established a cyberfeminist movement in 1994. From 1997, the Old Boys Network (OBN) has organised "Cyberfeminist Internationals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/overview_of_media_art/society/scroll/ |title=Social Technologies: Deconstruction, subversion and the utopia of democratic communication |first= Inke |last=Arns |date=April 7, 2006 |publisher=Medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto is five paragraphs, each with a subtitle, the first of which is "Art for All", summing up the popularist intent of their manifesto:
:We want Our Art to speak across the barriers of knowledge directly to People about their Life and not about their knowledge of art. The twentieth century has been cursed with an art that cannot be understood. The decadent artists stand for themselves and their chosen few, laughing at and dismissing the normal outsider. We say that puzzling, obscure and form-obsessed art is decadent and a cruel denial of the Life of People.
There is also an intent to change people, but "The art-material must be subservient to the meaning and purpose of the picture." It states:
:We want to learn to respect and honour "the whole". The content of mankind is our subject and our inspiration. We stand each day for good traditions and necessary changes. We want to find and accept all the good and bad in ourselves.
The conclusion is an affirmation of "our life-search for new meanings and purpose to give to life."

The manifesto was signed by [[Veronica Vera]] and [[Candida Royalle]] (both ex porn stars who had then directed their own porn movies), [[Annie Sprinkle]] (who gives explicit sexual one woman shows) and performance artist [[Frank Moore (performance artist)|Frank Moore]], among other significant artists  who use sex in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikonenmagazin.de/interview/Ovidie.htm |title=Beyond the Porno Manifesto |first=Martin |last=Kreischer |date=January 2005 |accessdate=April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 7 short points, it founds an art movement, which "celebrates sex as the nourishing, life-giving force. We embrace our genitals as part, not separate, from our spirits." It  advocates the "attitude of sex-positivism" and wishes to "communicate our ideas and emotions ... to have fun, heal the world and endure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drsusanblock.com/editorial/moore/postporn.htm |title=Post Porn, Post Sex, A New Art Movement |first=Frank |last=Moore |date=1989–1993 |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VNS Matrix was a cyberfeminist art collective founded in Adelaide, Australia, in 1991. Their manifesto, written in 1991, was translated over the years into many languages including Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Finnish. It begins:
:we are the modern cunt
:positive anti reason
:unbounded unleashed unforgiving
:we see art with our cunt we make art with our cunt
In 1996 they wrote the Bitch Mutant Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/meme/symp/contrib/vns.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303104255/http://www.aec.at/meme/symp/contrib/vns.html |date=March 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ____________ Manifesto proposed an interactive, fill-in-the-blanks view of prohibitions and claims to be made about art and art movements. It was an early interactive piece of net art that appeared in webzines and in newsgroups, inviting participation. It begins:
:Today, ____________ itself is obsolete.
The manifesto ends with a ''Reset'' button. The text is sampled from Tristian Tzara's Dada manifestos, but key pieces from the original text have been omitted and replaced with blanks to be filled-in.

It is one of the earliest manifestos to be published on the Internet as well as in print.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Taylor. ''The Literature of Society Series: The Manifesto in Literature, vol. 3,'' St James Press, New York, 2013, pp. 84-87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group Hangman 1997===

Group Hangman was started by [[Billy Childish]], [[Tracey Emin]] and two others in [[Medway]], [[Kent]] in 1983 for a short time. Fourteen years later it reformed with more members (nearly all of whom later joined the Stuckists art group), but without Emin. At this point Childish wrote 6 short manifestos, each containing 7 – 12 statements. He says, "they were anarchic and contradictory - my favourite!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trakmarx.com/2004_02/10_billy.htm |title=Billy Childish interview |publisher= Trakmarx.com |accessdate= April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas resurfaced in the Stuckist manifestos written two years later. Point 9 of ''Communication 0001'' states:
:Western art has been stupefying its audience into taking the position of an admiring doormat. We, at Group Hangman however, intend to wipe our mud-encrusted boots on the face of conceptual balderdash.
Style must be smashed ("Artistic talent is the only obstacle") and the unacceptable must be embraced. The last communication, of only two short sentences, was written in 2000 and recommends, "It is time for art to grow up."

=== Extropic Art Manifesto 1997 ===

(A genre of the [[Transhumanist art]] movement whose manifesto was written in 1982)

This was written on January 1, 1997, and was apparently "on board the [[Cassini Huygens]] spacecraft on its mission to Saturn." Following the statement "We are transhumans", there is the explanation, "Transhumanist Art reflects an extropic appreciation of aesthetics in a technologically enhanced world." After the manifesto is a "FAQ", which states, "Transhumanist Arts include creative works by scientists, engineers, technicians, philosophers, athletes, educators, mathematicians, etc., who may not be artists in the traditional sense, but whose vision and creativity are integral to transhumanity." The Manifesto is based on a ''Transhumanist Art Statement'' written in 1982. Cited as specific influences are "Abstract Art, Performance Art, Kinetic Art, Cubism, Techno Art, science fiction and Communications Art." Some collaborators of Vita-More's are named as [[Timothy Leary]], [[Bill Viola]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

==World wide web 1999–present==
Widespread access to the internet has created a new incentive for artists to publish manifestos, with the knowledge that there is an instant potential worldwide audience. The effect of the internet on art manifestos has been described: "One could almost say we are living through a new boom time for the manifesto. The Web allows almost anybody to nail a broadsheet to the virtual wall for all to see."&lt;ref name=manifestodestiny&gt;{{cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Simon  |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0120,reynolds,24748,10.html |title=Manifesto destiny |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date= May 15–22, 2001 |accessdate= August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the manifestos also appear in print form; others only exist as virtual text. It has also led to a great diversity of approaches, as well as a noticeable trend looking back at earlier traditions of Modernism or the Renaissance to create a present and future paradigm. The Stuckists manifesto has become well known, though most others have achieved little individual reputation or impact.

The 4th point states, "Artists who don't paint aren't artists"; the 5th is, "Art that has to be in a gallery to be art isn’t art." Points are made against [[conceptual art]], [[Young British Artists|Britart]], [[Charles Saatchi]], art gimmicks and white wall galleries, while the amateur is hailed. The final point is:
:Stuckism embraces all that it denounces. We only denounce that which stops at the starting point — Stuckism starts at the stopping point!
This manifesto is available on their web site in 7 languages. They have issued at least 8 other manifestos, including the [[Remodernism|Remodernist]] Manifesto (2000), which inaugurates "a new spirituality in art" (to replace [[Postmodernism]]'s "scientific materialism, nihilism and spiritual bankruptcy"), the [[Turner Prize]] Manifesto, handed out in their [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstrations]] at [[Tate Britain]] and a Critique of Damien Hirst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503150414/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html |date=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate]] gallery holds three of the manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.tate.org.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=tb-calm&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='stuckists') |work=Tate archive catalogue |title=Stuckists |publisher= Archive.tate.org.uk |accessdate=July 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin-offs by other Stuckists include a [[Camberwell College of Arts]] Students for Stuckism manifesto (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuckism.com/manifest_Student.html |title=Sensational? |publisher=Stuckism |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a teenagers' Underage Stuckists Manifesto (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html |title=Stuckism |publisher=Stuckism |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Allen Herndon]] published ''The Manifesto of the American Stuckists'', whose content was challenged by the Los Angeles Stuckists group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=La-stuckism.com |url=http://www.la-stuckism.com/blog/2006/12/against-national-chauvinism-in-art.html |title=Against national chauvinism in art |location= Stuck in L.A. |date=December 17, 2006 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an anti-Stuckist manifesto published in 2005 by the London Surrealist Group.

===Versatilist Manifesto 2007===

S.|year=2011|title=Reflections on the versatilist manifesto|publisher=[[University of São Paulo|USP]]|accessdate=August 25, 2012|language=pt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Versatilist Manifesto]] was written by [[Brazil]]ian composer, artist and writer, [[Denis Mandarino]], with the intention of freeing people from the expert analysis and promote the practice of art as a form of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and spiritual enhancement, in [[São Paulo]] in July 2007. In Versatilism, there are no art contests, as no man or group is capable of judging other men. An art critic always analyses a situation from a profoundly limited point of view because his knowledge is also limited. Contests and prizes can be a way of directing public opinion and on doing so, valorizing this or that artist that aims financial or social advantages. Nevertheless, [[cultural|ethical cultural]] initiatives are praiseworthy.

===The Remodernist Film Manifesto 2008===

A manifesto on filmmaking written by former [[Stuckist]] painter, photographer and filmmaker Jesse Richards that like the closely related [[Remodernism]] manifesto, calls for a "new spirituality", but in this instance, in relation to cinema. The manifesto proclaims a spiritual film to be "not about religion. It is cinema concerned with humanity and an understanding of the simple truths and moments of humanity. Spiritual film is really ALL about these moments". Point 4 of the manifesto discusses [[Japan]]ese aesthetics in relation to the idea of [[Remodernist film]]: "The Japanese ideas of [[wabi-sabi]] (the beauty of imperfection) and [[mono no aware]] (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film". The manifesto also criticizes filmmakers that shoot on video, arguing that film, particularly Super-8 film "has a rawness, and an ability to capture the poetic essence of life, that video has never been able to accomplish" and also criticizes [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s work, as being "dishonest and boring", as well as [[Dogme 95]]'s "pretentious checkist" of rules. Instead, the Remodernist film philosophy seems to be somewhat anti-ego, with Richards noting that "this manifesto should be viewed only as a collection of ideas and hints whose author may be mocked and insulted at will". The manifesto was recently translated into Turkish and published by the film website Bakiniz, and is being translated into Polish and published by the Polish underground art and culture magazine, RED.

The manifesto is quite specific in what the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement want to achieve. [[Superstroke]] is short for the super expressive brush stroke.
The Manifesto for the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement written by Conrad Bo is as follows: 1.Paintings should be executed using expressive even violent brush strokes on at least some part of the picture. 2.Should a photograph be used for a figurative painting, the objection should not be Photorealism, but Expressionism. 3.If mediums such as pen, pencil, etc. are used, the pen and pencil strokes must at least be overly expressive for it to be considered a Superstroke picture. 4.Paintings can be executed in both the abstract and figurative. 5.Subject matters such as Africa, light, dark, life and death are encouraged. 6.Collage, Stencil and Calligraphy may be used for impact. 7.The concept, Art for the sake of art, does not apply in Superstroke. In Superstroke it is art for the sake of Superstroke, as the artist must always strive for paintings rich in texture, or excessive brush or pencil strokes.

===Examples of manifestos on the internet===
{{original research|section|date=May 2018}}
These manifestos are cited not for their individual significance, but as examples of the diversity of approaches that can be found in manifestos on the web, ranging through computer art, "Gothic" art, jokes, traditional art, punk provocation and the use of the form by commerce. This also allows the influence of historical manifestos on contemporary ideas to be assessed.

by [[Kerry Mitchell]]

There is an introduction followed by two sections—"Fractal art is" (4 bullet points) and "Fractal art is not" (3 bullet points). Fractal art has been around "15–20 years". It is obviously concerned with computer-generated fractal images, but advanced as art "in many respects similar to photography—another art form which was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing Fractal Artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers." The need for selection and skill is stressed, as is the need for the practitioner to be "expressive" and "creative". It concludes, "Most of all, Fractal Art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART."

'''OK Art Manifesto 2001'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0105/msg00023.html |title=OK ART Manifesto |publisher=Amsterdam.nettime.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by Susie Ramsay and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer

This was written tongue-in-cheek, beginning, "'OK art' is an OK idea,—not great, but not bad either." It has the ring of truth when it states in point 4: "Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying 'that was OK'. No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either."

'''Movement for Classical Renewal Manifesto 2002'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalrenewal.org/manifesto.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021211075103/http://www.classicalrenewal.org/manifesto.htm |archivedate=December 11, 2002 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=December 11, 2002 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Christopher Fiddes

This British manifesto is signed by over 100 painters and sculptors of professional standing. It opens by stating "the visual arts have reached a point of crisis. The art that has enjoyed critical acclaim in recent decades is shallow, trivial, ill-crafted and bankrupt of ideas." It condemns [[abstract art|abstraction]], "the same tired formula" of [[conceptual art|conceptualism]], the Turner Prize and the destruction of art school academic training by the [[Coldstream Committee]] in the mid-20th century. It advocates technical accomplishment, reverence for the "great art that has been in the past" and a return to tradition while also, ironically, acknowledging:
:The arrival of the internet means it is no longer necessary to exhibit one's work in the tiny handful of fashionable London galleries, for at the touch of a switch it can be placed before a world wide public.
An organisation with similar aims in America is the Art Renewal Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artrenewal.org/ |title=artrenewal.org |publisher=artrenewal.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This represents the adoption of a revolutionary medium by mainstream commercialism, in this case the Cass Art chain of artshops in London. As part of their promotion they have issued a "manifesto" in the style of an art group. It begins, "Art is freedom. Cass Art believes in art." There are seven points. The sixth starts, "Lets fill this town with artists", which has also been displayed across their shop fronts in a banner.

'''Atmatusti''' is translated into English as being “what is pleasing to one's self” &lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. ''The Law Code of Manu''. 2.6.&lt;/ref&gt; – it is important to recognize "what is pleasing to one's self, oneself is not equal one's self", for without knowing one's self one cannot know what is pleasing to self. For instance, editing this Wikipedia line is pleasing to me, I'm self, re-editing it and leaving it to the prior state is also pleasing to me, thus only one who knows one's self must edit, all others are not following Atmatusti, thus Atmatusti is not meant for those who do not know one's self, taking oneself to be one's self is the root of all misery. Other scholars have also used different terms to describe atmatusti.  For example, Derrett’s translation from French to English of Lingat’s ‘‘The Classical Law of India’’ has coined the term “inner contentment” in reference to atmatusti. Lingat states that inner contentment can be best understood as "the approval of one's conscious".&lt;ref name="Lingat, Robert 1973. pp. 6"&gt;Lingat, Robert. 1973. Ch. 1, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only Manu and Yājñavalkya refer to atmatusti as the fourth source of [[dharma]] within the [[Hindu Law]] tradition. Scholars reject atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma because of this.  Textual accounts of Manu's and Yajnavalkya's placement of atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma can be found in The Law Code of Manu 2.6 and The Law Code of Yajnavalkya 1.7.  Also, atmatusti does not share the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara.  Atmatusti differs significantly from the other three sources of dharma in that it is not based on an "authority exterior to man"; in other words, an individual is able to create their own authority for any issue not covered under sruti, smriti, and acara.&lt;ref name="Lingat, Robert 1973. pp. 6" /&gt;  The first three sources of law are rooted in the vedas whereas atmatusti is not.  It is because of this that atmatusti, as a fourth source, is not recognized by most scholars due to the lack of legitimacy.

==Sources of Dharma==

#Veda ([[śruti]])
#Tradition ([[smṛti]])
#Good Custom ([[ācāra]])
#Inner Contentment (ātmatuṣṭi)

==Textual Accounts==

There are only two instances where Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source of dharma within the [[dharmasastras]].

The first instance comes from The Law Code of Manu or Manava Dharmasastra (MDh).  The [[Laws of Manu]] are commentaries on the dharmasastras by a sage named Manu and therefore is considered apart of [[smriti]].  Because of this, The Law Code of Manu has a great amount of authority.  However, Manu’s view of Atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma seemingly was not shared universally with other sages; except a sage named Yajnavalkya.  This is understood through the lack of other smriti texts or dharmasastra commentaries in which Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source.  Manu lists atmatusti along with sruti, smriti, and acara as being “the four visible marks of the law”.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. ''The Law Code of Manu''. 2.12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manu's use of the phrase "the four visible marks of law", however, is not explained in relation to atmatusti legitimately being a fourth source of dharma.  The significance here is therefore based interpretation.  The first textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma is as follows:

:"The root of the Law is the entire Veda; the tradition and practice of those who know the Veda; the conduct of good people; and what is pleasing to oneself." (MDh 2.6)&lt;ref name="Davis pp. 6"&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. ''The Spirit of Hindu Law''. Ch. 1, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second instance comes from The Law Code of Yajnavalkya (YDh).  Here Yajnavalkya, in addition to listing Atmatusti as a fourth source, also lists a fifth source of dharma: "the desire born of proper intention".  However, Yajnavalkya is the only person to list this fifth source; therefore, its recognition among scholars is almost non-existent.  The lack of support within the dharmasastras as a whole shows that the Hindu community, for the most part, did not find Yajnavalkya's fifth source of dharma correctly listed or legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. ''The Spirit of Hindu Law''. Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma along with the listing of a fifth source is as follows:

:"The Veda, tradition, the standards of the good, what is pleasant to one’s own self, [and] the desire born of proper intention—these are the roots of dharma." (YDh 1.7)&lt;ref name="Davis pp. 6" /&gt;

==Role of Atmatusti within Hindu Law==

The appointment of atmatusti as a fourth source can be understood by looking at the hierarchy of the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lingat, Robert. 1973. Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authority of each source is outlined along with the authoritative relationship the sources have on one another.  Sruti, the first source, is superior and has more authority than Smriti and Acara.  Smriti, the second source, in turn has authority over Acara, the third source.  This is understandable in that the vedic texts are superior to tradition.  Hence, it is only when the vedic texts do not provide the necessary dharma needed; will tradition or the secondary vedic texts be sought out.  And, only when tradition does not provide the dharma on a specific topic should customary laws be looked into.  Therefore, Manu appoints atmatusti as a last resort and fourth source of dharma for instances where the vedas, tradition, and customs all do not provide the necessary dharma or law.

Atmatusti creates a guide in which a person does not obey laws because it is what they were told to do, but because the person has reverence for the law. It can be used to do what is a right in the context of legal manners, but it is generally not viewed as a moral compass that believers should follow. However, the legal aims of atmatusti are usually consistent with the Veda, seeing as the person's inner-self is partly built on by the individual's education. Therefore, the atmatusti is closely connected with a more highly acknowledged source of [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Donald R. 2007. “On Atmatusti as a Source of Dharma.” Journal of the American Oriental Society: 294-295. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''autonomous building''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, [[gas grid]], municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and in some cases, [[public road]]s.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced [[environmental impact]]s, increased security, and lower [[costs of ownership]]. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)

Most of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.

British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] have said that, as of 2002, &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a "house with no bills" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vale |first= Brenda and Robert |authorlink= Brenda and Robert Vale |title= The New Autonomous House|year= 2000|publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|location= London |isbn=0-500-34176-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of "[[bioshelter]]" projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the "New Alchemy Institute".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html "New Alchemy Institute"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818015757/http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html |date=2006-08-18 }} (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.

[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an [[Earthship]], featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]

The 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berm]]s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].

1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.

==Advantages==

As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.

Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.

Autonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.

An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.

==Disadvantages==

First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.

Living within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.

An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.

[[Brenda and Robert Vale|The Vales]], among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice&amp;mdash;under certain conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Systems==
This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.

===Water===
[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic [[rainwater harvesting]] system]]
[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]

There are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.

[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.

The classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.

However drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.

In regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use [[rainwater harvesting]], with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/ WHO | Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.

In many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155419/http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a "roof cleaner" tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[water chlorination|chlorinated]], though [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.

In the classic Roman house ("Domus"), household water was provided from a cistern (the "impluvium"), that was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward facing roof-opening (the "compluvium"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jefferey|title=The Roman House (Domus)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/roman-domestic-architecture-domus|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vitruvius|translator-last1=Morgan|translator-first1=Morris Hickey|title=The Ten Books of Architecture|date=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=6.3|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Vitruvius__the_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.

Reducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.

It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.

[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).

New technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.

===Sewage===
{{see also|Anaerobic digestion}}
====Resource====

[[Image:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]
[[Composting toilet]]s use bacteria to decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste.  Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of "[[humanure]]" for growing food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is microbial and viral contamination.  In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months.  To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[composting toilet]] for references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free [[reclaimed water]] can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].

Electric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.

[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission.

A big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.

Another method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.

====Waste====

Sewage handling is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.

The standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.

Septic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|vacuum truck]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.

However, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.

Composting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.

Incinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.

Traditional methods of sewage handling include [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.

===Storm drains===

Drainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.

Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.

Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:

If a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.&lt;ref&gt;Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], "Natural Capitalism," ch. 5, pp83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett&lt;/ref&gt; One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.

A [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.

===Electricity===
[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof in Manchester, UK]]
[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]

{{Further|Zero emissions|Zero-energy building}}Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. [[LED light]]s, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sunfrost rates {{convert|15|cuft|L|abbr=on}}. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic brand (formerly Servel brand) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.

Using a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.

However, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, [[wind turbine|wind generator]]s can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.

The main advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.&lt;ref name="Gipe"&gt;Paul Gipe, "Wind Power for Home and Business"&lt;/ref&gt;

During times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).&lt;ref name="Gipe"/&gt;

A grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single-wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).

In areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a "[[regenerative fuel cell]]", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.

[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.

[[Microbial fuel cell]]s and [[thermoelectric generator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biolite Portable Stoves|url=https://www.bioliteenergy.com/collections/stoves|website=bioliteenergy.com|publisher=Biolite|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firebee:Charge your USB Device!|url=http://firebeecharger.com/|website=firebeecharger.com|publisher=Firebee|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.

===Heating===
[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]

Most autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].

[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.

The basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.

A recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system "[[Annualized geo solar]] heating" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;Stephens, Don. September 2005. [http://www.greenershelter.com/TokyoPaper.pdf "'Annualized Geo-Solar Heating' as a Sustainable Residential-scale Solution for Temperate Climates iwht Less than Ideal Daily Heating Season Solar Availability."] ("Requested Paper for the Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, Tokyo, Japan"). Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.

In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.

A more modest "daily solar" design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.

In all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.

[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt; in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.

Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.

An increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813123637/http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf |date=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.

Electric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.

===Water heating===

{{Further|Solar hot water}}

[[Hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water.  They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.

Current practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a [[water heater#Tankless heaters|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.

[[Solar water heater]]s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.

The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.

[[Cogeneration]] systems produce hot water from [[waste heat]].  They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.

Heat recycling, [[cogeneration]] and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.
Some authorities advocate replacing [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] with [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.

===Cooling===

Annualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.

Less dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.

Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a [[whole-house fan]] and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.

If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the "dome effect."  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 °C}} ({{nowrap|15 °F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.

Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an "[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.

Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].

A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's [[diesel exhaust]] was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.

A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50&amp;nbsp;°F (28&amp;nbsp;°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.

If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].

===Food production===

Food production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;[http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217004825/http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html |date=February 17, 2010 }}. Retrieved 2010-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

possibly requiring the use of organic farming and [[aeroponics]]. Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include [[urban agriculture|urban gardening]] (indoors and outdoors). [[Grow house|Indoor cultivation]] may be set up using [[hydroponics]], while outdoor cultivation may be done using [[permaculture]], [[forest gardening]], [[no-till farming]], and [[do nothing farming]].

[[Greenhouse]]s are also sometimes included.&lt;ref name="publications"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The PEI Ark was a greenhouse with fishponds and living quarters.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are also outfitted with irrigation systems or [[heat sink]]-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down).&lt;ref name="publications"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The PEI Ark used its fishponds as both thermal mass and water storage.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', "value, worth"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated70"&gt;Arneson, P.

Refusing to "'''bite the cartridge'''" was a turn of phrase used by the British in India of native Indian soldiers ([[sepoy]]s) who had mutinied in 1857.

It derives from the act of biting open a [[paper cartridge]] containing [[gunpowder]] and musket ball in order to load contemporary [[rifle]]s, especially the new [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] [[rifled musket]]. The phrase is thought by some to have later spawned the more familiar idiom "[[bite the bullet]]".

One of the alleged causes of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] were rumours that the grease on these cartridges designed to keep them dry was, variously, pork or beef fat (pork being abhorrent to the [[Muslim]]s, cows being sacred to the [[Hindu]]s), thus their refusal to bite them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urdu/asbab/bijnor/app05_letter1869.html 1869 letter] by Sir [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]] on the origins of the Mutiny of 1857&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''calculus of moving surfaces''' ('''CMS''') &lt;ref&gt;Grinfeld, P. (2010). "Hamiltonian Dynamic Equations for Fluid Films". Studies in Applied Mathematics. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9590.2010.00485.x}}. {{ISSN|0022-2526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the classical [[Tensor|tensor calculus]] to deforming [[manifold]]s. Central to the CMS is the Tensorial Time Derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; whose original definition &lt;ref&gt;J. Hadamard, Lecons Sur La Propagation Des Ondes et Les Equations De
l’Hydrodynamique. Paris: Hermann, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; was put forth by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. It plays the role analogous to that of the [[covariant derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla _{\alpha }&lt;/math&gt; on [[Differentiable manifold|differential manifolds]]. in that it produces a [[tensor]] when applied to a tensor.

[[File:Hadamard2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Jacques Salomon Hadamard, French Mathematician, 1865–1963 CE]]

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; is the evolution of the [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; indexed by a time-like parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The definitions of the surface [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and the [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[geometric]] foundations of the CMS. The velocity C is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of deformation of the surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the instantaneous [[Surface normal|normal]] direction. The value of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[limit of a function|limit]]

: &lt;math&gt;C=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\text{Distance}(P,P^*)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the point on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t+h}&lt;/math&gt; that lies on the straight line perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; at point P. This definition is illustrated in the first geometric figure below. The velocity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a signed quantity: it is positive when &lt;math&gt;\overline{PP^{*}}&lt;/math&gt; points in the direction of the chosen normal, and negative otherwise. The relationship between &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is analogous to the relationship between location and velocity in elementary calculus:&amp;nbsp;knowing either quantity allows one to construct the other by [[Derivative|differentiation]] or [[Initial value problem|integration]].

[[File:C3x3t.png|thumb|350px|Geometric construction of the surface velocity C]]
[[File:DFdt3x3t.png|thumb|350px|Geometric construction of the &lt;math&gt;\delta/\delta t&lt;/math&gt;-derivative of an invariant field F]]

The Tensorial Time Derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; for a scalar field F defined on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[derivative|rate of change]] in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in the instantaneously normal direction:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta F}{\delta t}=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{F(P^*)-F(P)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is also illustrated in second geometric figure.

The above definitions are ''[[geometry|geometric]]''. In analytical settings, direct application of these definitions may not be possible. The CMS gives ''analytical'' definitions of C and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of elementary operations from [[calculus]] and [[differential geometry]].

==Analytical definitions==

For [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] definitions of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt;, consider the evolution of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z^i = Z^i \left( t ,S \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z^{i}&lt;/math&gt; are general [[curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear space coordinates]] and &lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha }&lt;/math&gt; are the surface coordinates. By convention, tensor indices of function arguments are dropped. Thus the above equations contains &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;S^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.The velocity object &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}=V^i\textbf{Z}_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[partial derivative]]

: &lt;math&gt;V^i =\frac{\partial Z^i \left( t ,S \right)}{\partial t }&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; can be computed most directly by the formula

: &lt;math&gt;C=V^i N_i &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; are the covariant components of the normal vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, defining the shift tensor representation of the Surface's Tangent Space &lt;math&gt;Z^{\alpha}_{i}=\textbf{S}^\alpha\cdot\textbf{Z}_i&lt;/math&gt; and the Tangent Velocity as &lt;math&gt;V^\alpha=Z^\alpha_iV^i&lt;/math&gt; , then the definition of the &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; derivative for an [[Tensor field|invariant]] ''F'' reads

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}F=\frac{\partial F\left( t ,S \right)}{\partial t }-V^\alpha\nabla _{\alpha }F&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the covariant derivative on S.

For ''tensors'', an appropriate generalization is needed. The proper definition for a representative tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }&lt;/math&gt; reads

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }=\frac{\partial T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }}{\partial t}-V^{\eta }\nabla _{\eta }T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }+V^{m}\Gamma ^{i}_{mk}T^{k\alpha }_{j\beta }-V^{m}\Gamma ^{k}_{mj}T^{i\alpha }_{k\beta }+\dot{\Gamma}^\alpha_\eta T^{i\eta }_{j\beta }-\dot{\Gamma}^\eta_\beta T^{i\alpha }_{j\eta }&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k_{mj}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Christoffel symbols]] and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\Gamma}^\alpha_\beta=\nabla_\beta V^\alpha-C B^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the surface's appropriate temporal symbols (&lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix representation of the surface's curvature shape operator)

==Properties of the ''δ''/''δt''-derivative==

The &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt;-derivative commutes with contraction, satisfies the [[product rule]] for any collection of indices

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}(S^i_\alpha T^\beta_j
 )=T^\beta_j\dot{\nabla}S^i_\alpha + S^i_\alpha\dot{\nabla}T^\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;

and obeys a [[chain rule]] for surface [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restrictions]] of spatial tensors:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}F^j_k(Z,t) =\frac{\partial F^j_k}{\partial t}+CN^i \nabla _i F^j_k&lt;/math&gt;

Chain rule shows that the &lt;math&gt;\delta /\delta t&lt;/math&gt;-derivative of spatial "metrics"
vanishes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}\delta^i_j=0,\dot{\nabla}Z_{ij}=0,\dot{\nabla}Z^{ij}=0,\dot{\nabla}\varepsilon _{ijk}=0,\dot{\nabla}\varepsilon^{ijk}=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are covariant and contravariant [[metric tensor]]s, &lt;math&gt;\delta ^{i}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] symbol,  and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon ^{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]s. The [[Levi-Civita symbol|main article]] on Levi-Civita symbols describes them for [[Cartesian coordinate systems]]. The preceding rule is valid in general coordinates, where the definition of the Levi-Civita symbols must include the square root of the [[determinant]] of the covariant metric tensor &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Differentiation table for the δ/δt-derivative==

The &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; derivative of the key surface objects leads to highly concise and attractive formulas. When applied to the [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] surface [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;S_{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] metric tensor &lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt;, the following identities result

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\nabla}S_{\alpha \beta } &amp;=0 \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}S^{\alpha \beta } &amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; are the doubly covariant and doubly contravariant [[Sectional curvature|curvature tensors]]. These curvature tensors, as well as for the mixed curvature tensor &lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, satisfy

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\nabla}B_{\alpha \beta }&amp; = \nabla_\alpha \nabla_\beta C + CB_{\alpha \gamma }B^\gamma_\beta \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}B^\alpha_\beta&amp; = \nabla_\beta\nabla^\alpha C + CB^\alpha_\gamma B^\gamma_\beta \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}B^{\alpha \beta }&amp; = \nabla ^\alpha \nabla^\beta C + CB^{\gamma \alpha}B^\beta_\gamma
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The shift tensor &lt;math&gt;Z^i_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the normal&lt;math&gt;N^i&lt;/math&gt; satisfy

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\nabla}Z^i_\alpha &amp; = N^i\nabla _\alpha C \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}N^i &amp; = -Z^i_\alpha \nabla^\alpha C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the surface [[Levi-Civita symbol]]s &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon ^{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; satisfy

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\delta \varepsilon _{\alpha \beta }}{\delta t} &amp; = -\varepsilon _{\alpha \beta }CB^{\gamma }_{\gamma } \\[8pt]
\frac{\delta \varepsilon ^{\alpha \beta }}{\delta t} &amp; = \varepsilon ^{\alpha \beta }CB^\gamma_\gamma
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{dablink|This page discusses the object called a '''category algebra'''; for categorical generalizations of algebra theory, see [[:Category:Monoidal categories]].}}

In [[category theory]], a field of [[mathematics]], a '''category algebra''' is an [[associative algebra]], defined for any locally finite [[Category (mathematics)|category]] and [[commutative ring]] with unity.
It generalizes the notions of [[group ring|group algebra]] and [[incidence algebra]],
just as [[Category (mathematics)|category]] generalizes the notions of [[group (mathematics)|group]] and [[partially ordered set]].

==Definition==
If the given category is finite (has finitely many objects and morphisms), then the following two definitions of the category algebra agree. 

===Group algebra-style definition===
Given a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' and a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', one can construct ''RG'', known as the [[group ring|group algebra]]; it is an ''R''-module equipped with a multiplication. A group is the same as a category with a single object such that all morphisms are isomorphisms (where the elements of the group correspond to the morphisms of the category). So the following construction generalizes the definition of the group algebra from groups to arbitrary categories.

Let ''C'' be a category and ''R'' be a [[commutative ring]] with unit. Define ''RC'' (or ''R''[''C'']) to be the [[free module|free ''R''-module]] with basis consisting of the maps of ''C''. In other words, ''RC'' consists of formal [[linear combinations]] (which are finite sums) of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i f_i&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are maps of ''C'', and ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are elements of the ring ''R''. Define a multiplication operation on ''RC'' as follows, using the composition operation in the category:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum a_i f_i \sum b_j g_j = \sum a_i b_j f_i g_j&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_i g_j=0&lt;/math&gt; if their composition is not defined. This defines a binary operation on ''RC'', and moreover makes ''RC'' into an associative algebra over the ring ''R''. This algebra is called the '''category algebra''' of ''C''.

From a different perspective, elements of the free module ''RC'' could also be considered as functions from the maps of ''C'' to ''R'' which are finitely supported. Then the multiplication is described by a [[convolution]]: if &lt;math&gt;a, b \in RC&lt;/math&gt; (thought of as functionals on the maps of ''C''), then their product is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(h) := \sum_{fg=h} a(f)b(g).&lt;/math&gt;
The latter sum is finite because the functions are finitely supported, and therefore &lt;math&gt;a * b \in RC&lt;/math&gt;.

===Incidence algebra-style definition===
The definition used for incidence algebras assumes that the category ''C'' is locally finite (see below), is ''dual'' to the above definition, and defines a ''different'' object. This isn't a useful assumption for groups, as a group that is locally finite as a category is finite.

A '''locally finite category''' is one where every map can be written only finitely many ways as a product of non-identity maps.
The category algebra (in this sense) is defined as above, but allowing all coefficients to be non-zero.

In terms of formal sums, the elements are all formal sums
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{f_i \in \mathrm{Hom}(C)} a_i f_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where there are no restrictions on the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; (they can all be non-zero).

In terms of functions, the elements are any functions from the maps of ''C'' to ''R'', and multiplication is defined as convolution. The sum in the convolution is always finite because of the local finiteness assumption.

===Dual===
The module dual of the category algebra (in the group algebra sense of the definition) is the space of all maps from the maps of ''C'' to ''R'', denoted ''F''(''C''), and has a natural [[coalgebra]] structure. Thus for a locally finite category, the dual of a category algebra (in the group algebra sense) is the category algebra (in the incidence algebra sense), and has both an algebra and coalgebra structure.

==Examples==
* If ''C'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (thought of as a [[groupoid]] with a single object), then ''RC'' is the [[group ring|group algebra]].
* If ''C'' is a [[monoid]] (thought of as a category with a single object), then ''RC'' is the [[monoid ring]].
* If ''C'' is a [[partially ordered set]], then (using the appropriate definition), ''RC'' is the [[incidence algebra]].
* The path algebra of a [[quiver]] Q is the category algebra of the [[free category]] on Q.

The '''Civil Rights Game''' was an annual [[Major League Baseball]] game that honors the history of [[civil rights]] in the [[United States]] and marked the unofficial end to the league's [[spring training]].

The first Civil Rights game was played in 2007 .The first two games were held at [[AutoZone Park]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The intent of the game was to "embrace baseball's history of [[African-American]] players", as well as to generate interest for future black players, after a demographics survey revealed that the percentage of black players in the league has dwindled over the past twelve years to just 8.4 percent.&lt;ref name="8.4 percent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Only 8.4 Percent of Major Leaguers Were Black Last Season|url=http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/story?storyId=2818145|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=mobile ESPN.com|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also gave the diversity of players in Major League Baseball an A+ grade: while African-Americans in the sport since 1996 dropped from 17 percent to 8 percent, the percentage of Hispanic players (many of them blacks from the Caribbean) increased during that period from 20 percent to 29 percent, and Asian and other minorities increased from 1 percent to 3 percent. The percentage of non-Hispanic white players went down from 62 percent to 60 percent during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lapchick|first1=Richard|last2=Ekiyor|first2=Boma|last3=Ruiz|first3=Horacio|title=The 2006 Racial and Gender Report Card: Major League Baseball|url=http://www.tidesport.org/RGRC/2006/2006_RGRC_MLB.pdf|website=[[University of Central Florida College of Business Administration]]|publisher=The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES)|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the game became a regular season game. It has not been held since 2016, for reasons unknown.

Baseball Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] commented on air during the first Civil Rights game that the 8 percent total for African-Americans was "a problem that needed to be looked at." [[Associated Press]] news releases related to the game focused on the drop in African-Americans, and quoted former Cleveland pitcher [[CC Sabathia]] on the idea that baseball must do more to promote the game in inner cities, saying, "It's not just a problem—it's a crisis."&lt;ref name="8.4 percent"/&gt;

In conjunction with the Civil Rights Game, Major League Baseball honors three pioneers of civil rights with the Beacon Awards (Beacon of Life Award, Beacon of Change Award and Beacon of Hope Award).

==Game summaries==

===2000s===

====Inaugural game====
The inaugural game was played on Saturday, March 31, 2007 at 5:30 p.m. and was broadcast nationally on [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] and [[ESPNHD]]. It was announced by ESPN's #1 broadcast team of [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]], with [[Peter Gammons]] serving as a field analyst (his role during ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' telecasts on ESPN). The game featured the [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. Both teams wore uniforms reminiscent of those worn in [[Negro League]] games. The Cardinals won 5&amp;ndash;1, receiving a solid five-inning start out of their 2006 closer [[Adam Wainwright]], who got the [[Win (baseball)|win]].

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:ALC-CLE-Insignia.png|right|150px|thumb|Controversial [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] logo: [[Chief Wahoo]].]] --&gt;
Selig came under heavy fire from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, who feel that the involvement of the [[Cleveland Indians]] was a slap in the face to the [[Cherokee]] people who still live in the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area after the infamous [[Trail of Tears]] passed through less than 200 years ago. The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called the situation a "primer on how to inadvertently stage an ironic insult to a local and large population of Natives" and insinuated that the league has (inadvertently) sabotaged the game by inviting the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/2007/03/08/2007-03-08_seligs_uncivil_wrong-2.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Selig's Uncivil Wrong | date=March 8, 2007 | first=Filip | last=Bondy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sports blog [[Deadspin]] asked the question "If the Indians win, do Native Americans get civil rights?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If The Indians Win, Do Native Americans Get Civil Rights?|url=http://deadspin.com/248670/if-the-indians-win-do-native-americans-get-civil-rights|website=[[Deadspin]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=October 3, 2014|format=Blog|date=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008 game====
On December 3, 2007, league officials announced details for the second annual game. It was played on March 29, 2008. The [[2008 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] beat the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] 3&amp;ndash;2.  [[Martin Luther King III]] threw out the first pitch.  This has been the lowest attended game, to date, primarily because it was held at a minor league park during cool, rainy weather.

====2009 game====
On June 20, 2009, the Civil Rights Game was played for the first time as part of the regular season schedule.  The game took place at [[Great American Ball Park]] in [[Cincinnati]] between the host [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] and the [[2009 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. The White Sox defeated the Reds, 10&amp;ndash;8.  For this game, the teams wore replicas of their 1965 uniforms.  The White Sox became the first team to participate in two Civil Rights Games. The game was broadcast on [[MLB Network]] except in the home markets of the two teams that played in the game, Cincinnati ([[FSN Ohio]]) and Chicago ([[CSN Chicago]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masilak|first1=Jim|title=Baseball Says Civil Rights Game Will Move to Cincinnati For 2009|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/source-says-civil-rights-game-will-move-cincinnati|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[The Commercial Appeal]]|publisher=[[The E.W.

===2010s===

====2010 game====
Cincinnati again hosted the Civil Rights Game on May 15, 2010. The Reds defeated the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in a dramatic 4–3 game that ended when Reds SS Orlando Cabrera took a relay throw from LF Chris Heisey at the base of the left field wall and gunned down Skip Schumaker at home plate trying to score the tying run from first base on Joe Mather's double.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strong Throw Helps Reds Take Out Cardinals|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=300515117|accessdate=October 3, 2014|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]/[[STATS LLC]]|date=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both teams wore replicas of their 1954 uniforms for this game, the first season both teams [[List of first black Major League Baseball players by team and date|fielded their first black players]]. Again, MLB Network telecast the game except in Cincinnati (Fox Sports Ohio) and St. Louis ([[Fox Sports Midwest]]).

====2011 game====
During the 2010 season, it was announced that [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] had been selected to host the 2011 and 2012 Civil Rights Games at [[Turner Field]], home of the [[2011 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Atlanta Braves to host 2011 and 2012 Civil Rights Game Weekends |publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.

Additionally, the festivities have been expanded from two days to four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowman|first1=Mark|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110112&amp;content_id=16429522&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;c_id=atl|title=Civil Rights Game to Feature Braves, Phillies|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] carried the game outside the Philadelphia and Atlanta [[Media market|DMA]]s.

For the Civil Rights Game, the Braves and the Phillies wore their 1974 throwback jerseys to honor [[Hank Aaron]]'s record-breaking 715th home run in 1974 as a member of the Atlanta Braves. In the previous game of the series, both teams wore [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] uniforms from their respective cities, the [[Atlanta Black Crackers]] for the Braves and the [[Philadelphia Stars (baseball)|Philadelphia Stars]] for the Phillies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first= Kyle|url=http://www.crossingbroad.com/2011/05/phillies-will-wear-1974-throwbacks-on-sunday.html

The game was a pitching duel against two of the National League's best pitchers, [[Tim Hudson]] of the Braves and [[Roy Halladay]] of the Phillies. Both pitchers had very good starts, with Hudson going seven and giving up just two runs on a [[John Mayberry Jr.]] home run. Halladay worked eight innings, giving up a leadoff eighth-inning home run to [[Dan Uggla]] to put the Braves in front. [[Craig Kimbrel]] of the Braves closed the game out, earning his tenth save of the season.

====2012 game====
Like the 2011 Game, the 2012 Game was held at [[Turner Field]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. The Atlanta Braves organization announced on February 21 that the game would be the August 19 series finale versus the [[2012 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The three-game weekend series from August 17 to 19 will again be incorporated into the Civil Rights Game Weekend, an event that will honor those on and off the field who have paved the way for equal rights for all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120221&amp;content_id=26773698&amp;vkey=pr_atl&amp;c_id=atl|title=Atlanta Braves 2012 Single Game Tickets|work=atlantabraves.com|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 game====
The 2013 Game was held at [[US Cellular Field]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] on August 24, when the [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] beat the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] by a score of 3–2.

====2014 game====
It was announced on November 19, 2013 that the 2014 Game will be held at [[Minute Maid Park]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] on May 30, when the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] host the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]]. Houston beat Baltimore 2–1. For the game, the Astros were known as the Houston Eagles (after the only Negro League team in Texas) and Baltimore played as the Baltimore Elite Giants.

====2015 game====
The 2015 Game was held on April 15 at [[Dodger Stadium]] in [[Los Angeles]] which saw the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] host the [[Seattle Mariners|Mariners]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13296">'''Civil liberties in the United States''' are certain unalienable rights retained by (as opposed to privileges granted to) citizens of the United States under the [[Constitution of the United States]], as interpreted and clarified by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and lower federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontheissues.org/askme/civil_liberties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil liberties]] are simply defined as individual legal and constitutional protections from entities more powerful than an individual, for example, parts of the government, other individuals, or corporations. The liberties explicitly defined, make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the [[right to privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://public.findlaw.com/civil-rights/civil-rights-basics/civil-rights-vs-liberties.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many liberties of people not defined in the Constitution, as stated in the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]: ''The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'' 

The extent of civil liberties and the periphery of the population of the United States who had access to these liberties has expanded over time. For example, the Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only [[White American|white]] male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kenneth|last1=Janda|first2=Jeffrey M.|last2=Berry|first3=Jerry|last3=Goldman|title=The challenge of democracy: government in America|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780618990948|page=207|edition=9. ed., update|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ_iZMofnl0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '[[Three-Fifths Compromise]]' allowed the southern slaveholders to consolidate power and maintain slavery in America for eighty years after the ratification of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"We Hold These Truths to be Self-evident;" An Interdisciplinary Analysis of the Roots of Racism &amp; slavery in America Kenneth N.

[[United States free speech exceptions|The following types of speech are not protected constitutionally]]: defamation or false statements, child pornography, obscenity, damaging the national security interests, verbal acts, and fighting words. Because these categories fall outside of the First Amendment privileges, the courts can legally restrict or criminalize any expressive act within them.

===Sexual freedom===
The concept of sexual freedom includes a broad range of different rights that are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. The idea of sexual freedom has sprung more from the popular opinion of society in more recent years, and has had very little Constitutional backing. The following liberties are included under sexual freedom: sexual expression, sexual choices, sexual education, reproductive justice, and sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glaa.org/archive/2010/woodhullreport1019.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual freedom in general is considered an implied procedure, and is not mentioned in the Constitution.  

Sexual freedoms include the freedom to have consensual sex with whomever a person chooses, at any time, for any reason, provided the person is of the age of majority. Marriage is not required, nor are there any requirements as to the gender or number of people you have sex with. Sexual freedom includes the freedom to have private consensual homosexual sex (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'').

'''Civilian control of the military''' is a doctrine in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] that places ultimate [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for a [[Country|country's]] [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Group decision making|decision-making]] in the hands of the [[civilian]] [[politics|political]] [[leadership]], rather than professional [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a [[military dictatorship]]. A lack of control over the military may result in a [[state within a state]]. One author, paraphrasing [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s writings in ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'', has summarized the civilian control ideal as "the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Edward R. ''[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA346358 Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs]'' ([[pdf]]), [[United States Navy]] [[Postgraduate]] School thesis. 1998: 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable [[liberal democracy]]. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a [[democracy]] governed by [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, though the subordination of the military to [[politics|political control]] is not unique to these societies. One example is the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Mao Zedong]] stated that "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party," reflecting the primacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] (and [[Communist party|communist parties]] in general) as decision-makers in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] theories of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name=Mao-War&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], English language translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_12.htm Problems of War and Strategy]''. 1938. (''See also: [[q:Mao Zedong|Wikiquote: Mao Zedong]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] professor [[Richard H. Kohn]], "civilian control is not a fact but a process".&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, Richard H. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html An Essay on Civilian Control of the Military]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military [[commander]]s are expected to translate into [[military operation|operational]] plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing [[politician]]s. [[Head of government|National Leaders]] with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the [[operational art|art]] and [[military science|science]] of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.

Advocates of civilian control generally take a [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] view of [[war]], emphasizing its [[policy|political]] character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[wikiquote:Georges Clemenceau|words]] of [[Georges Clemenceau]], "War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men" (also frequently rendered as "War is too important to be left to the [[general]]s"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad [[military strategy|strategic]] decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the [[citizen]]s of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their [[representative government|political representatives]]), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The [[military]] serves as a special [[government agency]], which is supposed to ''implement'', rather than ''formulate'', policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.&lt;ref name=Kohn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[State (polity)|state's]] effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their [[authority]]. The danger of granting military leaders full [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a [[coup]] or [[military dictatorship]]. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic [[political opposition]] through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair [[election]]s, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver.  1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control."  [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html |title=Kohn: Civilian Control |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] and almost everyone in high positions were military people like [[Hideki Tojo]], and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===
Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were suspicious of [[Standing army|standing militaries]].  As [[Samuel Adams]] wrote in 1768, "Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it".&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;Cairo, Michael F. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026185242/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/democracy/dmpaper12.htm Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military]'', [[U.S. Department of State]] International Information Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more forceful are the words of [[Elbridge Gerry]], a [[delegate]] to the American [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], who wrote that "[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism."&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 8]], one of ''[[The Federalist]]'' papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking.  In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall.  Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army.  The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division.  He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of many of ''The Federalist'' papers,&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate.  Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.  The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.  Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended.  Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911.  ''[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwfr.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787]''.  New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]].  Coming from a tradition of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|legislative superiority in government]], many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war.  Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty.  James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable.  In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.  Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders.  Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing.  Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.  These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence.  While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels.  However, with the advent of the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force "engendered new concerns" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect [[civil–military relations]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecommons.txstate.edu"&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2009.  ''Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel''. ''[http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/51 Faculty Publications – Political Science]''. Paper 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic law enforcement===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- do similar laws exist in other countries? --&gt;

The United States' [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority.  Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them.  The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] versus the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.

The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case.  For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States.  The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a "posse" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.&lt;ref name=Hendell&gt;Hendell, Garri B. "[http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/336]" "Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order—posse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 {{doi|10.1093/publius/pjq014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement.  Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern.  As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] forces under state control i.e., that state's [[Army National Guard]] and/or [[Air National Guard]] are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard "federalized" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include "federal" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.

===Maoist approach===
[[Maoism|Maoist]] military-political theories of [[people's war]] and [[democratic centralism]] also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the [[communist party]] (although the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] experience of many early leading [[Communist Party of China]] figures may make their status as [[civilian]]s somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay ''On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party'', [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] explicitly refuted "comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks", prescribing increased scrutiny of the [[People's Liberation Army]] by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy &lt;ref name=Mao-Party&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], [[English language]] translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_5.htm On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party]''. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Mao's &lt;!-- in all Communist?--&gt;theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the [[revolution]] and an instrument of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the [[People's Republic of China]] through the [[Central Military Commission]]), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.

== Methods of asserting civilian control ==
[[Image:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|An immensely popular hero of [[World War II]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s public insistence on the need to expand the [[Korean War]], over the objections of President [[Harry S. Truman]], led to [[Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur|the termination]] of his [[Command (military formation)|command]].]]

Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian [[police]] force, [[militia]], or other [[paramilitary]] group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian [[gun]] ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a [[Gun politics#Balance of power|balance of power]] in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.

===A civilian commander-in-chief===
The establishment of a civilian [[head of state]], [[head of government]] or other government figure as the military's [[commander-in-chief]] within the [[chain of command]] is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.

In the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] (in the [[War Powers Clause]]), while [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution establishes the [[President of the United States|President]] as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control.  Three examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s dismissal of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] in the [[American Civil War]] when McClellan failed to pursue the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Harry S. Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieving]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of command in the [[Korean War]] after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and [[Barack Obama]]'s acceptance of [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]'s resignation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] after a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].

=== Composition of the military ===
Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In ''The Soldier and the State'', [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] argued for what he termed "objective civilian control", "focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps".&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an [[esprit de corps]] and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the [[citizen-soldier]] holds that "civilianizing" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent "[[caste]]" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen [[militia]], which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a less [[egalitarian]] practice, societies may also blur the line between "civilian" and "military" leadership by making direct appointments of non-[[profession]]als (frequently social elites benefitting from [[patronage]] or [[nepotism]]) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], involves active monitoring of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] through the appointment of [[political commissar]]s, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular [[job rotation|rotation]] of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular [[military unit]]. Some governments place responsibility for approving [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] seeking advancement through the ranks.

=== Technological developments ===
[[Image:Bombing in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|During the term of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the President and his advisors often chose specific [[bomb]]ing targets in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] on the basis of larger [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch4c.htm "Washington's Management of the Rolling  Thunder Campaign"], M. Jacobsen, ''US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of [[command, control, and communications]]; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a [[military campaign]], or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the [[front lines]]. The remoteness of government from the action allowed [[professional soldier]]s to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the [[general]]s and [[field marshal]]s would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.

Improvements in [[information technology]] and its application to wartime [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] (a process sometimes labeled the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the [[theater (military)|theater of conflict]] to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. [[Precision-guided munition]]s and real-time [[videoconferencing]] with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the [[:wikt:tactical|tactical]] decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.

=== Restrictions on Political Activities ===
In the United States the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.

=== Political officers ===

{{main|political commissar}}

Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] rather than liberal democracies.

== Military dislike of political directives ==

While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of [[military dictatorship]]s, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue "politicization" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like "Defeat Country X"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.

===Case study: United States===
The "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the "[[CNN effect]]". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawks]]" by those who disagree with their political goals.

In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of [[regulatory capture]] as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the "[[Weinberger doctrine|Weinberger Doctrine]]", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the [[Vietnam War]] (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of "vital national interest", "as a last resort", and, as [[Powell Doctrine|updated]] by [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s disciple [[Colin Powell]], with "overwhelming force". The process of setting [[List of countries by military expenditures|military budgets]] forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active [[lobbying]] by rival military services for a share of the national budget.

Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian [[United States Department of Energy]], not by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over [[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]] led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.

During his tenure, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the [[Vietnam war]] experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''Conservation photography''' is the active use of the [[photographic process]] and its products, within the parameters of [[photojournalism]], to [[advocate]] for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] outcomes.

Conservation photography combines [[nature photography]] with the proactive, issue-oriented approach of [[documentary photography]] as an agent for protecting [[nature]] and improving the [[biosphere]] and [[natural environment]]. Conservation Photography furthers [[environmental conservation]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[habitat conservation]] or cultural conservation by expanding public awareness of issues and stimulating remedial action.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example are the powerful images of [[Carleton Watkins]] which were successfully used to stimulate the establishment of [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1864 and [[William Henry Jackson]] and [[Ansel Adams]] who advocated for expansion and continued funding of the park.

Renewed emphasis on photography-for-conservation arose at the beginning of the 21st century, primarily in response to the human-caused [[environmental crisis]], recognizing that the global pattern of [[ecosystem]] degradation was not sustainable.

The modern field of conservation photography was formalized in October 2005 with the founding of the [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] by photographer [[Cristina Mittermeier]], during the 8th [[World Wilderness Congress]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. Prior to 2005 "conservation photography" was not widely recognized as a discipline.

Conservation and photography appear as two distinct fields, but their combined impact can be profound. Simply put, conservation photography is photography that empowers or enables conservation.

According to the acclaimed photographer, [[Joel Sartore]], “the typical nature photograph shows a butterfly on a pretty flower. The conservation photograph shows the same thing, but with a bulldozer coming at it in the background. This doesn’t mean there’s no room for beautiful pictures, in fact we need beautiful images just as much as the issues. It does mean that the images exist for a reason; to save the Earth while we still can.”

The serious conservation photographer brings to their work a deep empathy for the natural world. Proper use of the resulting images has the power to bring about positive change.

Conservation photographs fall into two broad categories, both of which are equally valuable:

*The snapshot: upon seeing a striking scene one pulls out a cell phone or point-and-shoot camera, and snaps some quick framed pictures without expending too much time or effort.
*The carefully crafted image:: One sees the same scene, but instead of quickly shooting it and moving on, they take a series of skillfully crafted, high-quality images that tell the story in a more powerful way. Dramatic framing enhances the influence of a picture.

Such photographs have a stronger impact on the audience. One may also proactively seek opportunities to take crafted conservation pictures. Determined effort can result in excellent photo stories that can move people’s hearts and minds.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Gp-esso.jpg|thumb|Photo of [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[Esso]] /[[ExxonMobil in 2003]]]]
[[File:2011 flooding in Ayutthaya Province-EO-1 merged.jpg|thumb|True-colour [[satellite image]] showing [[flood]]ing in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani Provinces in Central [[Thailand]] (right), compared to before the flooding (left) in 2011]]
In order to create an impact, conservation pictures should be put to work for specific causes. Though not every picture may find an immediate use, a carefully catalogued archive of conservation pictures can help increase impact of conservation related news stories, provide material for public awareness campaigns, including [[internet activism]] and sometimes serve as [[Investigative journalism]] evidence in court proceedings. Images of habitat destruction, especially in [[protected area]]s, can be important as legal evidence against the activity.
;Specialty fields
Several specialty fields benefit from their use of conservation photography, these include:
* [[Conservation movement]], to protect animals, fungi, plants and their habitats

==Organizations==
There are many [[environmental organization]]s that effectively use conservation photography to help advocate their goals. Just a few are:


*[[ARKive]] is a global initiative with the mission of "promoting the conservation of the world's threatened species, through the power of wildlife imagery", which it does by locating and gathering films, photographs and audio recordings of the world's [[species]] into a centralised [[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]. Its current priority is the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the [[IUCN Red List]] of [[threatened species]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/about/|title=About ARKive|work=ARKive|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sanctuary Asia]] is [[India]]'s first and one of its leading [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[news magazine]]s. It was founded in 1981 to raise awareness among [[Indian people]] of their disappearing [[natural heritage]]. The magazine is attractively packaged&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, India, pp. 76; [[Lonely Planet]] Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with colored photographs. The ''Sanctuary Photo Library''' is a melting pot of natural history visuals, information and resources used to produce some of the finest wildlife and nature calendars, posters, slide shows, exhibitions and other products available in India.
*[[Sierra club]] maintains a publishing imprint, [[Sierra Club Books]], publishing books on environmental issues, wilderness photographic essays, nature guides, and other related subjects. They publish the Sierra Club Calendars, perennial bestsellers, featuring photographs by well-known nature photographers such as [[Galen Rowell]].
*The [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] (iLCP) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to furthering environmental and cultural conservation through ethical photography. A project-driven organization, it partners with leading conservation groups, scientists, and policy makers worldwide in order to produce high-quality documentary images that depict both the beauty of the natural world and the challenges it faces.

In mathematics, a '''Δ-set''' ''S'', often called a '''semi-simplicial set''', is a [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] object that is useful in the construction and [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of [[topological space]]s, and also in the computation of related [[Invariant theory|algebraic invariants]] of such spaces.  A Δ-set is somewhat more general than a [[simplicial complex]], yet not quite as general as a [[simplicial set]].

==Definition and related data==
Formally, a '''Δ-set''' is a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;\{S_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; together with maps

:&lt;math&gt;d_i : S_{n+1} \rightarrow S_n &lt;/math&gt;

with ''i'' = 0,1,...,''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 for ''n'' ≥ 1 that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; d_i \circ d_j = d_{j-1} \circ d_i &lt;/math&gt;
whenever ''i &lt; j''.

This definition generalizes the notion of a simplicial complex, where the &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; are the sets of ''n''-simplices, and the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the face maps.  It is not as general as a simplicial set, since it lacks "degeneracies."

Given Δ-sets ''S'' and ''T'', a '''map of Δ-sets''' is a collection
:&lt;math&gt; \{ f_n: S_n \rightarrow T_n \}_{n=0}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt; f_n \circ d_i = d_i \circ f_{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;
whenever both sides of the equation are defined.  With this notion, we can define the '''[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of Δ-sets''', whose objects are Δ-sets and whose morphisms are maps of Δ-sets.

Each Δ-set has a corresponding '''geometric realization''', defined as
:&lt;math&gt;|S| = \left( \coprod_{n=0}^{\infty} S_n \times \Delta^n \right)/_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt;
where we declare that

: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma,d^i t) \sim (d_i \sigma, t) \quad \text{ for all} \quad \sigma \in S_n, t \in \Delta^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Simplex#The standard simplex|standard ''n''-simplex]], and

:&lt;math&gt; d^i : \Delta^{n-1} \rightarrow \Delta^n &lt;/math&gt;

is the inclusion of the ''i''-th face.  The geometric realization is a topological space with the [[quotient topology]].

The geometric realization of a Δ-set ''S'' has a natural [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]]
: &lt;math&gt;|S|_0 \subset |S|_1 \subset \cdots \subset |S|, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;|S|_N = \left( \coprod_{n=0}^{N} S_n \times \Delta^n \right)/_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt;
is a "restricted" geometric realization.

==Related functors==
The geometric realization of a Δ-set described above defines a covariant [[functor]] from the category of Δ-sets to the category of topological spaces.  Geometric realization takes a Δ-set to a topological space, and carries maps of Δ-sets to induced continuous maps between geometric realizations (which are topological spaces).

If ''S'' is a Δ-set, there is an associated free abelian [[chain complex]], denoted &lt;math&gt;( \mathbb{Z} S, \partial )&lt;/math&gt;, whose ''n''-th group is the [[free abelian group]]
: &lt;math&gt; (\mathbb{Z} S)_n = \mathbb{Z} \langle S_n \rangle, &lt;/math&gt;
generated by the set &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, and whose ''n''-th differential is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; \partial_n = d_0 - d_1 + d_2 - \cdots + (-1)^n d_n. &lt;/math&gt;

This defines a covariant functor from the category of Δ-sets to the category of chain complexes of abelian groups.  A Δ-set is carried to the chain complex just described, and a map of Δ-sets is carried to a map of chain complexes, which is defined by extending the map of Δ-sets in the standard way using the [[universal property]] of free abelian groups.

Given any topological space ''X'', one can construct a Δ-set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sing}(X)&lt;/math&gt; as follows.  A singular ''n''-simplex in ''X'' is a continuous map

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma : \Delta^n \rightarrow X. &lt;/math&gt;

Define

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{sing}_n^{}(X) &lt;/math&gt;

to be the collection of all singular ''n''-simplicies in ''X'', and define

:&lt;math&gt;d_i : \mathrm{sing}_{i+1}(X) \rightarrow \mathrm{sing}_i(X) &lt;/math&gt;

by

:&lt;math&gt; d_i(\sigma) = \sigma \circ d^i,&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''i''-th face map.  One can check that this is in fact a Δ-set.  This defines a covariant functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of Δ-sets.  A topological space is carried to the Δ-set just described, and a continuous map of spaces is carried to a map of Δ-sets, which is given by composing the map with the singular ''n''-simplices.

==An example==
This example illustrates the constructions described above.  We can create a Δ-set ''S'' whose geometric realization is the unit circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;, and use it to compute the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of this space.  Thinking of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; as an interval with the endpoints identified, define
:&lt;math&gt; S_0 = \{v\}, \quad S_1 = \{e\}, &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;S_n = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n ≥ 2''.  The only possible maps &lt;math&gt;d_0,d_1:S_1 \rightarrow S_0,&lt;/math&gt; are
:&lt;math&gt; d_0(e) = d_1(e) = v. \quad&lt;/math&gt;
It is simple to check that this is a Δ-set, and that &lt;math&gt;|S| \cong S^1&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, the associated chain complex &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}S,\partial)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \langle e \rangle \stackrel{\partial_1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \langle v \rangle \longrightarrow 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_1(e) = d_0(e) - d_1(e) = v - v = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
In fact, &lt;math&gt;\partial_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''.  The homology of this chain complex is also simple to compute:
:&lt;math&gt; H_0(\mathbb{Z}S) = \frac{\ker \partial_0}{\mathrm{im} \partial_1} = \mathbb{Z} \langle v \rangle \cong \Z, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; H_1(\mathbb{Z}S) = \frac{\ker \partial_1}{\mathrm{im} \partial_2} = \mathbb{Z} \langle e \rangle \cong \Z. &lt;/math&gt;
All other homology groups are clearly trivial.

One advantage of using Δ-sets in this way is that the resulting chain complex is generally much simpler than the singular chain complex.  For reasonably simple spaces, all of the groups will be finitely generated, whereas the singular chain groups are, in general, not even countably generated.

One drawback of this method is that one must prove that the geometric realization of the Δ-set is actually [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the topological space in question.  This can become a computational challenge as the Δ-set increases in complexity.

'''''Desert Island Discs''''' is a radio programme broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. It was first broadcast on the [[BBC Forces Programme]] on 29 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9045319/Desert-Island-Discs-Britains-longest-running-radio-show.html|title=Desert Island Discs: Britain's longest-running radio show |work=The Telegraph |date=29 January 2012 |location=London |first=Neil |last=Midgley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each week a guest, called a '[[castaway]]' during the programme, is asked to choose eight recordings (usually, but not always, music), a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a [[desert island]], whilst discussing their lives and the reasons for their choices. It was devised and originally presented by [[Roy Plomley]]. Since 2006, the programme has been presented by [[Kirsty Young]].

More than 3,000 episodes have been recorded, with some guests having appeared more than once and some episodes featuring more than one guest.&lt;ref name="FaC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway|title=Desert Island Discs – Find a castaway|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a guest who falls into both categories is [[Bob Monkhouse]], who appeared with his co-writer [[Denis Goodwin]] on 12 December 1955 and in his own right on 20 December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway?q=bob+monkhouse&amp;type=all|title=Desert Island Discs – Find a castaway|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Guests are invited to imagine themselves [[castaway|cast away]] on a [[desert island]], and choose eight recordings, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life. Excerpts from their choices are played or, in the case of short pieces, the whole work. At the end of the programme they choose the one piece they regard most highly. Guests are also automatically given the ''[[Complete Works of Shakespeare]]'' and either the [[Bible]] or another appropriate religious or philosophical work. They are then prompted to select a third book to accompany them. Popular choices include [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Jane Austen]]. Actress [[Judi Dench]], who suffers from [[macular degeneration]], was permitted to take an [[audiobook]] in place of a printed manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/11218144/Desert-Island-Discs-racks-up-a-milestone-of-delights.html |title=Desert Island Discs racks up a milestone of delights |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06bd681 |title=BBC Radio 4 – Desert Island Discs, Dame Judi Dench |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-09-25 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guests also choose one luxury, which must be inanimate and of no use in escaping the island or allowing communication from outside. [[Roy Plomley]]&lt;ref name = "DID BBC 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1787472.stm

The first castaway was [[Vic Oliver]], and several castaways, including [[Celia Johnson]], [[Arthur Askey]], [[Trevor Nunn]], [[John Schlesinger]], [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Terry Wogan]], [[Brian Rix]], [[David Attenborough]] and [[Adele Leigh]] have been cast away more than once. The most requested piece of music over the first 60 years was "Ode to Joy", the last movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1879322.stm "Beethoven tops island hit list"], BBC News, 18 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most remarked broadcasts was [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]]'s 1958 selection of seven of her own recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8355952/Desert-Island-Discs-most-popular-requests.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Laura | last=Roberts | title=Desert Island Discs' most popular requests | date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = Elisabeth Schwarzkopf |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/51ed3e16#p009y865 |series = Desert Island Discs |network = BBC Radio 4 |airdate = 28 July 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record was subsequently beaten by British pianist Dame [[Moura Lympany]] on her second appearance on the programme on 28 July 1979 when all eight of her selections were of her own recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = Dame Moura Lympany |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/35a36972#p009mx7g |series = Desert Island Discs |network = BBC Radio 4 |airdate = 28 July 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Roy Plomley attempted to interview [[Alistair MacLean]], but ended up speaking to somebody else with the same name – and the programme was never broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pile|first=Stephen|title=The Book of Heroic Failures|edition=1980|pages=29–30|publisher=Futura|ISBN=0-7088-1908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1981, [[Princess Margaret|HRH Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], appeared as a castaway on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mvhf|title=HRH Princess Margaret, Desert Island Discs - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening theme==
Plomley originally wanted the sounds of "surf breaking on a shore and the cries of sea birds" to open and close each programme. But Leslie Prowne, the head of popular record programmes at the [[BBC]], was concerned that it lacked definition and insisted that music should also be used. Plomley and the series' producer Frederic Piffard selected "[[By the Sleepy Lagoon]]", composed by [[Eric Coates]] (who appeared on the show in 1951). The tune has been used since the first transmission in 1942. The sound of [[herring gulls]] has accompanied the music except for a period of time in 1964 when tropical bird sounds were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magee |first=Sean |title= Desert Island Discs: 70 Years Of Castaways |publisher=Bantam Press |date=13 September 2012 |page=8 |chapter=Chapter 2:1940s |isbn=978-0-593-07006-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright status==
Until late September 2009, ''Desert Island Discs'' could not be heard on the BBC's [[iPlayer]] service, which allows most programmes to be heard up to a week after transmission. The programme's website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs.shtml |title=Desert Island Discs – Home |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that this was due to rights issues, as explained in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article681767.ece|title=How a man in his pyjamas invented a radio classic|work=The Sunday Times |date=2 July 2006 | accessdate=25 February 2011|location=London|first=Charles|last=Bremner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 27 September 2009 that an agreement had been reached as a result of which the programme would be available to stream via the iPlayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2009/09/desert_island_discs_iplayer.html |author=Mark Damazer|title=BBC – Radio 4 Blog: Desert Island Discs comes to iPlayer |publisher=BBC |date=27 September 2009|accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode available through the iPlayer was with [[Barry Manilow]]. Subsequently, the programme was also made available as a podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/28/desert-island-discs-bbc-iplayer |title=BBC launches Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on iPlayer |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=28 September 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the edition broadcast on 29 November 2009, which featured [[Morrissey]]. However, due to music clearance issues, the music selections on the podcast versions are reduced to only playing for around 30 seconds or so (and in rare instances are unavailable, as mentioned in an announcement made by Kirsty Young at the appropriate point of the programme).

On 30 March 2011, the BBC placed more than 500 episodes from the show's archive online to listen to via iPlayer. Other episodes have since been added, both new and old.

In the early years of the BBC, programmes were broadcast live and were generally not recorded. This, in addition to the BBC's policy of [[wiping]] that was applied during the 1950s and 1960s, means very few episodes from the first 20 years of the show are known to exist; the earliest episode still in existence is from 1951 and features actress [[Margaret Lockwood]]. Several extracts were preserved for posterity at the request of the guests, such as an extract featuring [[Alfred Hitchcock]] where he speaks about his films ''[[The Pleasure Garden (film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925) and ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), gives his view on the changing landscape of the film industry and briefly discusses his then upcoming film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).

{{About|dignity as a matter of philosophy, religion, human rights, law and medicine}}

'''Dignity''' is the [[Rights|right]] of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[law]] and [[politics]] as an extension of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concepts of [[Inalienable right#Debate|inherent, inalienable rights]]. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in "behaving with dignity".

== Etymology ==
The English word "dignity", attested from the early 13th century, comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''dignitas'' (worthiness)&lt;ref&gt;

by way of [[French language|French]] ''dignité''.&lt;ref name = "DIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dignity|title=Dignity - Define Dignity at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
English-speakers often use the word "dignity" in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example, in politics it can be used to critique the treatment of oppressed and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, and even to animals used for food or research.

"Dignity" also has descriptive meanings pertaining to the ''worth'' of human beings. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.&lt;ref name="Shultziner, D. Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings. Global Jurist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|title=Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings|journal=Global Jurist|date=2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–21|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doron_Shultziner/publication/241002874_Human_Dignity_Functions_and_Meanings/links/00b7d522ad17e53070000000.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordinary modern usage, the word denotes "respect" and "status", and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect, or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect. There is also a long history of special [[philosophical]] use of this term. However, it is rarely defined outright in political, legal, and scientific discussions.  International proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined,&lt;ref&gt;
"Those provisions concerning human dignity have not been authoritatively interpreted or applied by any of the competent, independent, international institutions." Bartha Maria Knoppers, ''Human Dignity and Genetic Heritage: Study Paper'' (Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1991), note, at 23. None of the international proclamations make dignity the rare quality that some commentators say it should be.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980), note, at 376.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and scientific commentators, such as those arguing against genetic research and [[algeny]], cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Comment added 29 March 2011: I searched through several major libraries including Harvard and the US Library of Congress, and did not find this title&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Aldergrove says dignity means ''the set of attributes that distinguish an intelligent, solemn, sober, healthy, independent, adult homo sapiens (the model adult) from someone else, especially a young child or a lunatic''. J. R. Aldergrove, ''Why We Are Not Obsolete Yet: Genetics, Algeny, and the Future'' (Stentorian: Burnaby, 2000) at 71.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- hiding ref for the moment&lt;ref&gt; Thurber says dignity "has gleamed only now and then and here and there, in lonely splendor, throughout the ages, a hope of the better men, never an achievement of the majority."

(Harper &amp; Row, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Violations ==

=== Categories ===
Human dignity can be violated in multiple ways.  The main categories of violations are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Humiliation, Degradation, Dehumanization: Human Dignity Violated | isbn=9789048196616 | editors=Paulus Kaufmann, Hannes Kuch, Christian Neuhäuser, and Elaine Webster | publisher=Springer }} &lt;!-- Entire book, but especially pages 51–52, 151, 168 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Humiliation]]
Violations of human dignity in terms of humiliation refer to acts that humiliate or diminish the self-worth of a person or a group. Acts of humiliation are context dependent but we normally have an intuitive understanding where such a violation occurs. As Schachter noted, “it has been generally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized even if the abstract term cannot be defined. ‘I know it when I see it even if I cannot tell you what it is’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=Oskar|title=Human dignity as a normative concept|journal=American Journal of International Law|date=1983|volume=77|issue=4|page=849|doi=10.2307/2202536|jstor=2202536}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, etymology of the word “humiliation” has a universal characteristic in the sense that in all languages the word involves “downward spatial orientation” in which “something or someone is pushed down and forcefully held there”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=Evelin|title=Making enemies: Humiliation and international conflict|date=2006|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is common in judicial decisions where judges refer to violations of human dignity as injuries to people's self-worth or their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|last2=Rabinovici|first2=Itai|title=Human Dignity, Self-Worth and Humiliation: A Comparative Legal–Psychological Approach|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105|doi=10.1037/a0024585}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instrumentalization or [[objectification]]
This aspect refers to treating a person as an instrument or as means to achieve some other goal. This approach builds on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s moral imperative stipulating that we should treat people as ends or goals in themselves, namely as having ultimate moral worth which should not be instrumentalized.  
* Degradation
Violations of human dignity as degradation refer to acts that degrade the value of human beings. These are acts that, even if done by consent, convey a message that diminishes the importance or value of all human beings. They consist of practices that human beings should not be subjected to, regardless of whether subjective humiliation is involved, such as selling oneself to slavery, or when a state authority deliberately puts prisoners in inhuman living conditions. 
* [[Dehumanization]]
These are acts that strip a person or a group of their human characteristics. It may involve describing or treating them as animals or as a lower type of human beings. This has occurred in genocides such as the Holocaust and in Rwanda where the minority were compared to insects.

=== Examples ===
Some of the practices that violate human dignity include [[torture]], [[rape]], [[social exclusion]], [[labor exploitation]], [[bonded labor]], and [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  &lt;!-- If you add something to this list, please also add a source for it. --&gt;

Both absolute and relative poverty are violations of human dignity, although they also have other significant dimensions, such as social injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Absolute poverty]] is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (for example, being forced to eat food from other people's garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity even in the absence of more direct violations. [[Relative poverty]], on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.

Another example of violation of human dignity, especially for women in developing countries, is lack of [[sanitation]]. Having no access to [[toilet]]s leaves currently about 1 billion people of the world with no choice other than to [[open defecation|defecation in the open]], which has been declared by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations as an affront to personal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;JMP (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2036 Progress on drinking water and sanitation, 2014 Update]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), {{ISBN|978 92 4 150724 0}}, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Human dignity is also violated by the practice of employing people in India for "[[manual scavenging]]" of [[human excreta]] from unsanitary toilets{{snd}}usually by people of a lower [[caste]], and more often by women than men.&lt;ref name="HRW2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/india0814_ForUpload_0.pdf|title=Cleaning Human Waste: "manual scavenging", Caste and Discrimination in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example of violation of human dignity, affecting women mainly in developing countries, is [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).

The movie ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]'' depicts a wealthy man ([[Peter Sellers]]) and his son ([[Ringo Starr]]) who test the limits of dignity by forcing people to perform self-degrading acts for money.  The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer vs. Dignity]]" has a similar plot.

==Philosophical history==
[[File:Ripa dignity allegory.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Statue Depicting Dignity|Woodcut from [[Cesare Ripa|Cesare Ripa's]] Iconologia depicting the Allegory of Dignity]]

===Pico della Mirandola===
A philosopher of the Renaissance, [[Mirandola, Giovanni Francesco Pico della|Pico della Mirandola]], granted dignity to ideas and to beings. In his "[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]", he told hostile clerics about the dignity of the liberal arts and about the dignity and the glory of [[angel]]s. His comments implied the dignity of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Mirandola/|title=Redirection|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oration is commonly seen as one of the central texts of the [[Renaissance]], intimately tied with the growth of humanist philosophies.&lt;ref name="CrossLamm1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Neal Miller|author2=Robert Carson Lamm|author3=Rudy H.

===Kant===
A philosopher of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (18th century), [[Immanuel Kant]] held that there were things that should not be discussed in terms of value, and that these things could be said to have dignity.  '[[Value (ethics)|Value]]' is necessarily relative, because the value of something depends on a particular observer's judgment of that thing. Things that are ''not'' relative{{snd}}that are ''"ends in themselves"'', in Kant's terminology{{snd}}are by extension beyond all value, and a thing is an ''end in itself'' only if it has a moral dimension; if it represents a choice between right and wrong. In Kant's words: "[[Morality]], and [[human nature|humanity]] as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals'', trans. by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (Second Section: Transition From Popular Moral Philosophy To The Metaphysic Of Morals).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically with respect to human dignity, which his writings brought from relative obscurity in Western philosophy into a focal point for philosophers, Kant held that "free will" is essential; human dignity is related to human agency, the ability of humans to choose their own actions.&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip Anthony|title=Encyclopedia of political economy|chapter=Human dignity|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-18717-6|page=471}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth===
Philosophers of the late 20th century who have written significant works on the subject of dignity include [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Alan Gewirth]].&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt; Gewirth's views on human dignity are typically compared and contrasted with Kant's, for like Kant he theorizes that human dignity arises from agency.&lt;ref name="Peil2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Mark D.|chapter=Dignity|editor=Jan Peil|title=Handbook of Economics and Ethics|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-936-2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyleveldBrownsword2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beyleveld|first1=Deryck|author2=Roger Brownsword|title=Human dignity in bioethics and biolaw|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-826826-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while sharing Kant's view that rights arise from dignity, Gewirth focused far more than Kant on the positive obligations that dignity imposed on humans, the moral requirement not only to avoid harming but to actively assist one another in achieving and maintaining a state of "well being".&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt;

Among other topics, including the dignity of labor,&lt;ref name="AdlerWeismann2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=Mortimer Jerome|author2=Max Weismann|title=How to think about the great ideas: from the great books of western civilization|date=1 March 2000|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=978-0-8126-9412-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last=Adler |first=Mortimer |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |title=The Dignity of Man and the 21st century |date=1952-10-10 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620172623/http://cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}; {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes|year=1993|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-1535-5}}, {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=Six Great Ideas|date=1 December 1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82681-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dignity of man," he said, "is the dignity of the human being as a person—a dignity that is not possessed by things."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Dan Egonsson, followed by Roger Wertheimer, argued that while it is conventional for people to equate dignity with 'being human' (Egonsson's 'Standard Attitude', Wertheimer's 'Standard Belief'), people generally also import something other than mere humanness to their idea of dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Egonsson, ''Dimensions of Dignity: The Moral Importance of Being Human'' (Dordrecht, Sweden: Kluwer Academic, 1998) 132,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wertheimer, "Philosophy on Humanity," in ''Abortion: Pro and Con'', R. L. Perkins ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: Schenkman, 1974) 107-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Egonsson suggested that an entity must be both human and ''alive'' to merit an ascription of dignity, while Wertheimer states "it is not a definitional truth that human beings have human status."

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], dignity is opinion of others about our worth and subjective definition of dignity is our fear from this opinion of others.&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer. Essays and Aphorisms&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez has argued that human dignity is best understood as an essentially contested concept. As he argues, "it seems that it is this very nature of the concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Philippe-André|title=Human dignity as an essentially contested concept|journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs|date=2015|volume=28|issue=2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Human dignity is a central consideration of [[Christian philosophy]]&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Gal|3:28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:35-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] insists the "dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and [[Image of God|likeness]] of [[God]]." "All human beings," says the Church, "in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person." The catechism says, "The right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/index.htm|title=Vatican|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's view of human dignity is like Kant's insofar as it springs from human agency and free will,&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt; with the further understanding that free will in turn springs from human creation in the image of God.&lt;ref name="ccc1705"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect1.shtml|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|work=usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity, or ''kevod ha-beriyot'', is also a central consideration of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="WaxmanGinor1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waxman|first1=Mordecai|authorlink1=Mordecai Waxman|author2=Tseviyah Ben-Yosef Ginor|author3=Zvia Ginor|title=Yakar le'Mordecai|date=November 1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-632-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Talmud]]'' cautions against giving charity publicly rather than in private to avoid offending the dignity of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The political culture of Judaism|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97257-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] in his codification of ''[[Halakha]]'' cautioned judges to preserve the self-respect of people who came before them: "Let not human dignity be light in his eyes; for the respect due to man supersedes a negative rabbinical command".&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"/&gt;

An [[Islam]]ic view of dignity is crystallized in the Quran through the selected biographies of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, David, Moses, Mary, Jesus and others (differing from the narratives in the Bible, which the Quran claims were corrupted). Individuals such as these are presented as role-models of dignity because they did not abandon their self-respect by bowing to social pressures. When faced with the fear of disapproval, poverty, hunger, death etc. these individuals held firm in their sense of right and wrong, which was in-line with Divine ordinances. ''"The right course is that on which one keeps his attitudes, ambitions and requirements subjected to the Divine Laws; and in this way leads a balanced and graceful life. Such a person has grasped the most trustworthy support which will never fail him"'' (Quran 31:22)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405162608/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals are given the title of Muhsineen, who faced immense pressures but held firm in their positive actions. God awarded these individuals with authority and status in the land, and this reward is open to anyone who proves themselves worthy: ''"We bestow such honour and position on all those who lead their lives according to Our Laws."'' (Quran 37:80)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405163507/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall into this category are also afforded Divine protection from their mistakes: ''"Therefore We have saved you and your son from this.  We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps."'' (37:104-105)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"/&gt; The Quranic State that Muhammad began in Medinah sought to protect human dignity, since in a Quranic Welfare State individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey God's Laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity's full potential. Elaborations on dignity have been made by many scholars of Islam, such as [[Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri]], head of the Islamic Culture and Communications Organization in [[Iran]], in 1994. According to Taskhiri, dignity is a state to which all humans have equal ''potential'', but which can only be actualized by living a life pleasing to the eyes of God.&lt;ref name="HafezKenny2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hafez|first1=Kai|author2=Mary Ann Kenny|title=The Islamic world and the West: an introduction to political cultures and international relations|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11651-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with the 1990 [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], which states that "True faith is the guarantee for enhancing such [basic human] dignity along the path to human perfection".&lt;ref name="MAYER2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ann Elizabeth|title=Islam and Human Rights: Tradition and Politics|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4335-8|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity is considered as Buddhahood in Mahayana Buddhism in which it is rooted in the idea that we are able to choose the path of self-perfection as a human being.&lt;ref name="Buddhism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.org/buddhism/buddhist-concepts/buddhism-and-human-dignity.html|title=Buddhism and Human Dignity|work=sgi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights==
{{quote|
#All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with [[reason]] and [[conscience]] and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

==Medicine==
In the 20th century, dignity became an issue for physicians and medical researchers. It has been invoked in questions of the [[bioethics]] of [[human genetic engineering]], [[human cloning]], and [[end-of-life care]] (particularly in such situations as the [[Terri Schiavo case]], a controversial situation in which life support was withdrawn from a woman diagnosed in a [[persistent vegetative state]]).&lt;ref name="Bernan2008"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Irreducably Religious Character of Human Dignity|last = Gelernter | first= David | editor = Bernan|title=Human Dignity and Bioethics: Essays Commissioned by the President's Council on Bioethics|date=April 2008|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-080071-9|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bodies===
In June 1964, the [[World Medical Association]] issued the ''[[Declaration of Helsinki]]''. The Declaration says at article 11, "It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, [[integrity]], right to [[autonomy|self-determination]], [[privacy]], and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm Declaration of Helsinki by World Medical Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183350/http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] invoked dignity in its effort to govern the progress of biology and medicine. On 4 April 1997, the Council, at Oviedo, approved the ''[[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine]]''. The convention's preamble contains these statements, among others:
{{quote|Conscious of the accelerating developments in biology and medicine;

Convinced of the need to respect the human being both as an individual and as a member of the human species and recognising the importance of ensuring the dignity of the human being;

Conscious that the misuse of biology and medicine may lead to acts endangering human dignity;

Resolving to take such measures as are necessary to safeguard human dignity and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual with regard to the application of biology and medicine.}}
The Convention states, "Parties to this Convention shall protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine."

In 1998, the United Nations mentioned dignity in the ''UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights''. At Article 2, the declaration states, "Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity." At Article 24, the declaration warns that treating a person to remove a genetic defect "could be contrary to human dignity." The ''Commentary'' that accompanies the declaration says that, as a consequence of the possibility of germ-line treatment, "it is the very dignity of the human race which is at stake."

===Canada===
In 1996, the Government of Canada issued a report entitled ''New Reproductive and Genetic Technologies''. The report used "the principles of respect for human life and dignity" as its reason for recommending that various activities associated with genetic research and human reproduction be prohibited. The report said the prohibited activities were "contrary to Canadian values of equality and respect for human life and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2329538&amp;Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;File=28|title=House Government Bill - C-47, Second Reading (35-2)|work=parl.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The Ministry of Health enacted the ''Danish Council Act 1988'', which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned "reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1984, France set up the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences (CCNE) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research. In 1986, the CCNE said, "Respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or
rules to be observed by research." The CCNE said that research on human embryos must be subject to "the rule of reason" and must have regard for "undefined dignity in its practical consequences."&lt;ref name=avis008&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 8.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231959/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCNE insisted that, in research on human embryos, the ethical principles that should apply are "respecting human dignity" and respecting "the dignity of science."&lt;ref name=avis008/&gt;

===Portugal===
The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its ''Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning'' in 1997. The opinion states, "the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Sweden's ''The Genetic Integrity Act'' (2006:351), ''The Biobanks in Medical Care Act'' (2002:297), ''Health and Medical Services (Professional Activities) Act'' (1998:531), and ''The Health and Medical Services Act'' (1982:763) all express concern for "the integrity of the individual" or "human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx Swedish statutes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818061730/http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx |date=2010-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2008, [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D., the Council's Chairman, says in the Letter of Transmittal to the President of The United States, "… there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.gov|title=Home Page - Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|work=bioethics.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916023939/http://www.bioethics.gov/|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen studied dignity as a basis for international law.&lt;ref&gt;Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a "[[natural law]] approach."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural law approach, they said, depends upon "exercises of faith."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed:&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The abiding difficulty with the natural law approach is that its assumptions, intellectual procedures, and modalities of justification can be employed equally by the proponents of human dignity and the proponents of human indignity in support of diametrically opposed empirical specifications of rights . . . .}}

===Canada===
In 2004, Canada enacted the ''[[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|title=Page not Found - Page non trouvé|date=5 June 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063723/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2(b) of the Act states, "the benefits of assisted human reproductive technologies and related research for individuals, for families and for society in general can be most effectively secured by taking appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of human health, safety, dignity and rights in the use of these technologies and in related research." The Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both, if someone undertakes a proscribed activity such as the creation of a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]].

=== European Union ===

Article 1 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the inviolability of human dignity.

===France===
In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old.&lt;ref name=avis053&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 053.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231600/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France.&lt;ref name=avis053/&gt; The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after ''in vitro'' fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Cazeau, Bernard. {{fr icon}} [http://www.senat.fr/senfic/cazeau_bernard98029w.html Senat.fr] Retrieved 2009-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Human dignity is the fundamental principle of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Article 1, paragraph 1 reads: ''"Human dignity is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." ''Human dignity is thus mentioned even before the [[right to life]]. This has a significant impact on German law-making and jurisdiction in both serious and trivial items:

*Human dignity is the basis of § 131 [[StGB]], which prohibits the depiction of cruelty against humans in an approving way. § 131 has been used to confiscate [[horror movies]] and to ban [[video game]]s like ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' series.
*A decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv045187.html|title=DFR - BVerfGE 45, 187 - Lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe|work=unibe.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|German Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1977 said [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[Parole#Criminal justice|parole]] is unconstitutional as a violation of human dignity (and the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' principle). Today, a prisoner serving a life term can be granted parole on good behavior as early as 15 years after being incarcerated, provided that his release is held to constitute little danger to the public. Note that persons deemed still dangerous can be incarcerated indefinitely on a life term, if this judgment is regularly reaffirmed.
*§ 14(3) of the [[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]], which would have allowed the [[Bundeswehr]] to shoot down airliners if they are used as weapons by terrorists, was declared unconstitutional mainly on the grounds of human dignity: killing a small number of innocent people to save a large number cannot be legalized since it treats dignity as if it were a measurable and limited quantity.
*A [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisement showing human buttocks with an "[[H.I.V.]] positive" stamp was declared a violation of human dignity by some courts, but in the end found legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20030311_1bvr042602.html|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht|work=bverfg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/presse/stern/:25.03.2003-Benetton-Werbung:/505780.html Stern.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202172716/http://www.stern.de/presse/stern/%3A25.03.2003-Benetton-Werbung%3A/505780.html |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first German law legalizing [[abortion]] in 1975 was declared unconstitutional because the court held that [[embryo]]s had human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gkpn.de/singer2.htm German law about abortion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202111015/http://www.gkpn.de/singer2.htm |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new law on abortion was developed in the 1990s. This law makes all abortions ''de jure'' illegal, except if preceded by counseling (§ 219 I GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE).
*In a decision from 1981-12-15, the ''Bundesverwaltungsgericht'' declared that [[peep show]]s violated the human dignity of the performer, regardless of her feelings. The decision was later revised. Peep shows where the performer cannot see the persons who are watching her remain prohibited as a matter of dignity.

===Iran===
The need to respect human dignity has been written in the Iranian constitution law. Article 2 of the Iranian Constitution Law mentions six principles and infrastructures as basic to the governing system which in Article 1 is called the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sixth principle of this Article concerns human dignity and stipulates that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system founded on faith in ….6) Human dignity and high value and his/her freedom as well as his responsibility before God”[3]. Besides, in the prelude to the Constitution, human dignity is referred to concerning the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Salehi, Hamid Reza. Human Dignity From the Viewpoint of Iranian Law, Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2013, 135-136. DOI:10.1007/s11673-013-9437-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa]] lists ''"human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms"'' as one of the founding values of the South African state, and the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] is described as affirming the ''"democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom"''. Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly states that ''"Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected."'' In jurisprudence, the right to dignity is often seen as underlying more specific rights, such as equality, security of the person or privacy, but it has been directly applied in a number of cases relating to [[criminal punishment]], the law of [[defamation]], and the right to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta |isbn=978-0-7021-5923-7 |chapter=Chapter Ten: Human dignity |pages=272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provides in article 7 that "Human dignity must be respected and protected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a7.html Official translation] of art. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides, in art. 120, that the state must "take account of the dignity of living beings as well as the safety of human beings, animals and the environment" when legislating on the use of reproductive and genetic material;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a120.html Official translation] of art. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently the Federal Ethics Commission on Non-Human Biotechnology (ECNH) issued, in 2008, a publication entitled "The dignity of living beings with regard to plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekah.admin.ch/fileadmin/ekah-dateien/dokumentation/publikationen/e-Broschure-Wurde-Pflanze-2008.pdf|title=English language publication|website=admin.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''eSeL''' is an [[art]] platform in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Founded 1998 by Lorenz Seidler, it provides a weekly newsletter "eSeL Mehl", various mailing lists, a photo-archive and an event-database. The label "eSeL" is also serving as a nickname for the artist Lorenz Seidler (originating in the phonetic pronunciation of his initials), who also is initiating, curating and conducting various art projects. eSeL's offices are located at [[Museumsquartier]] in [[Vienna]].

==About eSeL==
The label eSeL (also serving as a nickname of founder Lorenz Seidler) represents the crossover of the roles of artist, curator, online medium and infrastructure-provider in contemporary artistic practice in the [[new media]] genres.

"Esel" means "donkey" in German. The label originates in the phonetic pronunciation of its founder's initials and soon became a standalone brand, expanding its animal analogies into a multitude of animals-participants. Qualities attributed to the eponymous animal are consciously matching with the initiative's characteristics: stubbornness (autonomy and independence), grey fur (searching for options beyond the polarity of ''right/wrong'' or ''good/bad''), long ears (overhearing insider's information), asininity (asking alleged “stupid” questions).

eSeL aims at revealing and changing conventions and coherence in the art field, putting a special focus on structural implications and representation in the media sphere.

"Kunst kommt von Kommunizieren" ("art derives from communication") is eSeL's slogan - Contributions of the term "art" are shown as a constant process of (transitory) quality agreements.

The eSeL-initiative grew from an independent online medium for of art information and event listings to an institutional carrier and [[Server (computing)|server]] for art activities in [[Vienna]], combined with focused interventions through projects, performances, and exhibitions.

Reaching a young audience beyond the art circles, eSeL's information services deliberately feature upcoming initiatives next to well-established art positions from all fields of artistic practice in Vienna (Fine Arts, performance, dance, art-in-public space, film, media art, music and civil society's artistic activities, inviting participation by new artists as well as the audience).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">An '''ethnic bioweapon''' (''biogenetic weapon'') is a type of theoretical [[bioweapon]] that aims to harm only or primarily people of specific ethnicities or [[genotype]]s.

== History ==
One of the first modern fictional discussions of ethnic weapons is in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1942 novel ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (republished as ''The Day After Tomorrow''), in which a race-specific [[radiation]] weapon is used against a so-called "[[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]]" invader{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

=== Genetic weapons ===
In 1997, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] referred to the concept of an ethnic bioweapon as a possible risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Cohen|title=Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy|date=1997-04-28|work=Sam Nunn Policy Forum, University of Georgia|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|accessdate=2006-07-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118074748/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|archivedate=2004-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 some biological weapon experts considered such a "genetic weapon" plausible, and believed the former [[Soviet Union]] had undertaken some research on the influence of various substances on human genes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plague/interviews/davis.html Interview of Dr Christopher Davis, UK Defence Intelligence Staff], ''Plague War'', [[Frontline (TV series)|Frontline]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2000 policy paper [[Rebuilding America's Defenses]], think-tank [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) described ethnic bioweapons as a potentially "politically useful tool". PNAC went on to provide substantial staffing for the Bush Jr administration.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century'' |url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |date=September 2000 |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817122719/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of a "genetic bomb" is presented in [[Vincent Sarich]]'s and [[Frank Miele]]'s book, ''[[Race: The Reality of Human Differences]]'', published in 2004. These authors view such weapons as technically feasible but not very likely to be used. (page 248 of paperback edition.)

In 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) considered bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups as a possibility, and highlighted problems that advances in science for such things as "treatment to [[Alzheimer's]] and other debilitating diseases could also be used for malign purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the official view of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] was "The potential to target a particular ethnic group with a biological agent is probably not far off. These scenarios are not the product of the ICRC's imagination but have either occurred or been identified by countless independent and governmental experts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/gas-protocol-100605.htm Preventing the use of biological and chemical weapons: 80 years on], Official Statement by Jacques Forster, vice-president of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], 10-06-2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the US government held a congressional committee, ‘Genetics and other human modification technologies: sensible international regulation or a new kind of arms race?’, during which it was discussed how “we can anticipate a world where rogue (and even not-so-rogue) states and non-state actors attempt to manipulate human genetics in ways that will horrify us”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebadgeronline.com/2018/05/ethic-bioweapons-conspiracy-reality/|title=Ethnic-bioweapons: between conspiracy and reality - The Badger|date=2018-05-08|work=The Badger|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that a specific virus that targets individuals with a specific DNA sequence is within possibility in the near future. The magazine put forward a hypothetical scenario of a virus which caused mild flu to the general population but deadly symptoms to the [[President of the United States]]. They cite advances in personalized gene therapy as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine suggested the possibility of a virus used as an ethnic bioweapon that could [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] a "genetically-related ethnic population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/15/can-there-be-war-without-soldiers-weapons-cyberwarfare/|title=Can There Be War Without Soldiers?|last=Brooks|first=Rosa|date=2016-03-15|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli "ethno-bomb" controversy ==
In November 1998, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Israel was attempting to build an "ethno-bomb" containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel planning 'ethnic' bomb as Saddam caves in|author=Uzi Mahnaimi|author2=Marie Colvin|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date=1998-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired News]]'' also reported the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel's Ethnic Weapon? |publisher=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,16272,00.html |date=1998-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9904,ridgeway,3697,6.html |title=Ethnic Warfare |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |author=James Ridgeway |date=1999-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''[[Foreign Reports|Foreign Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9811&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;D=0&amp;P=28059 |title=UPI report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jeff|title=Debunking the “ethno-bomb”|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/02/news_154/|website=Salon|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'', describing the claims as "[[blood libel]]", reported that the likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic [[Doron Stanitsky]]. Stanitsky had sent his completely fictional work about such a weapon to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as "wholly fantastical", with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now Playing: A Blood Libel For The 21st Century|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=1998-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/talk.politics.mideast/QJKAhCi8UY0/uTqlQUSv8goJ|title=Google Groups quoting Haaretz|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and no sources were ever identified. Neither of the authors of the ''Sunday Times'' story, [[Uzi Mahnaimi]] and [[Marie Colvin]], have spoken publicly on the matter{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

==Russian ban on export of biological samples==
In May 2007, a Russian newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]'' reported that the Russian government banned all exports of human biosamples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=769777|title=Россия блюдет человеческий образец
|date=2007-05-29|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=[[Kommersant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report claims that the reason for the ban was a secret [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] report about on-going development of "genetic bioweapons" targeting Russian population by Western institutions. The report mentions the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], American International Health Alliance, Department of Medical Biotechnology of Jagiellonian University, [[United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division]], Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology Warsaw University, and [[United States Agency for International Development]].

== Freud ==
In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' (1905), Freud distinguished the fixations of the libido on an incestuous object from a fixation upon a specific, partial ''aim'', such as [[voyeurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70 and p.&amp;nbsp;151&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud theorized that some humans may develop psychological fixation due to one or more of the following:
#A lack of proper gratification during one of the [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages of development]].
#Receiving a strong impression from one of these stages, in which case the person's personality would reflect that stage throughout adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
#"An excessively strong manifestation of these instincts at a very early age [which] leads to a kind of partial ''fixation'', which then constitutes a weak point in the structure of the sexual function".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1995) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freud's thought developed, so did the range of possible 'fixation points' he saw as significant in producing particular neuroses.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Penguin Freud Library 10) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued to view fixation as "the manifestation of very early linkages – linkages which it is hard to resolve – between instincts and impressions and the objects involved in those impressions".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'' pp. 137–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalytic [[therapy]] involved producing a new [[transference]] fixation in place of the old one.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (Harvard 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The new fixation – for example a father-transference onto the analyst – may be very different from the old, but will absorb its energies and enable them eventually to be released for non-fixated purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections===
*Whether a particularly obsessive attachment is a fixation or a defensible expression of [[love]] is at times debatable. Fixation to intangibles (i.e., ideas, ideologies, etc.) can also occur. The obsessive factor of fixation is also found in symptoms pertaining to [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], which psychoanalysts linked to a mix of early (pregenital) frustrations and gratifications.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fixation has been compared to [[Imprinting (psychology)|psychological imprinting]]&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; at an early and sensitive period of development.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Gregory ed, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; others object that Freud was attempting to stress the looseness of the ties between libido and object, and the need to find a specific cause any given (perverse or neurotic) fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Mitchell, ''Relational Concepts in Psychoanalysis'' (1988) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Freudians ==
[[Melanie Klein]] saw fixation as inherently pathological&lt;ref&gt;C. Geissmann-Chambon/P. Geissmann, ''A History of Child Psychoanalysis'' (Routledge 1998) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; – a blocking of potential [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] by way of [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyndsey Stonebridge/John Phillips, ''Reading Melanie Klein'' (1998) p. 243n&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] distinguished fixation to zone – oral or anal, for example – from fixation to mode, such as taking in, as with his instance of the man who "may eagerly absorb the 'milk of wisdom' where he once desired more tangible fluids from more sensuous containers".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 72 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Berne]], developed his insight further as part of [[transactional analysis]], suggesting that "particular games and scripts, and their accompanying physical symptoms, are based in appropriate zones and modes".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (Corgi 1975) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] saw the [[Grandiosity|grandiose self]] as a fixation upon a normal childhood stage;&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[post-Freudian]]s explored the role of fixation in aggression and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Brunas-Wagstaff, ''Personality: A Cognitive Approach'' (1998) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Coleridge's ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' has been seen as using witchcraft as a vehicle to explore psychological fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Samuel Taylor Coleridge'' (2010) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tennyson]] has been considered to show a [[Romanticism|romantic]] fixation on days of old.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Ledbetter, ''Tennyson and Victorian Periodicals'' (2007) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Fusion of horizons'''" ({{lang-de|Horizontverschmelzung}}) is a [[dialectic]]al concept which results from the rejection of two alternatives: [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]], whereby the objectification of the other is premised on the forgetting of oneself; and [[absolute knowledge]], according to which [[universal history]] can be articulated within a single horizon. Therefore, it argues that we exist neither in closed horizons, nor within a horizon that is unique.

People come from different backgrounds and it is not possible to totally remove oneself from one's background, history, culture, gender, language, education, etc. to an entirely different system of attitudes, beliefs and ways of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gadamer/#HapTra Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Hans-George Gadamer, Sect. 3.2: The Happening of Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt; People may be looking for a way to be engaged in understanding a conversation or dialogue about different cultures and the speaker interprets texts or stories based on his or her past experience and prejudice. Therefore, “[[hermeneutic]] reflection and determination of one’s own present life interpretation calls for the unfolding of one’s ‘effective-historical’ consciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;Herda (1999:63)&lt;/ref&gt; During the discourse, a fusion of “horizons” takes place between the speaker and listeners.

==Horizons to be fused==
[[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]]&lt;ref&gt;1988:269&lt;/ref&gt; defines horizon: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every finite present has its limitations. We define the concept of “situation” by saying that it represents a standpoint that limits the possibility of vision. Hence essential part of the concept of situation is the concept of “''horizon''.” The horizon is the range of vision that includes everything that can be seen from a particular vantage point... A person who has no horizon is a man who does not see far enough and hence overvalues what is nearest to him. On the other hand, "to have an horizon" means not being limited to what is nearby, but to being able to see beyond it...[W]orking out of the hermeneutical situation means the achievement of the right horizon of inquiry for the questions evoked by the encounter with tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Gadamer, Hans-Georg. ''Truth and Method.'' New York: Continuum, 1997, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gao was the Chair of the Department of Art History and Professor for Distinguished Service at [[Sichuan Fine Arts Institute|Sichuan Fine Art Institute, China]]. His works focus on the influence and nature of Chinese art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/minglu-gao|title=Minglu Gao|website=MIT Press|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=avant&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/gao-minglu-illuminating-avant-garde|title=Gao Minglu: Illuminating the Avant-Garde – Pitt Chronicle – University of Pittsburgh|first=University of Pittsburgh University|last=Webteam|website=www.chronicle.pitt.edu|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Minglu was born in [[Tianjin, China]] in October 1949.&lt;ref name="mingluweb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/高名潞|title=Gao Minglu|date=2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The Lonely Horizon”， Wei，Sheng。 Chongqing Chubanshe Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/minglu-gao|title=Minglu Gao|website=MIT Press|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his exhibitions in China was shut down by the Chinese government in 1989 after only a few hours.&lt;ref name="avant2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/gao-minglu-illuminating-avant-garde|title=Gao Minglu: Illuminating the Avant-Garde - Pitt Chronicle - University of Pittsburgh|last=Webteam|first=University of Pittsburgh University|website=www.chronicle.pitt.edu|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, 

Minglu graduated from the [[China National Academy of Art]]. In the same year he worked as an editor of one of China’s art magazines.&lt;ref name=avant/&gt; Minglu serves as professor, artist, [[curator]] and [[art critic]].&lt;ref name=avant/&gt;&lt;ref name = pittbio/&gt;  During the [[cultural revolution]] "[[Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement]]" he traveled to [[Inner Mongolia]] and worked as a herdsman for five years.&lt;ref name=mingluweb/&gt; After the Cultural Revolution, he attended the [[Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts]] to study [[art history]]. In 1982 he attended the Graduate School of Chinese Art Research Institute where he received his master's degree. From 1984–1989 he was the editor of "Art" magazine. While there, he regularly wrote about Chinese Art news.&lt;ref name = mingluweb&gt;{{cite web| url = https://baike.baidu.com/item/高名潞 | accessdate = 31 July 2017 | title = Gao Minglu | date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to study [[Marxism–Leninism]] in China from 1989–1991.&lt;ref name=mingluweb/&gt;

He planned a Chinese avant-garde art exhibition entitled "Inside Out: New Chinese from 1995 to 1998. During the same time He was showing his work in the "Global Concept Art Exhibition from 1950s to 1980s".  He also participated in the exhibition of the "Global&amp;nbsp;Concept Art&amp;nbsp;Exhibition from 1950s to 1980s",  In 1999 he showed his work in the "Five Continents and a City" exhibition in Mexico in and was one of the curators from China. During this same time, Minglu wrote an English&amp;nbsp;monograph&amp;nbsp;describing the exhibitions. He wrote other papers on Chinese art.&lt;ref name = mingluweb/&gt;

Gao was awarded the American Academy of Sciences "American Academic Exchange Committee" postdoctoral project scholarship in 1991. This allowed him to come to the US to research and study at Ohio University and&amp;nbsp;Harvard University. He received his doctorate in the&amp;nbsp;history of art research. He graduated from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name = mingluweb/&gt;

==Exhibitions==

During this same time his criticism research and criticism perspectives focused on the present and contemporary art of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. These studies included comparative research on modernism and avant-garde in China and the West.&lt;ref name = mingluweb/&gt; His work has been shown in a number of shows and exhibitions that include:

In mathematics, a '''genus-two surface''' (also known as a '''double torus''' or '''two-holed torus''') is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] formed by the [[connected sum]] of two [[torus|tori]]. That is to say, from each of two tori the interior of a disk is removed, and the boundaries of the two disks are identified (glued together), forming a double torus. 

This is the simplest case of the connected sum of ''n'' tori.  A connected sum of tori is an example of a [[two-dimensional]] [[manifold]]. According to the [[Surface (topology)|classification theorem]] for 2-manifolds, every [[compact space|compact]] [[connected space|connected]] 2-manifold is either a sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of [[real projective plane]]s.

[[Double torus knot]]s are studied in [[knot theory]].

==Example==
The [[Bolza surface]] is the most symmetric [[Riemann surface]] of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]&amp;nbsp;2.

In [[mathematics]], '''geometry and topology''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the historically distinct disciplines of [[geometry]] and [[topology]], as general frameworks allow both disciplines to be manipulated uniformly, most visibly in [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|local to global theorems]] in Riemannian geometry, and results like the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] and [[Chern–Weil theory]].

Sharp distinctions between geometry and topology can be drawn, however, as discussed below.{{clarify|how recognized are these sharp distinctions? Are they official in the sense of professional organizations or some such, or is it up to the practitioners?|date=December 2016}}

It is also the title of a journal ''[[Geometry &amp; Topology]]'' that covers these topics.

==Scope==
It is distinct from "geometric topology", which more narrowly involves applications of topology to geometry.

It includes:
* [[Differential geometry and topology]]
* [[Geometric topology]] (including [[low-dimensional topology]] and [[surgery theory]])

It does not include such parts of [[algebraic topology]] as [[homotopy theory]], but some areas of geometry and topology (such as surgery theory, particularly [[algebraic surgery theory]]) are heavily algebraic.

==Distinction between geometry and topology==
Geometry has ''local'' structure (or infinitesimal), while topology only has ''global'' structure. Alternatively, geometry has ''continuous'' [[moduli space|moduli]], while topology has ''discrete'' moduli.

By examples, an example of geometry is [[Riemannian geometry]], while an example of topology is [[homotopy theory]]. The study of [[metric space]]s is geometry, the study of [[topological space]]s is topology.

The terms are not used completely consistently: [[symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and [[Coarse structure|coarse geometry]] is global, not local.

===Local versus global structure===
By definition, [[differentiable manifold]]s of a fixed dimension are all locally diffeomorphic to [[Euclidean space]], so aside from dimension, there are no local invariants. Thus, differentiable structures on a manifold are topological in nature.

By contrast, the [[Curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a local (indeed, infinitesimal) invariant{{clarify|not clear why curvature would be invariant|date=December 2016}} (and is the only local invariant under [[isometry]]).

===Moduli===
If a structure has a discrete moduli (if it has no [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s, or if a deformation of a structure is isomorphic to the original structure), the structure is said to be '''rigid''', and its study (if it is a geometric or topological structure) is topology. If it has non-trivial deformations, the structure is said to be '''flexible''', and its study is geometry.

The space of [[homotopy]] classes of maps is discrete,{{efn|Given point-set conditions, which are satisfied for manifolds; more generally homotopy classes form a [[totally disconnected]] but not necessarily discrete space; for example, the [[fundamental group]] of the [[Hawaiian earring]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Specific claim about a topological space.}}}} so studying maps up to homotopy is topology.
Similarly, differentiable structures on a manifold is usually a discrete space, and hence an example of topology, but [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;s]] have continuous moduli of differentiable structures.

[[Algebraic varieties]] have continuous [[moduli space]]s, hence their study is [[algebraic geometry]]. These are finite-dimensional moduli spaces.

The space of Riemannian metrics on a given differentiable manifold is an infinite-dimensional space.

===Symplectic manifolds===
[[Symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and parts of their study are called [[symplectic topology]] and [[symplectic geometry]].

By [[Darboux's theorem]], a symplectic manifold has no local structure, which suggests that their study be called topology.

By contrast, the space of symplectic structures on a manifold form a continuous moduli, which suggests that their study be called geometry.

However, up to [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]], the space of symplectic structures is discrete (any family of symplectic structures are isotopic).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.duke.edu/~bryant/ParkCityLectures.pdf Introduction to Lie Groups and Symplectic Geometry], by [[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Robert Bryant]], p. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hieratic''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|æ|t|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-grc|ἱερατικά|hieratiká|priestly}}) is a [[cursive]] writing system used for [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], and the principal script used to write that language from its development in the 3rd millennium BCE until the rise of [[Demotic script|Demotic]] in the mid 1st millennium BCE. It was primarily written in ink with a reed pen on [[papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=William B.|title=Linguistics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-twBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-48339-3|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the second century, the term ''hieratic'' was first used by [[Clement of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Goedicke 1988:vii; Wente 2001:2006. The reference is made in Clement's ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book5.html Stromata]'' 5:4.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the Greek for "priestly writing" ({{lang-grc-koi|γράμματα ἱερατικά}}), as at that time, hieratic was used only for religious texts and literature, as had been the case for the previous eight and a half centuries.

''Hieratic'' can also be an [[adjective]] meaning "[o]f or associated with sacred persons or offices; [[wikt:sacerdotal|sacerdotal]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hieratic Definition of hieratic], Free Online Dictionary. Retrieved 2011-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Hieratic developed as a cursive form of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic script]] in the [[Naqada III]] period, roughly 3200–3000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Hoffmann (2012), '' Hieratic And Demotic Literature'', OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[manuscript hieroglyphs|handwritten printed hieroglyphs]] continued to be used in some formal situations, such as manuscripts of the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]], noncursive hieroglyphic script became largely restricted to monumental inscriptions. 

Hieratic was used into the [[Hellenistic period]]. Around 660 BCE, the even more-cursive [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic script]] arose in northern Egypt and replaced hieratic and the southern shorthand known as [[abnormal hieratic]] for most mundane writing, such as personal letters and mercantile documents. Hieratic continued to be used by the [[priest]]ly class for religious texts and literature into the third century BCE.

==Uses and materials==
[[File:Heratic script limestone.jpg|right|thumb|One of four official letters to [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Khay copied onto fragments of limestone (an [[ostracon]]).]]
Through most of its long history, hieratic was used for writing administrative documents, accounts, legal texts, and letters, as well as mathematical, medical, literary, and religious texts. During the Græco-Roman period, when Demotic (and later [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]) had become the chief administrative script, hieratic was limited primarily to religious texts. In general, hieratic was much more important than hieroglyphs throughout Egypt's history, being the script used in daily life. It was also the writing system first taught to students, knowledge of hieroglyphs being limited to a small minority who were given additional training.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1983:583.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is often possible to detect errors in hieroglyphic texts that came about due to a misunderstanding of an original hieratic text.

Most often, hieratic script was written in [[ink]] with a [[Phragmites|reed]] [[brush]]&lt;ref&gt;During the Roman period reed [[pen]]s (''calami'') were also used.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[papyrus]], [[wood]], [[stone]] or [[pottery]] [[ostracon|ostraca]]. Thousands of limestone ostraca have been found at the site of [[Deir al-Madinah]], revealing an intimate picture of the lives of common Egyptian workmen. Besides papyrus, stone, ceramic shards, and wood, there are hieratic texts on leather rolls, though few have survived. There are also hieratic texts written on cloth, especially on linen used in [[Mummy|mummification]]. There are some hieratic texts inscribed on stone, a variety known as lapidary hieratic; these are particularly common on [[stela]]e from the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]].

During the late [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th Dynasty]], hieratic was sometimes incised into mud tablets with a [[stylus]], similar to [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]. About five hundred of these tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat),&lt;ref&gt;Soukiassian, Wuttman, Pantalacci 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and a single example was discovered from the site of Ayn al-Gazzarin, both in the [[Dakhla Oasis]].&lt;ref&gt;Posener-Kriéger 1992; Pantalacci 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20120514 Scribes and craftsmen: the noble art of writing on clay.] Feb 29, 2012; UCL Institute of Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of [[papyrus]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson and Quirke 1995:20.&lt;/ref&gt; These tablets record inventories, name lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters. Of the letters, many are internal letters that were circulated within the palace and the local settlement, but others were sent from other villages in the oasis to the governor.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Scribe's exercise tablet 1.jpg|right|thumb|Exercise tablet with hieratic excerpt from ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat|The Instructions of Amenemhat]]''.  [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XVIII]], reign of [[Amenhotep I]], {{nowrap|{{circa|1514}}–1493 BC.}}  Text reads: "Be on your guard against all who are subordinate to you ... Trust no brother, know no friend, make no intimates."]]
Hieratic script, unlike inscriptional and [[manuscript hieroglyphs]], reads from right to left. Initially, hieratic could be written in either columns or horizontal lines, but after the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] (specifically during the reign of [[Amenemhat III]]), horizontal writing became the standard.

Hieratic is noted for its cursive nature and use of [[Ligature (palaeography)|ligatures]] for a number of characters. Hieratic script also uses a much more standardized [[orthography]] than hieroglyphs; texts written in the latter often had to take into account extra-textual concerns, such as decorative uses and religious concerns that were not present in, say, a tax receipt. There are also some signs that are unique to hieratic, though [[Egyptologist]]s have invented equivalent hieroglyphic forms for hieroglyphic transcriptions and typesetting.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Several hieratic characters have diacritical additions so that similar signs could easily be distinguished. 

Hieratic is often present in any given period in two forms, a highly ligatured, cursive script used for administrative documents, and a broad [[uncial]] [[bookhand]] used for literary, scientific, and religious texts. These two forms can often be significantly different from one another. Letters, in particular, used very cursive forms for quick writing, often with large numbers of abbreviations for formulaic phrases, similar to [[shorthand]].

A highly cursive form of hieratic known as "Abnormal Hieratic" was used in the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] area from the second half of the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] until the beginning of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Wente 2001:210. See also Malinine [1974].&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the script of Upper Egyptian administrative documents and was used primarily for legal texts, land leases, letters, and other texts. This type of writing was superseded by Demotic—a Lower Egyptian scribal tradition—during the 26th Dynasty, when Demotic was established as a standard administrative script throughout a re-unified Egypt.

==Influence==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Hieratic has had influence on a number of other writing systems. The most obvious is that on [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], its direct descendant. Related to this are the Demotic signs of the [[Meroitic script]] and the borrowed Demotic characters used in the [[Coptic alphabet]] and [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]].

Outside of the Nile Valley, many of the signs used in the [[Byblos syllabary]] were apparently borrowed from [[Old Kingdom]] hieratic signs.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that early [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] used [[Egyptian numerals|hieratic numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;Aharoni 1966; Goldwasser 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode==

The Unicode standard considers hieratic characters' font variants of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the two scripts have been unified.&lt;ref name="Unicode"&gt;The [[Unicode]] Standard, Version 5.2.0, Chapter 14.17, ''Egyptian Hieroglyphs'' [https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Hieroglyphs themselves were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2. To date, there is no known Unicode font with hieratic.

'''Holocaust denial''' is the act of denying the [[genocide]] of [[Jews]] in [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].{{R|definition}} Holocaust denial claims include: that [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Final Solution]] was aimed only at [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews|deporting Jews]] from the Reich and did not include their extermination; that Nazi authorities did not use [[extermination camp]]s and [[gas chamber]]s to [[mass murder]] Jews; or that the actual number of Jews killed was significantly lower than the historically accepted figure of 5 to 6 million, typically around a tenth of that figure.{{R|often claims|Key elements|Assertions}} Because Holocaust denial is a common facet of certain racist propaganda, it is considered a serious societal problem in many places where it occurs and is [[Laws against Holocaust denial|illegal in several European countries and Israel]]. Holocaust denial is sponsored by some Middle Eastern governments, including Iran and Syria.

In some post-Soviet states, Holocaust deniers do not deny the very fact of mass murder of Jews, but they deny some national or regional elements of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/13501674.2012.730732 |quote=In general, post-Soviet Holocaust denial has differed from Holocaust denial in the style of David Irving or Ernst Zündel. In post-Soviet space, the Holocaust has not usually been denied as such and post-Soviet radical right activists did not question the existence of gas chambers in Auschwitz, or the anti-Jewish politics of Nazi Germany. Instead, nationalist post-Soviet discourses denied some of the national or regional elements of the Holocaust, like, for example, the contribution of different nationalist organizations or armies to it, or very frequently the participation of local populations in pogroms and other forms of anti-Jewish violence.|title=Debating, obfuscating and disciplining the Holocaust: Post-Soviet historical discourses on the OUN–UPA and other nationalist movements|journal=East European Jewish Affairs|volume=42|issue=3|pages=199–241|year=2012|last1=Rossoliński-Liebe|first1=Grzegorz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars use the term ''[[Denialism|denial]]'' to describe the views and methodology of Holocaust deniers in order to distinguish them from legitimate [[historical revisionism|historical revisionists]], who challenge orthodox interpretations of history using established historical [[methodology|methodologies]].{{R|terminology}} Holocaust deniers generally do not accept ''denial'' as an appropriate description of their activities and use the euphemism ''[[Historical negationism|revisionism]]'' instead.{{R|Revisionist}} The methodologies of Holocaust deniers are often based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary.{{R|predetermined}}

Most Holocaust deniers claim, either explicitly or implicitly, that the Holocaust is a hoax—or at best an exaggeration—arising from a deliberate [[Jewish conspiracy]] designed to advance the interest of Jews at the expense of other people.{{R|hoax}} For this reason, Holocaust denial is generally considered to be an [[antisemitic]]{{R|antisemitic}} [[conspiracy theory]].{{R|conspiracy}}

== Terminology and etymology==
Holocaust deniers prefer to refer to their work as historical revisionism, and object to being referred to as "[[Denialism|deniers]]".{{R|Revisionist}} [[Emory University]] professor [[Deborah Lipstadt]] has written that: "The deniers' selection of the name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in the traditional practice of illuminating the past."&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]] (1993) ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'' New York: [[Penguin Books]] p.25. {{ISBN|0-452-27274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars consider this misleading since the methods of Holocaust denial differ from those of legitimate historical revision.&lt;ref&gt;"The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians Deborah Lipstadt (1993) and Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a 'certain body of irrefutable evidence' or a 'convergence of evidence' that suggest that an event—like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust—did, in fact, occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence...."&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimate historical revisionism is explained in a resolution adopted by the [[Duke University]] History Department, November 8, 1991, and reprinted in ''Duke Chronicle'', November 13, 1991 in response to an advertisement produced by Bradley R Smith's [[CODOH|Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denying the Holocaust: the growing assault on truth and memory|edition=reprint |author=Lipstadt, Deborah E. |year=1994 |publisher=Plume |isbn=978-0-452-27274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That historians are constantly engaged in historical revision is certainly correct; however, what historians do is very different from this advertisement. Historical revision of major events ... is not concerned with the actuality of these events; rather, it concerns their historical interpretation – their causes and consequences generally.}}

Lipstadt writes that modern Holocaust denial draws its inspiration from various sources, including a school of thought which used an established method to question government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah E. Lipstadt|title=Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yLm_cHp_REC|date=18 December 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-2748-6|quote=Modern Holocaust denial draws inspiration from a variety of sources. Among them is a legitimate historical tradition that was highly critical of government policies and believed that history was being used to justify these policies. The deniers consider themselves heirs of a group of influential American historians who were deeply disturbed by American involvement in World War I. These respected scholars, who called themselves revisionists, would have been appalled to learn of the purposes to which their arguments were put.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Donald L. Niewyk gave some examples of how legitimate historical revisionism—the re-examination of accepted history and its updating with newly discovered, more accurate, or less-biased information—may be applied to the study of the Holocaust as new facts emerge to change the historical understanding of it:

{{quote|With the main features of the Holocaust clearly visible to all but the willfully blind, historians have turned their attention to aspects of the story for which the evidence is incomplete or ambiguous. These are not minor matters by any means, but turn on such issues as Hitler's role in the event, Jewish responses to persecution, and reactions by onlookers both inside and outside Nazi-controlled Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Niewyk |editor-first=Donald L. |title=The Holocaust: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation |publisher=D. C. Heath and Company |date=1992 |page=7 |chapter=1: Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GbcWAQAAIAAJ|isbn=9780618214624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, the Holocaust denial movement bases its approach on the predetermined idea that the Holocaust, as understood by mainstream historiography, did not occur.{{R|predetermined}} Sometimes referred to as "[[Historical negationism|negationism]]", from the French term ''négationnisme'' introduced by [[Henry Rousso]],&lt;ref&gt;See Alain Finkielkraut, Mary Byrd Kelly, Richard J. Golsan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmB1PW7ySPQC&amp;pg=PA125 ''The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide'']. University of Nebraska Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust deniers attempt to rewrite history by minimizing, denying or simply ignoring essential facts. [[Koenraad Elst]] writes:

{{quote|Negationism means the denial of historical crimes against humanity. It is not a reinterpretation of known facts, but the denial of known facts. The term negationism has gained currency as the name of a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941–45, also known as the Holocaust (Greek: complete burning) or the ''Shoah'' (Hebrew: disaster). Negationism is mostly identified with the effort at re-writing history in such a way that the fact of the Holocaust is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Koenraad Elst]].

While the [[Second World War]] was still underway, the Nazis had already formed a contingency plan that in case of defeat they would carry out the total destruction of German records.&lt;ref name="klars-coth"&gt;{{cite web |url={{google books|id=NTjJDNi7fq4C |title=French Children of the Holocaust: A Memorial |page= |plainurl=yes}} |last1=Klarsfeld |first1=Serge |title=French Children of the Holocaust: A Memorial |author-link1=Serge Klarsfeld |date=1996 |location=New York |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |lccn=96031206 |isbn=9780814726624 |oclc=35029709 }}p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have documented evidence that as Germany's defeat became imminent and Nazi leaders realized they would most likely be captured and brought to trial, great effort was made to destroy all evidence of mass extermination. [[Heinrich Himmler]] instructed his camp commandants to destroy records, crematoria, and other signs of mass extermination.&lt;ref name = Arad_1984&gt;

====French collaboration in archive destruction====

In [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupied France]], the situation with respect to preserving war records was not much better, partly as a result of French state secrecy rules dating back to well before the war aimed at protecting the French government and the state from embarrassing revelations, and partly to avoid culpability.   For example, at [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], the [[Prefecture of Police]] destroyed nearly all of the massive archive of Jewish arrest and deportation.{{R|klars-coth}}

===Efforts to preserve the historical record===

====During the war====

One of the earliest efforts to save historical record of the Holocaust occurred during the war, in France, where [[Drancy internment camp]] records were carefully preserved and turned over to the new {{Interlanguage link multi|French Bureau of Veterans and War Victims|fr|3=ONAC|vertical-align=sup}}; however, the bureau then held them in secret, refusing to release copies later, even to the [[Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation]] (CDJC).&lt;!-- {{R|klars-coth}} --&gt;

In 1943, [[Isaac Schneersohn]], anticipating the need for a center to document and preserve the memory of the persecution for historical reasons and also support claims post-war, gathered together 40 representatives from Jewish organizations in [[Grenoble]] which was under Italian occupation at the time&lt;ref name="mdlShoah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorialdelashoah.org/index.php/en/archives-and-documentation/the-cdjc-catalogue/the-history-of-the-center-of-contemporary-jewish-documentation-cdjc |title=The History of the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation (CDJC) |last1= |first1= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316150400/http://www.memorialdelashoah.org/index.php/en/archives-and-documentation/the-cdjc-catalogue/the-history-of-the-center-of-contemporary-jewish-documentation-cdjc |archivedate=March 16, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to form a ''centre de documentation''.&lt;ref name="Jockusch"&gt;{{cite web |url={{google books|id=E2IhaiQwJQ8C|page=18|title=Collect and Record!

====Immediate post-war period====

In 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize the documentation of [[Nazi crimes]] as propaganda and took steps against it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hobbs|first1=Joseph Patrick| last2=Eisenhower |first2=Dwight D. | last3=Marshall |first3=George Catlett |title=Dear General: Eisenhower's Wartime Letters to Marshall|date=12 May 1999|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801862191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The same day&lt;ref&gt;April 12, 1945,&lt;/ref&gt; I saw my first horror camp. It was near the town of [[Gotha]]. I have never been able to describe my emotional reactions when I first came face to face with indisputable evidence of Nazi brutality and ruthless disregard of every shred of decency. Up to that time I had known about it only generally or through secondary sources. I am certain, however, that I have never at any time experienced an equal sense of shock.&lt;br/&gt;
I visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that "the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda". Some members of the visiting party were unable to go through with the ordeal. I not only did so but as soon as I returned to [[George S. Patton|Patton]]'s headquarters that evening I sent communications to both Washington and London, urging the two governments to send instantly to Germany a random group of newspaper editors and representative groups from the national legislatures. I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and the British public in a fashion that would leave no room for cynical doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower, Dwight D.]], ''Crusade in Europe'', pp. 409–10, Doubleday, New York, 1948 (no ISBN for this edition)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eisenhower, upon finding the victims of the death camps, ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the dead. He wrote the following to General [[George Marshall]] after visiting a German internment camp near Gotha, Germany:

{{quote|The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they [there] were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to "propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Hobbs|first1=Joseph Patrick| last2=Eisenhower |first2=Dwight D. | last3=Marshall |first3=George Catlett |title=Dear General: Eisenhower's Wartime Letters to Marshall|date=12 May 1999|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801862191| page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nuremberg trials====

The [[Nuremberg trials]] took place in Germany after the war in 1945–1946. The stated aim was to dispense justice in retribution for atrocities of the German government.  This Allied intention to administer justice post-war was first announced in 1943 in the [[Moscow Declaration|Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe]] and reiterated at the [[Yalta Conference]] and at Berlin in 1945.&lt;ref name=Wright-1946&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wright |first= Quincy |authorlink= Quincy Wright |year= 1946 |title= The Nuremberg Trial |journal= [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume= 246 |pages= 72–80 |jstor= 1025134 |doi=10.1177/000271624624600113 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the intention was not specifically to preserve the historical record of the Holocaust, some of the core documents required to prosecute the cases were provided to them by the [[CDJC]], and much of the huge trove of archives were then transferred to the CDJC after the trials and became the core of future Holocaust historiography.&lt;ref name="Bensoussan"&gt;{{cite web |url={{google books|id=aNzjTUT6jdYC|title=Holocaust Historiography in Context: Emergence, Challenges, Polemics and Achievements |plainurl=yes |page=245}} |title=Holocaust Historiography in Context: Emergence, Challenges, Polemics and Achievements |editor1=David Bankier |editor2=Dan Mikhman &lt;!--|chapter=Jewish Contemporary Documentation Centre (CDJC) and Holocaust Research in France, 1945-1970--&gt; |last1=Bensoussan |first1=Georges |date=2008 |website= |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |pages=245–254 |isbn=9789653083264  |accessdate=2015-03-15 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuremberg trials were important historically, but the events were still very recent, television was in its infancy and not present, and there was a little public impact.  There were isolated moments of limited public awareness from Hollywood films such as ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959) or the 1961 ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' which had some newsreel footage of actual scenes from liberated Nazi concentration camps including scenes of piles of naked corpses laid out in rows and bulldozed into large pits, which was considered exceptionally graphic for the time.
Public awareness changed when the Eichmann trial riveted the world's attention fifteen years after Nuremberg.&lt;ref name="yadvashem-impact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/eichmann/awareness_of_the_holocaust.asp |title=Shaping an Awareness of the Holocaust in Israeli and World Public Opinion |last1= |first1= |date=2015 |website=yadvashem.org |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023150544/http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/eichmann/awareness_of_the_holocaust.asp |archivedate=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2015-06-26 |quote=In the annals of public awareness of the Holocaust period, nothing rivals the Eichmann trial as a milestone and turning point, whose impact is evident to this day. The trial introduced the Holocaust into the historical, educational, legal and cultural discourse, not merely in Israel and the Jewish world, but on the consciousness of all peoples of the world. Sixteen years after the end of the Holocaust, it focused attention upon the account of the suffering and torment of the Jewish people, as recounted to the judges. Its powerful, and one could claim, revolutionary, consequences continue right up to the present day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shandler-1999a"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shandler |first=Jeffrey |title=While America Watches : Televising the Holocaust |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NobvLCXFIOcC&amp;pg=PA127 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |date=4 February 1999 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-518258-3 |page=127 |chapter=4. The Man in the Glass Box |quote=The Eichmann case is widely cited as a[sic] marking a threshold in American awareness of the Holocaust, generating a 'renewed engagement' and 'heightened historical consciousness' as well as serving as a catalyst for a spate of American Holocaust literature, television programs, and feature films.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trial of Adolf Eichmann====

In 1961, the Israeli government captured [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Argentina and brought him to Israel to stand trial for war crimes.
Chief prosecutor [[Gideon Hausner]]'s intentions were not only to demonstrate Eichmann's guilt personally but to present material about the entire Holocaust, thus producing a comprehensive record.&lt;ref name=Cesarani-2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Cesarani |first=David |authorlink=David Cesarani |title=Eichmann: His Life and Crimes |publisher=[[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |location=London |year=2005 |origyear=2004 |isbn = 978-0-09-944844-0 |pages=252, 254–5, 325–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli government arranged for the trial to have prominent media coverage.&lt;ref name=Birn-2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birn |first=Ruth Bettina |title=Fifty Years After: A Critical Look at the Eichmann Trial |journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law |year=2011 |volume=44 |pages=443–473 |url=http://law.case.edu/journals/JIL/Documents/(21)%20Birn_Darby.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021540/http://law.case.edu/journals/JIL/Documents/%2821%29%20Birn_Darby.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=2015-04-02 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many major newspapers from all over the globe sent reporters and published front-page coverage of the story.{{R|Cesarani-2005}}
Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings, and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day.{{R|Cesarani-2005}}&lt;ref name=Shandler-1999b&gt;{{cite book |last=Shandler |first=Jeffrey |title=While America Watches: Televising the Holocaust |year=1999 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-511935-5 |page=93 |quote= The trial and the surrounding media coverage sparked renewed interest in wartime events, and the resulting increase in publication of memoirs and scholarly works helped raise public awareness of the Holocaust.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-World War II history==
{{Category see also |Holocaust deniers}}

In the immediate aftermath of the war, prior to the extensive documentation efforts by the allied forces, a sense of disbelief caused many to deny the initial reports of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="FoguKansteiner2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claudio Fogu|author2=Wulf Kansteiner|author3=Todd Presner|title=Probing the Ethics of Holocaust Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRADQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=17 October 2016|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-97051-9|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2017}} Compounding this disbelief was the memory of [[Fake news|forged newspaper accounts]] of the [[German Corpse Factory]], an anti-German [[atrocity propaganda]] campaign during WWI, which was widely known to be false by 1945.&lt;ref name="BBC fake news"&gt;{{cite news|title=The corpse factory and the birth of fake news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38995205|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=BBC News|date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, the Nazi government used this propaganda against the British, claiming allegations of concentration camps were malicious lies put forward by the British government, and historians Joachim Neander and [[Randal Marlin]] note that this story "encouraged later disbelief when early reports circulated about the Holocaust under Hitler".{{R|BBC fake news}} [[Victor Cavendish-Bentinck]], chairman of the British Joint Intelligence Committee, noted that these reports were similar to "stories of employment of human corpses during the last war for the manufacture of fat which was a grotesque lie"; likewise, ''[[The Christian Century]]'' commented that "The parallel between this story and the 'corpse factory' atrocity tale of the First World War is too striking to be overlooked."&lt;ref name = bgd&gt;Neander, Joachim, ''The German Corpse Factory. The Master Hoax of British Propaganda in the First World War'', Saarland University Press, 2013, pp.8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Neander notes that "There can be no doubt that the reported commercial use of the corpses of the murdered Jews undermined the credibility of the news coming from Poland and delayed action that might have rescued many Jewish lives."&lt;ref name = bgd/&gt;

The [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] movement has been revitalized by Holocaust denial. Small but vocal numbers of Neo-Nazis realized that recreation of a Hitlerite-style regime may be impossible, but a replica might be produced in the future and realized that to rehabilitate Nazism required the discrediting of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen E. Atkins|title=Holocaust Denial as an International Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Uj6u6b-ZIC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34538-8|quote=Holocaust denial has played an important role in the revitalization of the Neo-Nazi movement. There was a smaller but nonetheless vocal number of supporters in other Western European countries and the United States. These neo-Nazis realized that a Hitlerite regime was impossible, but a reasonable facsimile was possible in the future. These neo-Nazis and their allies realized that any rehabilitation of Nazism could be accomplished only by discrediting the Holocaust.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Elmer Barnes===
[[Harry Elmer Barnes]], at one time a mainstream American historian, assumed a Holocaust-denial stance in his later years. Between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Barnes was an [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] writer and a leader of the [[historical revisionism]] movement. Starting in 1924, Barnes worked closely with the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]], a German government-funded think tank whose sole purpose was to disseminate the official government position that Germany was the victim of Allied aggression in 1914 and that the [[Versailles Treaty]] was morally invalid.&lt;ref name=Herwig&gt;Herwig, Holger "Clio Deceived" pp. 5–44 from ''International Security'', Volume 12, Issue 2, Fall 1987, pp. 22–23 &amp; 26&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Major Alfred von Wegerer, a [[Völkisch movement|''völkisch'']] activist, the organization portrayed itself as a scholarly society, but historians later described it as "a clearinghouse for officially desirable views on the outbreak of the war."&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, Holger "Clio Deceived" pp. 5–44 from ''International Security'', Volume 12, Issue 2, Fall 1987, pp. 21–23 &amp; 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, Barnes became convinced that allegations made against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], including the Holocaust, were wartime propaganda which had been used to justify the United States' involvement in World War II. Barnes claimed that there were two false claims made about World War II, namely that Germany started the war in 1939, and the Holocaust, which Barnes claimed did not happen.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 75"&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'' (New York: Free Press, 1993) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1962 pamphlet, ''Revisionism and Brainwashing'', Barnes claimed that there was a "lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct".&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes argued that there was "a failure to point out the atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans".&lt;ref name=" Lipstadt, Deborah page 74"&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'' (New York: Free Press, 1993) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that in order to justify the "horrors and evils of the Second World War", the Allies made the Nazis the "scapegoat" for their own misdeeds.{{R|Lipstadt, Deborah page 75}}

Barnes cited the French Holocaust denier [[Paul Rassinier]], whom Barnes called a "distinguished French historian" who had exposed the "exaggerations of the atrocity stories".{{R|Lipstadt, Deborah page 74}} In a 1964 article, "Zionist Fraud", published in the ''[[American Mercury]]'', Barnes wrote: "The courageous author [Rassinier] lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria, the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner."&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993 page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Rassinier as his source, Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of aggression in both 1914 and 1939 and that reports of the Holocaust were propaganda to justify a war of aggression against Germany.{{R|Lipstadt, Deborah page 74}}

===Beginnings of the modern denial movement===
[[File:KKK holocaust a zionist hoax.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]]: [[Nazi salute]] and Holocaust denial]]
In 1961, a protégé of Barnes, [[David Hoggan]], published ''Der erzwungene Krieg'' (''The Forced War'') in West Germany, which claimed that Germany had been the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy in 1939. Though ''Der erzwungene Krieg'' was primarily concerned with the origins of World War II, it also down-played or justified the effects of Nazi [[antisemitic]] measures in the pre-1939 period.&lt;ref name=" Lipstadt, Deborah page 71"&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', New York : Free Press ; Toronto : Maxwell Macmillan Canada ; New York ; Oxford : Maxwell Macmillan International, 1993 page 71&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hoggan justified the huge one billion ''Reich''-mark fine imposed on the entire Jewish community in Germany after the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' as a reasonable measure to prevent what he called "Jewish profiteering" at the expense of German insurance companies and alleged that no Jews were killed in the ''Kristallnacht'' (in fact, 91 German Jews were killed in the ''Kristallnacht'').{{R|Lipstadt, Deborah page 71}} Subsequently, Hoggan explicitly denied the Holocaust in 1969 in a book entitled ''The Myth of the Six Million'', which was published by the [[Noontide Press]], a small Los Angeles publisher specializing in antisemitic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfired, Ted: ''Deniers Of The Holocaust: Who They Are, What They Do, Why They Do It'' (Twenty-First Century Books, 2001). Page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Paul Rassinier published ''The Drama of the European Jews''. Rassinier was himself a concentration camp survivor (he was held in [[Buchenwald]] for having helped French Jews escape the Nazis), and modern-day deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research that questions the accepted facts of the Holocaust. Critics argued that Rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that contradicted his assertions; he nevertheless remains influential in Holocaust denial circles for being one of the first deniers to propose that a vast Zionist/Allied/Soviet conspiracy faked the Holocaust, a theme that would be picked up in later years by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah E. Lipstadt, ''History on Trial'', Harcourt:2005 {{ISBN|0-06-059376-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austin App]], a [[La Salle University]] medieval English literature professor, is considered the first major mainstream American holocaust denier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Peter|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1576078129|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;q=%22Austin%20App%22%20holocaust|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2009 pp. 153"&gt;Atkins, Stephen E.

Huerta and Dafna Shiffman-Huerta "Holocaust Denial Literature: Its Place in Teaching the Holocaust", in Rochelle L. Millen.

The publication of [[Arthur Butz]]'s ''[[The Hoax of the Twentieth Century]]: The case against the presumed extermination of European Jewry'' in 1976; and [[David Irving]]'s ''[[Hitler's War]]'' in 1977 brought other similarly inclined individuals into the fold.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipstadt, ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'' 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Butz was a tenured associate professor of electrical engineering at [[Northwestern University]]. In December 1978 and January 1979, [[Robert Faurisson]], a French professor of literature at the [[University of Lyon]], wrote two letters to ''[[Le Monde]]'' claiming that the [[gas chambers]] used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist. A colleague of Faurisson, [[Jean-Claude Pressac]], who initially shared Faurisson's views, later became convinced of the Holocaust's evidence while investigating documents at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in 1979. He published his conclusions along with much of the underlying evidence in his 1989 book, ''Auschwitz: Technique and operation of the gas chambers''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Henry Bienen]], the former president of Northwestern University, has described Arthur Butz's view of the Holocaust as an "embarrassment to Northwestern".&lt;ref name="bienen"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.northwestern.edu/president/arthurbutz.html |title=Message from President Bienen, Northwestern University |last=Bienen |first= Henry S. |date=February 6, 2006 |publisher= Northwestern University |accessdate= September 20, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070501100921/http://www.northwestern.edu/president/arthurbutz.html |archivedate= May 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, sixty of Butz's colleagues from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty signed a censure describing Butz's Holocaust denial as "an affront to our humanity and our standards as scholars".&lt;ref name="tdn"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailynorthwestern.com/2006/02/16/archive-manual/students-faculty-oppose-butz-with-petitions/|title=Students, faculty oppose Butz with petitions|last=Elizabeth|first=Campbell|date=February 16, 2006|publisher=The Daily Northwestern|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also called for Butz to "leave our Department and our University and stop trading on our reputation for academic excellence".{{R|tdn}}

===Institute for Historical Review===
In 1978 [[Willis Carto]] founded the [[Institute for Historical Review]] (IHR), an organization dedicated to publicly challenging the commonly accepted history of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="TooCloseForComfort"&gt;Chip Berlet &amp; Matthew J. Lyons, ''Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort'', New York: Guilford Press, 2000, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The IHR's founding was inspired by [[Austin App]], a [[La Salle University|La Salle]] professor of medieval English literature and considered the first major American holocaust denier.{{R|Atkins, Stephen E. 2009 pp. 153}} The IHR sought from the beginning to establish itself within the broad tradition of historical revisionism, by soliciting token supporters who were not from a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] background such as [[James J. Martin]] and [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], and by promoting the writings of French socialist Paul Rassinier and American anti-war historian Harry Elmer Barnes, in an attempt to show that Holocaust denial had a base of support beyond neo-Nazis. The IHR republished most of Barnes's writings, which had been out of print since his death. While it included articles on other topics and sold books by mainstream historians, the majority of material published and distributed by IHR was devoted to questioning the facts surrounding the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans, ''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial'', Basic Books, 2002 ({{ISBN|0-465-02153-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the IHR promised a $50,000 reward to anyone who could prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz. [[Mel Mermelstein]] wrote a [[letter to the editor]]s of the ''[[LA Times]]'' and others including ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''. The IHR wrote back, offering him $50,000 for proof that Jews were, in fact, gassed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mermelstein, in turn, submitted a notarized account of his internment at Auschwitz and how he witnessed Nazi guards ushering his mother and two sisters and others towards (as he learned later) gas chamber number five. Despite this, the IHR refused to pay the reward. Represented by public interest attorney [[William John Cox]], Mermelstein subsequently sued the IHR in the [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]] for [[breach of contract]], [[anticipatory repudiation]], [[libel]], [[injurious denial of established fact]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], and [[declaratory relief]] (see [[case no. C 356 542]]). On October 9, 1981, both parties in the Mermelstein case filed motions for [[summary judgment]] in consideration of which Judge Thomas T. Johnson of the [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]] took "[[judicial notice]] of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944,"&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | title = California Judge Rules Holocaust Did Happen | date = October 10, 1981 | page = A26 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/10/us/california-judge-rules-holocaust-did-happen.html | accessdate = November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="order"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/m/mermelstein.mel/ftp.py?people/m/mermelstein.mel//mermelstein.order.072285 | title = Mel Mermelstein v.

On August 5, 1985, Judge Robert A. Wenke entered a judgment based upon the [[Stipulation]] for Entry of Judgment agreed upon by the parties on July 22, 1985. The judgment required IHR and other defendants to pay $90,000 to Mermelstein and to issue a letter of apology to "Mr. Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald, and all other survivors of Auschwitz" for "pain, anguish and suffering" caused to them.{{R|order}}

In the "About the IHR" statement on their website, the IHR states, "The IHR does not 'deny' the Holocaust. Indeed, the IHR as such has no 'position' on any specific event...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihr.org/main/about.shtml|title=About the IHR: Our Mission and Record|author=|date=May 2018|work=Institute for Historical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators and historians have noted the misleading nature of statements by the IHR that they are not Holocaust deniers. [[Paul Rauber]] writes that:

{{quote|The question [of whether the IHR denies the Holocaust] appears to turn on IHR's Humpty-Dumpty word game with the word Holocaust. According to Mark Weber, associate editor of the IHR's [[Journal of Historical Review]] [now Director of the IHR], "If by the 'Holocaust' you mean the political persecution of Jews, some scattered killings, if you mean a cruel thing that happened, no one denies that. But if one says that the 'Holocaust' means the systematic extermination of six to eight million Jews in concentration camps, that's what we think there's not evidence for." That is, IHR doesn't deny that the Holocaust happened; they just deny that the word 'Holocaust' means what people customarily use it for.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Paul Rauber]], ''[[East Bay Express]]'', January 17, 1992, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]]:

{{quote|Like many individual Holocaust deniers, the Institute as a body denied that it was involved in Holocaust denial. It called this a 'smear' which was 'completely at variance with the facts' because 'revisionist scholars' such as Faurisson, Butz 'and bestselling British historian David Irving acknowledge that hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed and otherwise perished during the Second World War as a direct and indirect result of the harsh anti-Jewish policies of Germany and its allies'. But the concession that a relatively small number of Jews were killed was routinely used by Holocaust deniers to distract attention from the far more important fact of their refusal to admit that the figure ran into the millions, and that a large proportion of these victims were systematically murdered by gassing as well as by shooting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. ''Telling Lies About Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial'', Verso, 2002, {{ISBN|1-85984-417-0}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust===
In 1987, Bradley R. Smith, a former media director of the Institute for Historical Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive2/usa/usa.htm|title=United States of America|author=|date=1998|work=axt.org.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620114155/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive2/usa/usa.htm|archivedate=June 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/codoh.asp "Poisoning the Web&amp;nbsp;– Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust."] ''[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]''. 2001. April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, CODOH has repeatedly tried to place advertisements questioning whether the Holocaust happened, especially in college campus newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/holocaust/bradley_smith.asp "Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust: The New College Try".] ''[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]''. 2001. April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which have not always been rejected as a large number of colleges accepted the ads because they felt not doing so would undercut the [[First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/issue_holocaust/BradleySmith2000.asp "The 1999–2000 Bradley Smith Campus Newspaper Campaign".] ''[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]''. 2001. April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley Smith has sought other avenues to promote Holocaust denial&amp;nbsp;– with little success. On September 8, 2009,  student newspaper ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' ran a paid ad from Bradley R Smith. It was quickly criticized and an apology was issued from the editor, claiming it was a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/09/09/massachusetts.harvard.holocaust/index.html|title=Harvard Crimson says Holocaust denial ad published by accident|last=Buxbaum|first=Evan|date=September 10, 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- For the whole paragraph as it falls under [[Wikipedia: Biographies of living persons]]--&gt; College newspapers refused Smith's ads from that point until his death in 2016, generally concluding that refusing to accept his paid advertisements did not comprise a violation of Smith's First Amendment rights.

Smith referred to his tactics as the CODOH campus project. He said, "I don't want to spend time with adults anymore, I want to go to students. They are superficial. They are empty vessels to be filled." "What I wanted to do was I wanted to set forth three or four ideas that students might be interested in, that might cause them to think about things or to have questions about things. And I wanted to make it as simple as possible, and to set it up in a way that could not really be debated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/smith_codoh/words.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=10 |title=Bradley Smith, Holocaust Denial, Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust – Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust deniers have placed "Full page advertisements in college and university newspapers, including those of [[Brandeis University]], [[Boston College]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], and [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] (part of [[City University of New York|CUNY]]).

===James Keegstra===
{{Details|R. v. Keegstra}}
In 1984, [[James Keegstra]], a Canadian high-school teacher, was charged under the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] for "promoting hatred against an identifiable group by communicating anti-Semitic statements to his students".  During class, he would describe Jews as a people of profound evil who had "created the Holocaust to gain sympathy." He also tested his students in exams on his theories and opinion of Jews.

Keegstra was charged under s 281.2(2) of the ''Criminal Code'' (now s 319(2), which provides that "Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group" commits a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c C-34, s 281.2(2);  now ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 319(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was convicted at trial before the [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]].  The court rejected the argument, advanced by Keegstra and his lawyer, [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], that promoting hatred is a constitutionally protected freedom of expression as per [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Keegstra appealed to the [[Alberta Court of Appeal]].  That court agreed with Keegstra, and he was acquitted.  The Crown then appealed the case to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], which ruled by a 4–3 majority that promoting hatred could be [[R. v. Keegstra#Reasons of the court|justifiably]] restricted under [[Section 1 of the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms|s 1 of the Charter]]. The Supreme Court restored Keegstra's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/695/index.do ''R v Keegstra'', [1990&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 697.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was fired from his teaching position shortly afterward.&lt;ref&gt;*"The trouble erupted when the teacher's anti-Jewish (and, incidentally, anti-Catholic) views attracted complaints from certain Eckville parents, thereby inviting intervention from the district school superintendent, Robert David, in 1981. A train of events was launched that finally led to Keegstra's dismissal and subsequent indictment." Alan Davies, "The Keegstra Affair", in Alan T. Davies, ''Antisemitism in Canada: History and Interpretation'', Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88920-216-8}}, p. 228.
*"Far from arguing that Keegstra had a civil right to continue spreading his dreck at Eckville High, civil libertarians wonder (along with the rest of Canada, we hope) why it took twelve years for the local school board to exercise its appropriate authority and fire him. But at least Keegstra was finally fired, and was finally removed from his position as Mayor of Eckville."

===Zündel trials===
{{See also|Leuchter report}}
The Toronto-based photo retoucher [[Ernst Zündel]] operated a small-press called [[Samisdat Publishers]], which published and distributed Holocaust-denial material such as ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' by Richard Harwood (a pseudonym of [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]&amp;nbsp;– a British neo-Nazi). In 1985, he was tried in ''[[R. v. Zundel]]'' and convicted under a "false news" law and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an [[Ontario]] court for "disseminating and publishing material denying the Holocaust".&lt;ref name="Zundelcourt"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=R. v. Zundel |vol=|reporter=|opinion=|pinpoint=|court=|date=August 27, 1992|url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992rcs2-731/1992rcs2-731.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] was a witness for the prosecution at the 1985 trial. Zündel's conviction was overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he was again convicted. The 1988 trial included, as witnesses for the defense, [[Fred A. Leuchter]], [[David Irving]] and [[Robert Faurisson]]. The pseudo-scientific [[Leuchter report]] was presented as a defense document and was published in Canada in 1988 by Zundel's Samisdat Publishers, and in Britain in 1989 by Irving's Focal Point Publishing. In both of his trials, Zündel was defended by [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Douglas Christie]] and [[Barbara Kulaszka]]. His conviction was overturned in 1992 when the Supreme Court of Canada declared the "false news" law unconstitutional.{{R|Zundelcourt}}

Zündel has a website, web-mastered by his wife Ingrid, which publicises his viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;[(www.Zundelsite.org) Zundelsite] Accessed June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission|Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] delivered a ruling in a complaint involving his website, in which it was found to be contravening the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]]. The court ordered Zündel to cease communicating hate messages. In February 2003, the American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] arrested him in [[Tennessee]], USA, on an immigration violations matter, and few days later, Zündel was sent back to Canada, where he tried to gain refugee status. Zündel remained in prison until March 1, 2005, when he was deported to Germany and prosecuted for disseminating hate propaganda. On February 15, 2007, Zündel was convicted on 14 counts of incitement under Germany's ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' law, which bans the incitement of hatred against a portion of the population, and given the maximum sentence of five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=c61ce061-50b2-42a5-bb2f-a7bbaecccceb&amp;k=32537 |title=German court sentences Ernst Zundel to 5 years in prison for Holocaust denial |agency=The Canadian Press |publisher=canada.com |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=February 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104434/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=c61ce061-50b2-42a5-bb2f-a7bbaecccceb&amp;k=32537 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ernst Nolte===
The German philosopher and historian [[Ernst Nolte]], starting in the 1980s, advanced a set of theories, which though not denying the Holocaust appeared to flirt with an Italian Holocaust denier, [[Carlo Mattogno]],  as a serious historian.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard J. page 83"&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''In Hitler's Shadow'' New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the Israeli historian [[Otto Dov Kulka]] of December 8, 1986, Nolte criticized the work of the French Holocaust denier [[Robert Faurisson]] on the ground that the Holocaust did occur, but went on to argue that Faurisson's work was motivated by what Nolte claimed were the admirable motives of sympathy towards the Palestinians and opposition to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Charles ''The Unmasterable Past'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988 page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1987 book ''Der europäische Bürgerkrieg'' (''The European Civil War''), Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are "often honourable", and that some of their claims are "not obviously without foundation".{{R|Evans, Richard J. page 83}}&lt;ref name=LipstadtDenying214&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', New York: Free Press, 1993 page 214&lt;/ref&gt; Nolte himself, though he has never denied the occurrence of the Holocaust, has claimed that the [[Wannsee Conference]] of 1942 never happened, and that the minutes of the conference were post-war forgeries done by "biased" Jewish historians designed to discredit Germany.{{R|LipstadtDenying214}}

The British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the "negative myth" of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by "biased" Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte takes considerable pains to stress are not exclusively Germans or fascists.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 176"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretations'', London: Arnold, 1989 page 176&lt;/ref&gt; In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something.{{R|Kershaw, Ian page 176}}

In a 1990 interview, Nolte implied that there was something to the [[Leuchter report]]: "If the revisionists [Holocaust deniers] and Leuchter among them have made it clear to the public that even 'Auschwitz' must be an object of scientific inquiry and controversy then they should be given credit for this. Even if it finally turned out that the number of victims was even greater and the procedures were even more horrific than has been assumed until now."&lt;ref&gt;Brinks, Jan Hermann ''Children of a New Fatherland'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1993 book ''Streitpunkte'' (''Points of Contention''), Nolte praised the work of Holocaust deniers as superior to "mainstream scholars".&lt;ref name="Wistrich, Robert S pages 293-301"&gt;Wistrich, Robert S. "Holocaust Denial" pages 293–301 from ''The Holocaust Encyclopedia'' edited by Walter Laqueur, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 page 299&lt;/ref&gt; Nolte wrote that "radical revisionists have presented research which, if one is familiar with the source material and the critique of the sources, is probably superior to that of the established historians of Germany".{{R|Wistrich, Robert S pages 293-301}}&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'' New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview with ''Der Spiegel'' magazine, Nolte stated "I cannot rule out the importance of the investigation of the gas chambers in which they looked for remnants of the [chemical process engendered by Zyklon B]", and that "'Of course, I am against revisionists, but Fred Leuchter's 'study' of the Nazi gas ovens has to be given attention, because one has to stay open to 'other' ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] in his 1989 book ''In Hitler's Shadow'' expressed the view that Nolte's reputation as a scholar was in ruins as a result of these and other controversial statements on his part.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York, NY: Pantheon, 1989 page 123&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] in a 2003 interview stated: {{quote|Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are, in some ways, even more dangerous than the deniers. Nolte is an anti-Semite of the first order, who attempts to rehabilitate Hitler by saying that he was no worse than Stalin; but he is careful not to deny the Holocaust. Holocaust-deniers make Nolte's life more comfortable. They have, with their radical argumentation, pulled the center a little more to their side. Consequently, a less radical extremist, such as Nolte, finds himself closer to the middle ground, which makes him more dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Mayer controversy===
In 1988, the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]] published a book entitled ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', which did not explicitly deny the Holocaust, but according to [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] lent support to Holocaust denial by stating that most people who died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] were the victims of "natural causes" such as disease, not gassing.&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is The Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992 pages 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; Dawidowicz argued that Mayer's statements about Auschwitz were "a breathtaking assertion".&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is The Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992 page 130&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust historian [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] has written that Mayer's book is as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name="Pelt pages 47-48"&gt;Pelt, Robert Jan van ''The Case for Auschwitz'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002 pages 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust deniers such as [[David Irving]] have often cited Mayer's book as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial.{{R|Pelt pages 47-48}} Though Mayer has been often condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll, his book does not deny the use of gas chambers at Auschwitz, as Holocaust deniers often claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Some mainstream Holocaust historians have labeled Mayer a denier. The Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]] wrote that Mayer "popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial".&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Yehuda "A Past That Will Not Away" pages 12–22 from ''The Holocaust and History'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abrahm Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998 page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of Mayer argue that his statement that "Sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable" has been taken out of context, particularly by Holocaust deniers.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael &amp; Grobman, Alex ''Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 page 126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] observe that the paragraph from which the statement is taken asserts that the SS destroyed the majority of the documentation relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are "rare" and "unreliable".&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael &amp; Grobman, Alex ''Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 pages 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ken McVay and ''alt.revisionism''===
[[Ken McVay]], an American resident in Canada, was disturbed by the efforts of organizations like the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] to suppress the speech of the Holocaust deniers, feeling that it was better to confront them openly than to try to censor them. On the [[Usenet]] newsgroup ''alt.revisionism'' he began a campaign of "truth, fact, and evidence", working with other participants on the newsgroup to uncover factual information about the Holocaust and counter the arguments of the deniers by proving them to be based upon misleading evidence, false statements, and outright lies. He founded the [[Nizkor Project]] to expose the activities of the Holocaust deniers, who responded to McVay with personal attacks, slander, and death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.protocol.gov.bc.ca/protocol/prgs/obc/1995/1995_KMcVay.htm |title=O.B.C Biography&amp;nbsp;– Kenneth McVay |access-date=June 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081625/http://www.protocol.gov.bc.ca/protocol/prgs/obc/1995/1995_KMcVay.htm |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Irving and the Lipstadt libel case===
{{Main|Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Denying the holocaust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Book cover of ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'' (1993) by [[Deborah Lipstadt]], the work that led to a [[Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt| failed libel case]] by [[David Irving]] ]] --&gt;
[[Deborah Lipstadt]]'s 1993 book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'' sharply criticized various Holocaust deniers, including British author [[David Irving]], for deliberately misrepresenting evidence to justify their preconceived conclusions. In 1996 Irving filed a [[libel]] suit against Lipstadt and her publisher, [[Penguin Books]]. American historian [[Christopher Browning]], an expert witness for the defense, wrote a comprehensive essay for the court summarizing the voluminous evidence for the reality of the Holocaust, and under cross-examination, effectively countered all of Irving's principal arguments to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J. Evans | title = Telling Lies about Hitler | publisher=Verso | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-85984-417-0 | page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge historian [[Richard J. Evans]], another defense expert witness, spent two years examining Irving's writings, and confirmed his misrepresentations, including evidence that he had knowingly used forged documents as source material. The judge, [[Charles Gray (judge)|Justice Charles Gray]], ultimately delivered a long and decisive verdict in favor of Lipstadt that referred to Irving as a "Holocaust denier" and "right-wing pro-Nazi [[polemic]]ist."&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, ''History on Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on Allied war crimes in Holocaust denial literature===
The focus on supposed Allied atrocities during the war has been a theme in Holocaust denial literature, particularly in countries where outright denial of the Holocaust is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Atkins, ''Holocaust denial as an international movement'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]], the concept of "comparable Allied wrongs", such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]] and the [[bombing of Dresden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Evans| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard J. Evans| title = Dresden and Holocaust Denial| work=David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition| year = 1996| url = http://hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/520e.html| accessdate =23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is at the center of, and a continuously repeated theme of, contemporary [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Politically motivated historical revisionism|Holocaust denial]]; a phenomenon she calls "immoral equivalencies".&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah. ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', Bt Bound, 1999, pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Vidal-Naquet pointed out the same phenomenon in the earlier version of ''Les Assassins de la mémoire'' under the title ''Auschwitz et le tiers monde'' (''Les Assassins de la mémoire'', Paris, 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–180), and accurately about the declarations of [[Klaus Barbie]]'s lawyer [[Jacques Vergès]]. In 1977, [[Martin Broszat]], in a review of [[David Irving]]'s book ''[[Hitler's War]]'', maintained that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to imply moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states with both sides equally guilty of terrible crimes, leading to Hitler's "fanatical, destructive will to annihilate" being downgraded to being "no longer an exceptional phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin. "Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses" pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch page 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propaganda===
According to James Najarian, Holocaust deniers working for the Institute for Historical Review are not trained in history and "put out sham scholarly articles in the mock-academic publication, the ''Journal of Historical Review''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=74 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&amp;sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appeal to "our objectivity, our sense of fair play, and our distrust of figurative language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=76 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&amp;sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they rely on facts to grab the readers' attention. These facts, however, are strung by what Najarian calls "fabricated decorum" and are re-interpreted for their use. For example, they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=80 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&amp;sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2015}}&lt;!-- Which "inconsistencies in numbers" are being referred to here? --&gt;

Holocaust denial propaganda in all forms has been shown to influence the audiences that it reaches. In fact, even the well-educated—that is, college graduates and current university students alike—are susceptible to such propaganda when it is presented before them. This stems from the growing disbelief that audiences feel after being exposed to such information, especially since Holocaust witnesses themselves are decreasing in number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasson |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Defending Truth: Legal and Psychological Aspects of Holocaust Denial |journal=Current Psychology |volume=26 |issue=3–4 |page=256 |url=http://www.schaler.net/Lasson.pdf |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |doi=10.1007/s12144-007-9013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies centered on the psychological effects of Holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion. Linda M. Yelland and William F. Stone, in particular, show that Denial essays decrease readers' belief in the Holocaust, regardless of their prior Holocaust awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yelland |first1=Linda M. |last2=Stone |first2=William F. |year=1996 |title=Belief in the Holocaust: Effects of Personality and Propaganda |journal=Political Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |page=559 |jstor=3791968 |doi=10.2307/3791968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments ==
===Japan===
In February 1995 the Japanese magazine ''Marco Polo'', a 250,000-circulation monthly published by [[Bungei Shunju]], ran a Holocaust denial article by physician Masanori Nishioka which stated:

{{quote|The '[[Holocaust]]' is a fabrication. There were no execution [[gas chambers]] in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] or in any other [[concentration camp]]. Today, what are displayed as 'gas chambers' at the remains of the Auschwitz camp in Poland are a post-war fabrication by the Polish communist regime or by the [[Soviet Union]], which controlled the country. Not once, neither at Auschwitz nor in any territory controlled by the Germans during the Second World War, was there 'mass murder of Jews' in 'gas chambers.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihr.org/other/marco_polo.html Masanori Nishioka, "The Greatest Taboo of Postwar World History: There Were No Nazi 'Gas Chambers'" ''Marco Polo'', February 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Los Angeles-based [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] instigated a [[boycott]] of Bungei Shunju advertisers, including [[Volkswagen]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]]. Within days, Bungei Shunju shut down ''Marco Polo'' and its editor, Kazuyoshi Hanada, quit, as did the president of Bungei Shunju, Kengo Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihr.org//jhr/v15/v15n2p-9_Weber.html "The IHR Denounces Campaign Against Japanese Publishing Company," ''The Journal of Historical Review,'' March/April 1995 (Vol. 15, No. 2), page 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In Turkey, in 1996, the Islamic preacher [[Harun Yahya]] distributed thousands of copies of a book which was originally published the previous year, entitled ''Soykırım Yalanı'' ("The Holocaust Lie") and mailed unsolicited texts to American and European schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hopkins, [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/organizations/harunyahya.html "Harun Yahya and Holocaust Revisionism"], The TalkOrigins Archive [Posted: draft: December 7, 2003].&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Soykırım Yalanı'' sparked much public debate.&lt;ref name="axt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/turkey/turkey.htm |title=Turkey |author= |date=1996 |work=axt.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519190843/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/turkey/turkey.htm |archivedate=May 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book claims, "what is presented as Holocaust is the death of some Jews due to the typhus plague during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat of the Germans."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081208201358/http://members.fortunecity.com/vural/bks/HOLOCAUST.HTML The Holocaust Deception&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1996, a Turkish painter and intellectual, [[Bedri Baykam]], published a strongly worded critique of the book in the Ankara daily newspaper ''Siyah-Beyaz'' ("Black and White").

===France===
In France, Holocaust denial became more prominent in the 1990s as ''[[Historical revisionism (negationism)|négationnisme]]'', though the movement has existed in ultra-left French politics since at least the 1960s, led by figures such as [[Pierre Guillaume]] (who was involved in the bookshop [[La Vieille Taupe]] during the 1960s). Recently, elements of the extreme far right in France have begun to build on each other's negationist arguments, which often span beyond the Holocaust to cover a range of antisemitic views, incorporating attempts to tie the Holocaust to the Biblical massacre of the [[Canaanites]], critiques of Zionism, and other material fanning what has been called a "conspiratorial Judeo-phobia" designed to legitimize and "banalize" antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Joseph Golsan, ''Vichy's Afterlife'', University of Nevada Press, 2003, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
In Belgium in 2001, [[Roeland Raes]], the ideologue and vice-president of one of the country's largest political parties, the [[Vlaams Belang]] (formerly named [[Vlaams Blok]], Flemish Bloc), gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of [[Anne Frank]]'s diary. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,449278,00.html Belgium's far right party in Holocaust controversy], ''The Guardian'', Friday, March 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and chose to disband. Immediately afterwards, it legally reformed under the new name Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) with the same leaders and the same membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3994867.stm Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist], BBC News, November 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The trial of a Canadian woman, Monika Schaefer and her German-Canadian brother, Alfred Schaefer started in Germany in early July 2018. They were charged with ''Volksverhetzung'', "incitement to hatred". The pair had published video clips on [[YouTube]] of their denial of the genocide of Jews. In the clips, Alfred Schaefer said that Jews wanted to destroy Germans, blamed them for starting both World Wars, and referred to the Holocaust as a "Jewish fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Reut (May 8, 2018) [https://www.bnaibrith.ca/canadian_alfred_schaefer_convicted_of_holocaust_denial_in_germany "Canadian Alfred Schaefer Convicted of Holocaust Denial in Germany"] [[B'Nai Brith|B'Nal Brith Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2018,  Monika Schaefer was convicted of the charge of "incitement of the people" (often reworded as ''incitement of hatred'' by the news media). She was sentenced to ten months while Alfred Schaefer, also convicted, received a sentence of three years and two month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/alberta-holocaust-denier-guilty-of-inciting-hatred-in-german-court |title=Alberta Holocaust denier guilty of inciting hatred in German court |date= 26 October 2018 |work= National Post |access-date= 28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys conducted by [[Sammy Smooha]] of the [[University of Haifa]] found that the fraction of Israeli Arabs denying that millions of Jews were murdered by the Nazis increased from 28% in 2006 to 40% in 2008.&lt;ref name=Smooha&gt;{{cite web |author=Sammy Smooha |title=The 2008 Index of Arab-Jewish Relations in Israel: Main Findings and Trends of Change |url=http://soc.haifa.ac.il/~s.smooha/uploads/editor_uploads/files/Index2008MainFindings_TrendsChangeEng.pdf |year=2009 |access-date=June 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806134653/http://soc.haifa.ac.il/~s.smooha/uploads/editor_uploads/files/Index2008MainFindings_TrendsChangeEng.pdf |archive-date=August 6, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooha commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Arab eyes disbelief in the very happening of the Shoah is not hate of Jews (embedded in the denial of the Shoah in the West) but rather a form of protest. Arabs not believing in the event of Shoah intend to express strong objection to the portrayal of the Jews as the ultimate victim and to the underrating of the Palestinians as a victim. They deny Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state that the Shoah gives legitimacy to. Arab disbelief in the Shoah is a component of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, unlike the ideological and anti-Semitic denial of the Holocaust and the desire to escape guilt in the West.{{R|Smooha}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reactions to Holocaust denial==
{{Further|Criticism of Holocaust denial}}

===Types of reaction===
Scholarly response to Holocaust denial can be roughly divided into three categories. Some academics refuse to engage Holocaust deniers or their arguments at all, on grounds that doing so lends them unwarranted legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heitmeyer]] and John Hagan, ''International Handbook of Violence Research'', Springer: 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A second group of scholars, typified by the American historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]], have tried to raise awareness of the methods and motivations of Holocaust denial without legitimizing the deniers themselves. "We need not waste time or effort answering the deniers' contentions," Lipstadt wrote. "It would be never-ending.... Their commitment is to an ideology and their 'findings' are shaped to support it."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipstadt, 1992 interview with Ken Stern of the American Jewish Committee&lt;/ref&gt; A third group, typified by the [[Nizkor Project]], responds to arguments and claims made by Holocaust denial groups by pointing out inaccuracies and errors in their evidence.&lt;ref name=66-q&amp;a&gt;{{cite web|title=Holocaust denial – The IHR's Questions &amp; Answers, and Nizkor's Responses|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar00.html|work=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Hilliard &amp; Michael C. Keith. ''Waves of Rancor: tuning in the radical right'', M.E. Sharpe, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7656-0131-1}}, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wolfish &amp; Gordon S. Smith. ''Who Is Afraid of the State?: Canada in a World of Multiple Centres of Power'', University of Toronto Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8020-8388-9}}, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even scholarly responses, however, can trigger vigorous rebuttals. In 1996, the British Holocaust denier [[David Irving]] brought [[Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt|a civil defamation suit]] against Lipstadt and her publisher, stemming from Lipstadt's book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'', in which she named Irving as "one of the more dangerous" Holocaust deniers, because he was a published author, and was viewed by some as a legitimate military historian. He was "familiar with historical evidence", she wrote, and "bends it until it conforms with his ideological leanings and political agenda". Irving, who appeared as a defense witness in [[Ernst Zündel]]'s [[R. v. Zundel|trial]] in Canada, and once declared at a rally of Holocaust deniers that "more women died in the [[Chappaquiddick incident|back seat of Edward Kennedy's car]] than ever died in a gas chamber at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]],"&lt;ref&gt;Holocaust Denial on Trial [http://www.hdot.org/trial HDOT.org]. Retrieved September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Lipstadt's allegation damaged his reputation. After a two-month trial in London, the trial judge issued a 333-page ruling against Irving.&lt;ref&gt;Bazyler, Prof. Michael J: Holocaust Denial Laws and Other Legislation Criminalizing Promotion of Nazism.

In December 1991 the [[American Historical Association]] issued the following statement: ''The American Historical Association Council strongly deplores the publicly reported attempts to deny the fact of the Holocaust. No serious historian questions that the Holocaust took place.'' This followed a strong reaction by many of its members and commentary in the press against a near-unanimous decision that the AHA had made in May 1991 that studying the ''significance of the Holocaust'' should be encouraged. The association's May 1991 statement was in response to an incident where certain of its members had questioned the reality of the Holocaust. The December 1991 declaration is a reversal of the AHA's earlier stance that the association should not set a precedent by certifying historical facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/1991/9112/9112RES.CFM "AHA Statement on Holocaust Denial"], [[American Historical Association]] website.

===Public figures and scholars===

A number of public figures and scholars have spoken out against Holocaust denial, with some – such as literary theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] – likening Holocaust denial to "part of the extermination itself".&lt;ref&gt;Golsan, 130&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Historical Association]], the oldest and largest society of historians and teachers of history in the United States, states that Holocaust denial is "at best, a form of academic fraud".&lt;ref name="adaaha"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gerstenfeld|first=Phyllis B.|author2=Grant, Diana Ruth|title=Crimes of hate: selected readings|publisher=SAGE|location=p. 190.|year=2004|page=391|isbn=0-7619-2943-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] said: "Remembering is a necessary rebuke to those who say the Holocaust never happened or has been exaggerated. Holocaust denial is the work of bigots; we must reject their false claims whenever, wherever and by whomever they are made."&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4653666.stm Annan condemns Holocaust denial], January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner [[Elie Wiesel]], during a 1999 discussion at the [[White House]] in Washington D.C., called the Holocaust "the most documented tragedy in [[recorded history]].

===Former SS members===
Critics of Holocaust denial also include members of the Auschwitz SS. Camp physician and SS-''[[Untersturmführer]]'' [[Hans Münch]] considered the facts of Auschwitz "so firmly determined that one cannot have any doubt at all", and described those who negate what happened at the camp as "malevolent" people who have "personal interest to want to bury in silence things that cannot be buried in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, Bernhard.

''The Case for Auschwitz: Evidence from the Irving Trial''. Indiana University Press, 2002, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zyklon B]] handler and SS-''[[Oberscharführer]]'' [[Josef Klehr]] said that anyone who maintains that nobody was gassed at Auschwitz must be "crazy or in the wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Demant, Ebbo (Hg.): ''Auschwitz&amp;nbsp;– "Direkt von der Rampe weg...."

===Holocaust denial and antisemitism===
The ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'' defines Holocaust denial as "a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-old motifs".&lt;ref name=EGCAH45&gt;"Holocaust denial is a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-old motifs." Dinah Shelton, ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'', Macmillan Reference, 2005, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has stated that "Holocaust denial is a contemporary form of the classic anti-Semitic doctrine of the evil, manipulative and threatening world Jewish conspiracy"&lt;ref name=ADLguide&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Holocaust/theory.asp "Introduction: Denial as Anti-Semitism"], Holocaust Denial: An Online Guide to Exposing and Combating Anti-Semitic Propaganda, [[Anti-Defamation League]] website. Retrieved August 27, 2009. {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French historian Valérie Igounet has written that "Holocaust denial is a convenient polemical substitute for anti-semitism."&lt;ref name=Igounet&gt;Igounet, Valérie. [http://mondediplo.com/1998/05/08igou "Holocaust denial is part of a strategy"], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Reich, psychiatrist and then senior scholar at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], one-time director of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], and now professor of international affairs at [[George Washington University]]:

{{quote|The primary motivation for most deniers is anti-Semitism, and for them the Holocaust is an infuriatingly inconvenient fact of history. After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened—indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media? What better way, in short, to make the world safe again for anti-Semitism than by denying the Holocaust?&lt;ref name=ReichNYT&gt;Reich, Walter. [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/books/erasing-the-holocaust.html "Erasing the Holocaust"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 11, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French historian [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] described the motivation of deniers more succinctly:

===Definition of antisemitism===
{{main|Working Definition of Antisemitism}}
In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) published a working definition of antisemitism which gave as an example of the way that antisemitism might manifest itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://fathomjournal.org/book-review%E2%94%82the-definition-of-anti-semitism/&lt;/ref&gt;

A definition based on the EUMC definition was later adopted by the U.S. Department of State.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ajc.org/news/defining-anti-semitism-is-the-first-step-towards-stopping-it&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) the successor agency to the EUMC removed the definition from the organisation's website in 'a clear-out of non-official documents'.

==Examination of claims==
{{Main|Criticism of Holocaust denial}}

The key claims which cause Holocaust denial to differ from established fact are:{{R|Key elements|Assertions}}

*The Nazis had no official policy or intention of exterminating Jews.
*Nazis did not use [[gas chamber]]s to mass murder Jews.&lt;ref name=NP-gas-chambers&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to Holocaust denial on the existence of Gas Chambers and Crematoria|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/american/skeptic-magazine/skeptic-12.html|work=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The figure of 5 to 6&amp;nbsp;million Jewish deaths is a gross exaggeration, and the actual number is an [[order of magnitude]] lower.

Other claims include the following:
*Stories of the Holocaust were a myth initially created by the [[Allies of World War II]] to demonize Germans,{{R|Assertions}} Jews having spread this myth as part of a grander plot intended to enable the creation of a Jewish homeland in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and now to garner continuing support for the state of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;A plot designed to garner support of Israel:
*"The central assertion for the deniers is that Jews are not victims but victimizers. They 'stole' billions in reparations, destroyed Germany's good name by spreading the 'myth' of the Holocaust, and won international sympathy because of what they claimed had been done to them. In the paramount miscarriage of injustice, they used the world's sympathy to 'displace' another people so that the state of Israel could be established. This contention relating to the establishment of Israel is a linchpin of their argument." [[Deborah Lipstadt]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&amp;nbsp;– The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', Penguin, 1993, p. 27. {{ISBN|0-452-27274-2}}.
*"Jews are thus depicted as manipulative and powerful conspirators who have fabricated myths of their own suffering for their own ends. According to the Holocaust deniers, by forging evidence and mounting a massive propaganda effort, the Jews have established their lies as 'truth' and reaped enormous rewards from doing so: for example, in making financial claims on Germany and acquiring international support for Israel."

*"Why, we might ask the deniers, if the Holocaust did not happen would any group concoct such a horrific story? Because, some deniers claim, there was a conspiracy by Zionists to exaggerate the plight of Jews during the war in order to finance the state of Israel through war reparations."

*"They [Holocaust deniers] picture a vast shadowy conspiracy that controls and manipulates the institutions of education, culture, the media and government in order to disseminate a pernicious mythology. The purpose of this Holocaust mythology, they assert, is the inculcation of a sense of guilt in the white, Western Christian world. Those who can make others feel guilty have power over them and can make them do their bidding. This power is used to advance an international Jewish agenda centered in the Zionist enterprise of the State of Israel."

Retrieved June 12, 2007.
*"The stress on Holocaust revisionism underscored the new anti-Semitic agenda gaining ground within the Klan movement. Holocaust denial refurbished conspiratorial anti-Semitism. Who else but the Jews had the media power to hoodwink unsuspecting masses with one of the greatest hoaxes in history? And for what motive? To promote the claims of the illegitimate state of Israel by making non-Jews feel guilty, of course." Lawrence N. Powell, ''Troubled Memory: Anne Levy, the Holocaust, and David Duke's Louisiana'', University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8078-5374-7}}, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Documentary evidence of the Holocaust, from photographs to ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', is fabricated.{{R|Assertions}}
*Survivor testimonies are filled with errors and inconsistencies, and are thus unreliable.{{R|Assertions}}
*Interrogators obtained Nazi prisoners' confessions of war crimes through the use of torture.{{R|Assertions}}
*The Nazi treatment of Jews was no different from what the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] did to their enemies in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer &amp; Grobman, 2002, pp. 103–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust denial is widely viewed as failing to adhere to [[Historical method|principles for the treatment of evidence]] that mainstream historians (as well as scholars in other fields) regard as basic to [[reason|rational inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;"(H)istory is the attempt to describe events of the past and move from description to analysis, in accordance with certain agreed rules of evidence, of analysis of language, and of logic."

Much of the controversy surrounding the claims of Holocaust deniers centers on the methods used to present arguments that the Holocaust allegedly ''never happened as commonly accepted''. Numerous accounts have been given by Holocaust deniers (including evidence presented in court cases) of claimed facts and evidence; however, independent research has shown these claims to be based upon flawed research, biased statements, or even deliberately falsified evidence. Opponents of Holocaust denial have documented numerous instances in which such evidence was altered or manufactured (see [[Nizkor Project]] and [[David Irving]]). According to [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], "in our society of image and spectacle, extermination on paper leads to extermination in reality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], French "une tentative d'extermination sur le papier qui relaie l'extermination réelle" in ''Les assassins de la mémoire'', ''Un Eichmann de papier'', Postface de Gisèle Sapiro, Nouvelle édition revue et augmentée, La Découverte, Paris, 2005, {{ISBN|2-7071-4545-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws against Holocaust denial==
{{Main|Laws against Holocaust denial}}
Holocaust denial is explicitly or implicitly illegal in 17 countries: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

In 2010 the Parliament of Hungary adopted legislation punishing the denial of the genocides committed by National Socialist or Communist systems, without mentioning the word "Holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/Politics/2010-06-10/nazism-communism-hungary-equate.html Hungary equates Communism to Nazism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726120759/http://rt.com/Politics/2010-06-10/nazism-communism-hungary-equate.html |date=July 26, 2010 }}, rt.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Such legislation remains controversial. In October 2007, a tribunal declared Spain's Holocaust denial law [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;By way of [http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/jurisprudencia/Stc2007/STC2007-5152-2000.html judgment of November 7, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215233053/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/jurisprudencia/Stc2007/STC2007-5152-2000.html |date=February 15, 2008 }} of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]], which ruled the criminalization to be unconstitutional and void.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Italy rejected a denial law proposing a prison sentence of up to four years. In 2006 the Netherlands rejected a draft law proposing a maximum sentence of one year on denial of genocidal acts in general, although specifically denying the Holocaust remains a criminal offense there. The United Kingdom has twice rejected [[Laws against Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial laws]]. Denmark and Sweden have also rejected such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/world/europe/19iht-eu.4.5359640.html EU adopts measure outlawing Holocaust denial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].

A number of deniers have been prosecuted under various countries' denial laws. French literature professor [[Robert Faurisson]], for example, was convicted and punished under the [[Gayssot Act]] in 1990. Some historians oppose such laws, among them [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], an outspoken critic of Faurisson, on the grounds that denial legislation imposes "historical truth as legal truth".&lt;ref&gt;''To live with Faurisson? Any other attitude would imply that we were imposing historical truth as legal truth, which is a dangerous attitude available to other fields of application.'' [http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/VidalNaquet92a/ Pierre Vidal-Naquet: A Paper Eichmann (1980)&amp;nbsp;– Anatomy of a Lie (10) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics favor [[criminalization]]. Holocaust denial, they contend, is "the worst form of racism and its most respectable version because it pretends to be a research".&lt;ref&gt;François de Smet, Philosopher of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|ULB]]: ''Le négationnisme est l'une des pires formes de racisme.

In February 2006 Irving was convicted in Austria, where Holocaust denial is illegal, for a speech he had made in 1989 in which he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.{{R|release}} Irving was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant, but chose to go to Austria anyway "to give a lecture to a far-right student fraternity".&lt;ref name="release"&gt;"Holocaust denier to be released" (December 20, 2006): [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6196073.stm BBC News] Retrieved January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he pleaded guilty to the charge, Irving said he had been "mistaken", and had changed his opinions on the Holocaust. "I said that then, based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews."&lt;ref name="BBCCenshorship"&gt;BBC Report [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4733820.stm Holocaust Denier is Jailed], February 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving served 13 months of a 3-year sentence in an Austrian prison, including the period between his arrest and conviction, and was deported in early 2007.{{R|release}} The episode sparked intense international debate over the limits of freedom of speech. Upon hearing of Irving's sentence, Lipstadt said, "I am not happy when censorship wins, and I don't believe in winning battles via censorship.... The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with truth."{{R|BBCCenshorship}}

According to ''[[CNN]]'', upon Irving's return to the UK, he "vow[ed] to repeat views denying the Holocaust that led to his conviction" stating he felt "no need any longer to show remorse" for his Holocaust views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/21/uk.irving.ap/index.html |title=Holocaust denier: 'No need to show remorse' |accessdate=2016-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116221731/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/21/uk.irving.ap/index.html |archivedate=January 16, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genocide denials==
{{Main|Genocide denial}}

Other acts of genocide have met similar attempts to deny and minimize them. [[Gregory H. Stanton]], formerly of the US State Department and the founder of Genocide Watch, lists denial as the final stage of a genocide development: "Denial is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further [[genocidal massacre]]s. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Stanton, [http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/8stagesofgenocide.html Eight Stages of Genocide Denial], Genocide Watch&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The denier movement gained some of its first supporters in France. One of these, Maurice Bardèche, presented one of the deniers' fundamental arguments, namely that the Holocaust was caused by the Jews themselves. The Jews were the enemies of Germany and were treated accordingly. Bardèche was also one of the first to question the authenticity of the source material. For instance, he strongly doubted that the gas chambers at Auschwitz had been used to kill people. Instead, he advanced the proposition that they had been used for disinfecting clothes – since then one of the deniers' most persistent allegations."

Numerous Nazi books and publications denying the Holocaust were confiscated, along with videotapes, pamphlets, and other materials in Spanish, English, and German. Page proofs of new publications yet to go to press were also confiscated, demonstrating the Europa was one of the largest producers of antisemitic material in Europe. Indeed, Librería Europa's 1996 catalogue listed several publications about the composer Richard Wagner, Nordic and Scandinavian mythology, Nazi art, the Luftwaffe and Waffen SS, works by Julius Evola, and various Holocaust denial publications by Erik Norling, Carlos Caballero, and Salvador Borrego. Varela was arrested, and place on provisional liberty awaiting the trial. Thus, with the new law, it is possible to curb the activities of racist groups.

*"Before discussing how Holocaust denial constitutes a conspiracy theory, and how the theory is distinctly American, it is important to understand what is meant by the term 'Holocaust denial'. Holocaust deniers, or 'revisionists', as they call themselves, question all three major points of definition of the Nazi Holocaust. First, they contend that, while mass murders of Jews did occur (although they dispute both the intentionality of such murders as well as the supposed deservedness of these killings), there was no official Nazi policy to murder Jews. Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1&amp;nbsp;million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers. And third, Holocaust deniers contend that the death toll of European Jews during World War II was well below 6&amp;nbsp;million. Deniers float numbers anywhere between 300,000 and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million, as a general rule." Mathis, Andrew E.

*"In part III we directly address the three major foundations upon which Holocaust denial rests, including ... the claim that gas chambers and crematoria were used not for mass extermination but rather for delousing clothing and disposing of people who died of disease and overwork; ... the claim that the six million figure is an exaggeration by an order of magnitude—that about six hundred thousand, not six million, died at the hands of the Nazis; ... the claim that there was no intention on the part of the Nazis to exterminate European Jewry and that the Holocaust was nothing more than the unfortunate by-product of the vicissitudes of war."

&lt;ref name=Assertions&gt;"The kinds of assertions made in Holocaust-denial material include the following:
*Several hundred thousand rather than approximately six million Jews died during the war.
*Scientific evidence proves that gas chambers could not have been used to kill large numbers of people.
*The Nazi command had a policy of deporting Jews, not exterminating them.
*Some deliberate killings of Jews did occur, but were carried out by the peoples of Eastern Europe rather than the Nazis.
*Jews died in camps of various kinds, but did so as the result of hunger and disease (most died to the unavailability of food due to allied bombings). The Holocaust is a myth created by the Allies for propaganda purposes, and subsequently nurtured by the Jews for their own ends.
*Errors and inconsistencies in survivors' testimonies point to their essential unreliability.
*Alleged documentary evidence of the Holocaust, from photographs of concentration camp victims to Anne Frank's diary, is fabricated.
*The confessions of former Nazis to war crimes were extracted through torture."

&lt;ref name="terminology"&gt;Denial vs. "revisionism":
*"This is the phenomenon of what has come to be known as 'revisionism', 'negationism', or 'Holocaust denial,' whose main characteristic is either an outright rejection of the very veracity of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, or at least a concerted attempt to minimize both its scale and importance.... It is just as crucial, however, to distinguish between the wholly objectionable politics of denial and the fully legitimate scholarly revision of previously accepted conventional interpretations of any historical event, including the Holocaust."

*"The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (1993) and [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about an historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a 'certain body of irrefutable evidence' or a 'convergence of evidence' that suggest that an event—like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust—did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence...." Ronald J. Berger.

*"This essay describes, from a methodological perspective, some of the inherent flaws in the 'revisionist' approach to the history of the Holocaust. It is not intended as a polemic, nor does it attempt to ascribe motives. Rather, it seeks to explain the fundamental error in the 'revisionist' approach, as well as why that approach of necessity leaves no other choice. It concludes that 'revisionism' is a misnomer because the facts do not accord with the position it puts forward and, more importantly, its methodology reverses the appropriate approach to historical investigation.... 'Revisionism' is obliged to deviate from the standard methodology of historical pursuit, because it seeks to mold facts to fit a preconceived result; it denies events that have been objectively and empirically proved to have occurred; and because it works backward from the conclusion to the facts, thus necessitating the distortion and manipulation of those facts where they differ from the preordained conclusion (which they almost always do). In short, 'revisionism' denies something that demonstrably happened, through methodological dishonesty." McFee, Gordon.

*"Holocaust denial can be a particularly insidious form of antisemitism precisely because it often tries to disguise itself as something quite different: as genuine scholarly debate (in the pages, for example, of the innocuous-sounding Journal for Historical Review). Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as 'revisionists', in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities. There are, of course, a great many scholars engaged in historical debates about the Holocaust whose work should not be confused with the output of the Holocaust deniers. Debate continues about such subjects as, for example, the extent and nature of ordinary Germans' involvement in and knowledge of the policy of genocide, and the timing of orders given for the extermination of the Jews. However, the valid endeavour of historical revisionism, which involves the re-interpretation of historical knowledge in the light of newly emerging evidence, is a very different task from that of claiming that the essential facts of the Holocaust, and the evidence for those facts, are fabrications."

*"The deniers' selection of the name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in the traditional practice of illuminating the past. For historians, in fact, the name revisionism has a resonance that is perfectly legitimate&amp;nbsp;– it recalls the controversial historical school known as World War I 'revisionists', who argued that the Germans were unjustly held responsible for the war and that consequently the Versailles treaty was a politically misguided document based on a [[false premise]]. Thus the deniers link themselves to a specific historiographic tradition of reevaluating the past. Claiming the mantle of the World War I revisionists and denying they have any objective other than the dissemination of the truth constitute a tactical attempt to acquire an intellectual credibility that would otherwise elude them."

After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened&amp;nbsp;– indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media?

'''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15924''', '''Codes for the representation of names of scripts''', defines two sets of codes for a number of [[writing system]]s (scripts). Each script is given both a four-letter code and a numeric one.&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Everson|first=Michael|title=ISO 15924:2004|url=http://unicode.org/iso15924/|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Script is defined as "set of graphic characters used for the written form of one or more languages".&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004 /&gt; 

Where possible the codes are derived from [[ISO 639-2]] where the name of a script and the name of a language using the script are identical (example: [[Gujarati script|Gujarātī]] ISO 639 guj, ISO 15924 Gujr). Preference is given to the 639-2 Bibliographical codes, which is different from the otherwise often preferred use of the Terminological codes.&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004 /&gt;

4-letter ISO 15924 codes are incorporated into the Language Subtag Registry for [[IETF language tag]]s and so can be used in file formats that make use of such language tags. For example, they can be used in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] to help [[Web browser]]s determine which [[typeface]] to use for foreign text. This way one could differentiate, for example, between [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbian]] written in the Cyrillic (&lt;code&gt;sr-Cyrl&lt;/code&gt;) or Latin (&lt;code&gt;sr-Latn&lt;/code&gt;) script, or mark [[romanization|romanized]] text as such.

==Maintenance==
ISO has appointed the [[Unicode Consortium]] as the Registration Authority (RA) for the standard. In 2004, the RA appointed [[Michael Everson]] to act as Registrar. The Registrar works with a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) in developing and implementing the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/iso15924/ Unicode - ISO 15924 Registration Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The JAC contains six members: the Registrar, one member from the Library of Congress, one from Standards Norway, one from the French Encyclopaedia Universalis, an officer of Unicode, and a member of Unicode. These individuals represent the interests of the ISO 15924 RA, the ISO 639-2 RA, ISO Technical Committee 37, ISO Technical Committee 46, and the ISO Coded Character Set Sub-Committee, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2.&lt;ref name="JAC info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Advisory Committee ISO 15924 /RA-JAC|url=http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924jac.html|publisher=ISO, Unicode, Inc. &amp; Evertype|accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Innatism''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] doctrine that holds that the mind is born with ideas/knowledge, and that therefore the mind is not a "[[blank slate]]" at birth, as early [[Empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[John Locke]] claimed. It asserts that not all knowledge is gained from experience and the [[senses]]. [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] are prominent philosophers in the development of innatism and the notion that the mind is already born with ideas, knowledge and beliefs.&lt;ref name=:Schmaltz/&gt; Both philosophers emphasize that experiences are the key to unlocking this knowledge but not the source of the knowledge itself. Essentially, no knowledge is derived exclusively from one's experiences as empiricists like John Locke suggested.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stich, S. P. (1975). ''Innate ideas''. Berkley, CA: University of California Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference from nativism ==

In general usage, the terms ''innatism'' and ''nativism'' are synonymous as they both refer to notions of preexisting ideas present in the mind. However, more correctly,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} innatism refers to the philosophy of [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]], who assumed that a God or a similar being or process placed innate ideas and principles in the human mind.&lt;ref name=:Schmaltz&gt;Tad M. Schmaltz, ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativism represents an adaptation of this, grounded in the fields of [[genetics]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[psycholinguistics]]. Nativists hold that innate beliefs are in some way genetically programmed to arise in our mind&amp;mdash;that innate beliefs are the [[phenotypes]] of certain [[genotypes]] that all humans share in common.

== Nativism ==

{{main|Psychological nativism}}

Nativism is a modern view rooted in innatism. The advocates of nativism are mainly philosophers who also work in the field of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[psycholinguistics]]: most notably [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] (although the latter has adopted a more critical attitude towards nativism in his later writings). The nativist's general objection against [[empiricism]] is still the same as was raised by the [[Rationalism|rationalists]]; the human mind of a newborn child is not a [[tabula rasa]], but equipped with an inborn structure.

== Innate idea ==

In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], an '''innate idea''' is a [[concept]] or item of [[knowledge]] which is said to be ''[[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] to all [[human race|humanity]]''—that is, something people are born with rather than something people have ''learned'' through experience.

The issue is controversial, and can be said to be an aspect of a long-running [[nature versus nurture]] debate, albeit one localized to the question of understanding human [[cognition]].

=== Philosophical debate ===

Although individual human beings obviously vary due to cultural, racial, linguistic and era-specific influences, innate ideas are said to belong to a more fundamental level of human cognition. For example, the philosopher [[René Descartes]] theorized that knowledge of [[God]] is innate in everybody as a product of the faculty of faith.

Other philosophers, most notably the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], were critical of the theory and denied the existence of any innate ideas, saying all human knowledge was founded on experience, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.

Philosophically, the debate over innate ideas is central to the conflict between [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] [[Epistemology|epistemologies]]. While rationalists believe that certain ideas exist independently of experience, empiricism claims that all knowledge is derived from experience.

[[Immanuel Kant]] was a German philosopher who is regarded as having ended the impasse in modern philosophy between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized these two early modern traditions in his thought.

==== Plato ====
[[Plato]] argues that if there are certain concepts that we know to be true but did not learn from experience then it must be because we have an innate knowledge of it and this knowledge must have been gained before birth. In Plato's ''[[Meno]]'', he recalls a situation in which [[Socrates]], his mentor, questioned a slave boy about a geometry theorem. Though the slave boy had no previous experience with geometry, he was able to generate the right responses to the questions he was asked. Plato reasoned that this was possible as Socrates' questions sparked the innate knowledge of math the boy had had from birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacewing, M. (n.d.). Innate knowledge''. Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/AS/ReasonandExperience/Innate-knowledge.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Descartes ====
[[Descartes]] conveys the idea that innate knowledge or ideas is something inborn such as one would say, that a certain disease might be 'innate' to signify that a person might be at risk of contacting such a disease. He suggests that something that is 'innate' is effectively present from birth and while it may not reveal itself then, is more than likely to present itself later in life. Descartes comparison of innate knowledge to an innate disease, whose symptoms may only show up later in life, unless prohibited by a factor like age or puberty, suggests that if an event occurs prohibiting someone from exhibiting an innate behaviour or knowledge, it doesn’t mean the knowledge did not exist at all but rather it wasn’t expressed – they were not able to acquire that knowledge. In other words, innate beliefs, ideas and knowledge require experiences to be triggered or they may never be expressed. Experiences are not the source of knowledge as proposed by John Locke, but catalysts to the uncovering of knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== John Locke ====
The main antagonist to the concept of innate ideas is [[John Locke]], a contemporary of Leibniz. Locke argued that the mind is in fact devoid of all knowledge or ideas at birth; it is a blank sheet or ''tabula rasa''. He argued that all our ideas are constructed in the mind via a process of constant composition and decomposition of the input that we receive through our senses.

Locke, in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', suggests that the concept of universal assent in fact proves nothing, except perhaps that everyone is in agreement; in short universal assent proves that there is universal assent and nothing else. Moreover, Locke goes on to suggest that in fact there ''is'' no universal assent. Even a phrase such as "What is, is" is not universally assented to; infants and severely handicapped adults do not generally acknowledge this [[truism]]. Locke also attacks the idea that an innate idea can be imprinted on the mind without the owner realizing it. For Locke, such reasoning would allow one to conclude the absurd: “all the Truths a Man ever comes to know, will, by this account, be, every one of them, innate.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0sdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22%E2%80%9Call+the+Truths+a+Man+ever+comes+to+know,+will,+by+this+account,+be,+every+one+of+them,+innate%E2%80%9D+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DVgzhSVEu8&amp;sig=MufLd5R0cx-LNt3Xf3CwjrJApkI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb27iUxpDdAhUOEawKHWYVCLkQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%E2%80%9Call%20the%20Truths%20a%20Man%20ever%20comes%20to%20know,%20will,%20by%20this%20account,%20be,%20every%20one%20of%20them,%20innate%E2%80%9D%20%22&amp;f=false|title=An essay concerning human understanding: and a treatise on the conduct of the understanding. Complete in one volume with the author's last additions and corrections|last=Locke|first=John|date=1860|publisher=Hayes &amp; Zell|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To return to the musical analogy, we may not be able to recall the entire melody until we hear the first few notes, but we were aware of the fact that we knew the melody and that upon hearing the first few notes we would be able to recall the rest.

Locke ends his attack upon innate ideas by suggesting that the mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' or "blank slate", and that all ideas come from experience; all our knowledge is founded in sensory experience.

Essentially, the same knowledge thought to be ''a priori'' by Leibniz is in fact, according to Locke, the result of empirical knowledge, which has a lost origin [been forgotten] in respect to the inquirer. However, the inquirer is not cognizant of this fact; thus, he experiences what he believes to be ''a priori'' knowledge.

1) The theory of innate knowledge is excessive. Even innatists accept that most of our knowledge is learned through experience, but if that can be extended to account for all knowledge, we learn colour through seeing it, so therefore, there is no need for a theory about an innate understanding of colour.

2) No ideas are universally held. Do we all possess the idea of God? Do we all believe in justice and beauty? Do we all understand the law of identity? If not, it may not be the case that we have acquired these ideas through impressions/experience/social interaction (this is the children's and idiot's criticism).

3) Even if there are some universally agreed statements, it is just the ability of the human brain to organize learned ideas/words, that is, innate. An "ability to organize"  is not the same as "possessing propositional knowledge" (e.g., a computer with no saved files has all the operations programmed in but has an empty memory).

==== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ====
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] suggested that we are born with certain innate ideas, the most identifiable of these being mathematical [[truism]]s. The idea that ''1 + 1 = 2'' is evident to us without the necessity for [[empirical evidence]]. Leibniz argues that empiricism can only show us that concepts are true in the present; the observation of one apple and then another in one instance, and in that instance only, leads to the conclusion that one and another equals two. However, the suggestion that one and another will always equal two require an innate idea, as that would be a suggestion of things unwitnessed.

Leibniz called such concepts as mathematical truisms "necessary truths". Another example of such may be the phrase, "what is, is" or "it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be". Leibniz argues that such [[truism]]s are universally assented to (acknowledged by all to be true); this being the case, it must be due to their status as innate ideas. Often there are ideas that are acknowledged as necessarily true but are not universally assented to. Leibniz would suggest that this is simply because the person in question has not become aware of the innate idea, not because they do not possess it. Leibniz argues that empirical evidence can serve to bring to the surface certain principles that are already innately embedded in our minds. This is similar to needing to hear only the first few notes in order to recall the rest of the melody.

=== Scientific ideas ===

In his ''[[Meno]]'', Plato raises an important epistemological quandary: How is it that we have certain ideas which are not conclusively derivable from our environments? [[Noam Chomsky]] has taken this problem as a philosophical framework for the scientific enquiry into innatism. His linguistic theory, which derives from 18th century [[Classical liberalism|classical-liberal]] thinkers such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], attempts to explain in cognitive terms how we can develop knowledge of systems which are said, by supporters of innatism, to be too rich and complex to be derived from our environment. One such example is our linguistic faculty. Our linguistic systems contain a systemic complexity which supposedly could not be empirically derived: the environment seems too poor, variable and indeterminate, according to Chomsky, to explain the extraordinary ability to learn complex concepts possessed by very young children. Essentially, their accurate grammatical knowledge cannot have originated from their experiences as their experiences are not adequate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It follows that humans must be born with a universal innate grammar, which is determinate and has a highly organized directive component, and enables the language learner to ascertain and categorize language heard into a system. Chomsky states that the ability to learn how to properly construct sentences or know which sentences are grammatically incorrect is an ability gained from innate knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Noam Chomsky cites as evidence for this theory, the apparent invariability, according to his views, of human languages at a fundamental level. In this way, linguistics may provide a window into the human mind, and establish scientific theories of innateness which otherwise would remain merely speculative.

One implication of Noam Chomsky's innatism, if correct, is that at least a part of human knowledge consists in cognitive predispositions, which are triggered and developed by the environment, but not determined by it. Chomsky suggests that we can look at how a belief is acquired as an input-output situation. He supports the doctrine of innatism as he states that human beliefs gathered from sensory experience are much richer and complex than the experience itself. He asserts that the extra information gathered is from the mind itself as it cannot solely be from  experiences. Humans derive excess amount of information from their environment so some of that information must be pre-determined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parallels can then be drawn, on a purely speculative level, between our moral faculties and language, as has been done by sociobiologists such as [[E. O. Wilson]] and evolutionary psychologists such as [[Steven Pinker]]. The relative consistency of fundamental notions of morality across cultures seems to produce convincing evidence for these theories. In psychology, notions of [[archetypes]] such as those developed by [[Carl Jung]], suggest determinate identity perceptions.

=== Scientific evidence for innateness ===
Evidence for innatism is being found by neuroscientists working on the [[Blue Brain Project]]. They discovered that [[neuron]]s transmit signals despite an individual's experience. It had been previously assumed that neuronal circuits are made when the experience of an individual is imprinted in the brain, making memories. Researchers at Blue Brain discovered a network of about fifty neurons which they believed were building blocks of more complex knowledge but contained basic innate knowledge that could be combined in different more complex ways to give way to acquired knowledge, like memory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Pousaz, L. (2011, March 22). ''New evidence for innate knowledge''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://actu.epfl.ch/news/new-evidence-for-innate-knowledge-5/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists ran tests on the neuronal circuits of several rats and ascertained that if the neuronal circuits had only been formed based on an individual's experience, the tests would bring about very different characteristics for each rat. However, the rats all displayed similar characteristics which suggests that their neuronal circuits must have been established previously to their experiences – it must be inborn and created prior to their experiences. The research done in the Blue Brain project expresses that some the building blocks of all our knowledge, is genetic and we're born with it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Learning vs. innate knowledge ==

There are two ways in which animals can gain knowledge. The first of these two ways is learning. This is when an animal gathers information about its surrounding environment and then proceeds to use this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it has learned not to eat this again. The second way that an animal can acquire knowledge is through innate knowledge. This knowledge is genetically inherited. The animal automatically knows it without any prior experience. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge and the evolution of learning ===

In a changing environment, an animal must constantly be gaining new information in order to survive. However, in a stable environment this same individual need only to gather the information it needs once and rely on it for the duration of its life. Therefore, there are different scenarios in which learning or innate knowledge is better suited.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of having it determined whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighed the benefit of having it, then the individual would not have evolved to learn in this scenario; instead, non-learning would evolve. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighed the cost of obtaining it, then the animal would be far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs then learning would simply be unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario – and because learning could prove to be disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information – non-learning evolves.  However, if an environment were in a constant state of change then learning would also prove to be disadvantageous. Anything learned would immediately become irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt; The learned information would no longer apply. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning would evolve.

However, in environments where change occurs but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing and adapts to changes in the environment as opposed to innate knowledge.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35247">'''Interpersonal emotion regulation''' is the process of changing the emotional experience of one's self or another person through social interaction. It encompasses both '''intrinsic emotion regulation''' (also known as [[emotional self-regulation]]), in which one attempts to alter their own feelings by recruiting social resources, as well as '''extrinsic emotion regulation''', in which one deliberately attempts to alter the trajectory of other people's feelings.

== History of concept ==
The concept of interpersonal emotion regulation stems from earlier research into [[emotional self-regulation]], which is the within-person process whereby people influence and change their own feelings.&lt;ref name="Gross2"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of psychology has traditionally focused on ''intra''personal processes in which a person manages their own emotions individually outside of the social context&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barthel|first=Abigail L.|last2=Hay|first2=Aleena|last3=Doan|first3=Stacey N.|last4=Hofmann|first4=Stefan G.|date=2018-10-18|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: A Review of Social and Developmental Components|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/bec.2018.19|journal=Behaviour Change|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/bec.2018.19|issn=0813-4839}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, modern theories have expanded the concept of emotion regulation to include ''inter''personal processes, in which emotion is regulated with or through other people. Interpersonal models emphasize that humans are social creatures who rarely experience emotions in isolation, and instead more commonly share, express, and manage their emotions with the help of others.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckes|first=Lane|last2=Coan|first2=James A.|date=2011|title=Social Baseline Theory: The Role of Social Proximity in Emotion and Economy of Action|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=976–988|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W.

== Concept ==

=== Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves managing one's own emotions through social interaction&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, such as seeking [[social support]] or [[reassurance]] from others. Examples include calling a friend for advice, venting to a partner about a stressful situation, or engaging in conversation as a distraction from distress. In addition to regulating negative emotions, people also seek to amplify positive emotions by sharing good news with others. As with intrapersonal emotion regulation, people typically attempt to use interpersonal emotion regulation improve their affective state by decreasing negative emotions or increase positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Jeanne L.|date=2007|title=Ideal Affect: Cultural Causes and Behavioral Consequences|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|issn=1745-6916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation refers to the deliberate influence of others' [[emotion|feelings]].&lt;ref name="Niven"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2009). A classification of controlled interpersonal affect regulation strategies. Emotion, 9, 498-509.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many ways how social factors influence an individual's emotions&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, S. G. &amp; Doan, S. N. (2018). "The social foundations of emotion: Developmental, cultural, and clinical dimensions". Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{ISBN|978-1433829277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include trying to cheer up a friend who is upset, trying to make one's partner feel guilty for neglecting oneself, or trying to calm a stressed coworker. These examples illustrate that interpersonal emotion regulation may be used to make others feel better or worse, although making others feel better appears to be far more common.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== In groups ===
Many instances of interpersonal emotion regulation, such as those described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the feelings of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the feelings of a whole group of followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M. (2000). Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence. Human relations, 53, 1027-1055.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the feelings of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1996). Managing the emotions of others. Symbolic Interaction, 19, 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation is used in most of the important social relationships that we have. Within the fields of developmental and clinical [[psychology]], researchers have long-recognized that people try to influence others' emotions (e.g., mothers influence the feelings of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1994). The effects of mothers' physical and emotional unavailability on emotion regulation. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 59, 208-227.&lt;/ref&gt; therapists try to alleviate the sadness of their clients&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, H. C., Barkham, M., Stiles, W. B., &amp; Goldfried, M. R. (2002). Patterns of client emotion in helpful sessions of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy. Journal of counseling psychology, 49, 376-380.&lt;/ref&gt;). More recently, social and organizational psychologists have also documented the use of interpersonal emotion regulation within romantic and familial relationships&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Macdonald, I., &amp; Holman, D. (2012). You spin me right round: Cross-relationship variability in interpersonal emotion regulation. Frontiers in Psychology, 3, 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangelisti, A. L., Daly, J. A., &amp; Rudnick, J. R. (1991). Making people feel guilty in conversations: Techniques and correlates. Human Communication Research, 18, 3-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a range of work settings (e.g., hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L. E., Monahan, K., &amp; Berger, C. (1999). A laughing matter? The uses of humor in medical interactions. Motivation and Emotion, 23, 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; law firms,&lt;ref&gt;Lively, K. J. (2000). Reciprocal emotion management: Working together to maintain stratification in private law firms. Work and Occupations, 27, 32-63.&lt;/ref&gt; debt collection agencies,&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;Sutton, R. I. (1991). Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors. Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 245-268.&lt;/ref&gt; and prisons&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2007). Changing moods and influencing people: The use and effects of emotional influence behaviours at HMP Grendon. Prison Service Journal, 173, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt;). Interpersonal emotion regulation may even be used towards complete strangers as a way of making social interactions run more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E., &amp; Eggleston, R. (1994). Managing emotions in public: The case of wheelchair users. Social Psychology Quarterly, 57, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related processes ===

Interpersonal emotion regulation overlaps with [[social support]], which involves giving others emotional, informational, or practical support.&lt;ref&gt;House, J. S., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1985). Measures and concepts of social support. In S. Cohen and S. L. Syme (Eds.), Social support and health (pp. 79-108). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Models of interpersonal emotion regulation specify social support within the framework of regulatory goals to improve the feelings of one's self (by seeking support) or another person (by providing support). Emotion regulation mechanisms of social support include attentional deployment (e.g. distraction away from negative thoughts and toward the conversation) and cognitive change (e.g. encouragement to "look on the bright side" or change one's negative interpretation of a given situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation also shares links with other processes by which people come to influence others' emotions, such as [[emotional contagion]], in which the emotions of one person are 'caught' by another person as a result of mere contact (e.g., if someone was having a terrible day, they might 'infect' their friends with their bad mood).&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (1993). Emotional contagion. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2, 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the compulsion to tell other people about our emotional experiences (termed the [[social sharing of emotions]]) can also result in other people coming to feel what we feel.&lt;ref&gt;Rimé, B., Finkenauer, C., Luminet, O., Zech, E., &amp; Philippot, P. (1998). Social sharing of emotion: New evidence and new questions. European review of social psychology, 9, 145-189.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these processes and interpersonal emotion regulation regards the [[Automatic and Controlled Processes (ACP)|level of processing]] involved. Interpersonal emotion regulation is a controlled process, whereby a person intentionally tries to change the way others feel. In contrast, emotional contagion is thought to be relatively [[automaticity|automatic]], engaged without conscious awareness, while social sharing is somewhat more conscious but typically lacks the intent to influence others' emotions.

Interpersonal emotion regulation relates to [[emotional labor]], the [[regulation of emotion]] as part of one's job role.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A. (2000). Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor. Journal of occupational health psychology, 5, 95-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In emotional labor, an employee (usually in a service or care role) is required to manage his or her emotions as part of the job (e.g., 'service with a smile'). Because employees can also be required to manage the emotions of their customers or clients as part of their job (e.g., debt collectors are required to elicit anxiety in relaxed debtors to encourage them to make a payment&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;), interpersonal emotion regulation can be performed as a form of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Cameron, D. (2012). Emotional labor at the unit-level. In A. Grandey, J. Diefendorff, &amp; D. Rupp (Eds.), Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse perspectives on emotion regulation at work. Psychology Press/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related process is interpersonal influence, which involves trying to change the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis, D., Schmidt, S. M., &amp; Wilkinson, I. (1980). Intraorganizational influence tactics: Exploration of getting one's way. Journal of Applied Psychology, 65, 440-452.&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference here is that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.

== Theories ==

=== Social Baseline Theory ===
Drawing from [[evolutionary psychology]], '''social baseline theory''' purports that humans have adapted to function in a social environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J., &amp; Maresh, E. L. (2013). Social baseline theory and the social regulation of emotion. In J. Gross (Ed.), Handbook of emotion regulation (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt; The brain acts under the assumption that proximity to other people is the norm, or baseline condition. As opposed to social isolation, which is associated with stress and poor health, social proximity is associated with attenuated cardiovascular, hormonal, and neural responses to threat, as well as longevity and physical health. The presence of others is theorized to help individuals conserve effort and metabolic resources through the social regulation of emotion. For example, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] is less active during the down-regulation of negative affect while the presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=Naomi I.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Gable|first3=Shelly L.|last4=Hilmert|first4=Clayton J.|last5=Lieberman|first5=Matthew D.|date=2007|title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress responses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|journal=NeuroImage|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|issn=1053-8119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coan|first=James A.|last2=Schaefer|first2=Hillary S.|last3=Davidson|first3=Richard J.|date=2006|title=Lending a Hand|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|journal=Psychological Science|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|issn=0956-7976|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social proximity is hypothesized to confer emotion regulatory benefits through three mechanisms: 1) risk distribution, 2) load sharing, and 3) capitalization. Risk distribution lowers [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] towards threat because risks seem lower as group size increases. Load sharing involves the knowledge that close others can provide help and resources if needed. Finally, capitalization refers to the intensification of positive emotions when they are shared with others.

=== Map of Interpersonal Regulation ===
A prominent model proposed by Jamil Zaki and Craig Williams (2013) conceptualizes different classes of interpersonal emotion regulation along two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W. Craig|date=2013|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0033839|journal=Emotion|volume=13|issue=5|pages=803–810|doi=10.1037/a0033839|issn=1931-1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, intrinsic ''vs'' extrinsic, refers to the target of regulatory efforts. Intrinsic regulation involves an attempt to change one's own emotions through social contact, while extrinsic regulation involves trying to change the emotions of another person or group of people. The second dimension, response-dependent vs. response-independent, refers to whether or not the regulatory efforts depend upon the behavior of other people. Processes that rely upon how others respond or behave are considered response-dependent, while strategies that do not depend upon others' behavior are classified as response-independent. This model yields four classes of interpersonal emotion regulation:

# Intrinsic response-dependent: An individual tries to change their own affect through interaction with another person, whose feedback impacts the regulatory attempt. [[Safety behaviors (anxiety)|Safety behaviors]] fall into this category. For example, to alleviate anxiety a child might seek comfort from his mother, who responds in a soothing manner. Some forms of [[Social sharing of emotions|social sharing]] can also be considered an intrinsic response-dependent strategy, insofar as the listener's feedback influences the speaker's affect. For instance, sharing good news can intensify one's positive affect, but only if the listener responds enthusiastically.
# Intrinsic response-independent: Processes in this category involve attempts to alter one's own emotional experience through social contact, but the regulatory success does not depend upon how others react or behave. Affect labeling, or putting feelings into words, can dampen the intensity of emotional experience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Jared B.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Matthew D.|date=2018-03-20|title=Putting Feelings Into Words: Affect Labeling as Implicit Emotion Regulation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1754073917742706|journal=Emotion Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=116–124|doi=10.1177/1754073917742706|issn=1754-0739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly occurs during communication in social contexts without necessarily relying on the response of others. For instance, describing one's emotions through a conversation may result in a more nuanced understanding of one's feelings that facilitates coping.
# Extrinsic response-dependent: A person acts with the goal of changing another person's emotion, whose feedback plays an important role in indicating the success of the regulatory attempt. Examples include [[prosocial behavior]] and related processes such as [[Empathy|empathic]] responding that endeavor to improve other people's affective state. Feedback from the recipient is needed to signal whether or not they were helped.
# Extrinsic response-independent: This classification includes attempts to change another person's affective experience that to not depend upon that person's feedback. For example, [[Warm-glow giving|warm glow]] giving may result in the achieved extrinsic goal of engaging in prosocial behavior without receiving cues from the recipient as to whether or not they benefitted.

== Strategies ==

There are potentially hundreds of strategies that people can use to influence others' feelings. A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique strategies that could be differentiated primarily according to whether they are used to improve or to worsen others' feelings.&lt;ref name="Niven" /&gt; Another key distinction is between strategies that engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).

Research based on Niven and colleagues' classification has indicated that these distinct strategy types have different effects on the well-being of the people who use them and also on the people who they are used towards.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez-Íñigo, D., Poerio, G. L., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2013). The association between controlled interpersonal affect regulation and resource depletion. Applied Psychology: Health and Well-being.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Headley, T. (2012). Does regulating others' feelings influence people's own affective well-being? Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 246-260.&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have different implications for the quality of the relationship between these two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Holman, D., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2012). How to win friendship and trust by influencing people: An investigation of interpersonal affect regulation and the quality of relationships. Human Relations, 65, 777-805.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to the stage of the emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion,&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have suggested that there is a difference between strategies that try to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies that try to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (2007). Building genuine trust through interpersonal emotion management: A threat regulation model of trust and collaboration across boundaries. Academy of Management Review, 32, 595-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little, L. M., Kluemper, D., Nelson, D. L., &amp; Ward, A. (2013). More than Happy to Help? Customer‐Focused Emotion Management Strategies. Personnel Psychology, 66, 261-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychopathology ==
Patterns of interpersonal emotion dysregulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders.

=== Anxiety disorders ===
[[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] are perpetuated by avoidance of feared stimuli. [[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]] behaviors can include the presence of "safety people", who reduce the anxious individual's distress while [[Negative Reinforcement|negatively reinforcing]] the avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=Stefan G.|date=2014-05-23|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Mood and Anxiety Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=38|issue=5|pages=483–492|doi=10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|issn=0147-5916}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual with panic disorder may ask her partner to drive her to work, which alleviates her fear of having a panic attack while driving. This pattern may lead to reliance upon others and contribute to continued avoidance (e.g. of driving a car alone). Another interpersonal strategy used in anxiety disorders is reassurance seeking. For example, someone with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] may rely upon a roommate to assure them that the doors have been locked, or an individual with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] may ask a romantic partner for reassurances of love.

=== Depression ===
Individuals with depression experience maladaptive interpersonal interactions, which contribute to their depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammen|first=Constance|date=2018-06-07|title=Stress Generation and Depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors include greater expressed negativity (e.g. criticism, blaming, demanding, and disengagement) toward romantic partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davila|first=Joanne|last2=Bradbury|first2=Thomas N.|last3=Cohan|first3=Catherine L.|last4=Tochluk|first4=Shelly|date=1997|title=Marital functioning and depressive symptoms: Evidence for a stress generation model.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=4|pages=849–861|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=William B.|last2=Wenzlaff|first2=Richard M.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|last4=Pelham|first4=Brett W.|date=1992|title=Allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=101|issue=2|pages=293–306|doi=10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|issn=0021-843X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive reassurance seeking is also a vulnerability factor for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joiner|first=Thomas E.|last2=Metalsky|first2=Gerald I.|date=2001-09|title=Excessive Reassurance Seeking: Delineating a Risk Factor Involved in the Development of Depressive Symptoms|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00369|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=371–378|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00369|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborne|first=David W.

Social interaction that diverts attention away from self-referential negative thinking and promotes cognitive reappraisal may help to alleviate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011-12|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borderline personality disorder ===
According to the [[Biosocial theory|biosocial model]],&lt;ref&gt;Linehan, M. M. (1993). Cognitive-behavioral treatment of borderline personality disorder. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] develop intense emotional expression in part because they have been reinforced throughout development. For instance, a teenager with heightened emotional sensitivity is not taken seriously by her family until she threatens a suicide attempt. If her family responds with attention to extreme emotional expressions, she will learn to continue to express emotions in this way. Venting is another interpersonal emotion regulation strategy that is associated with personality disorder symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vollrath|first=Margarete|last2=Alnæs|first2=Randolf|last3=Torgersen|first3=Svenn|date=1998|title=Coping Styles Predict Change in Personality Disorders*|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fguilfordjournals.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1521%2Fpedi.1998.12.3.198|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=3|pages=198–209|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.3.198|issn=0885-579X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon-Gordon|first=Katherine L.|last2=Haliczer|first2=Lauren A.|last3=Conkey|first3=Lindsey C.|last4=Whalen|first4=Diana J.|date=2018|title=Difficulties in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: Initial Development and Validation of a Self-Report Measure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=40|issue=3|pages=528–549|doi=10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|issn=0882-2689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotion Regulation of Others and Self ===
The Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) questionnaire &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure. Current Psychology, 30, 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; is a freely available measure that assess strategies used to improve or worsen either one's own or another person's emotions, yielding a two-by-two framework: 1) intrinsic affect-improving, 2) intrinsic affect-worsening, 3) extrinsic affect-improving, and 4) extrinsic affect-worsening. The ''intrinsic'' subscale measures [[emotion self-regulation]] using 10 items. The ''extrinsic'' subscale measures deliberate attempts to improve or worsen others' emotions using 9 items.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erosresearch.org/index.php/resources/tools/&lt;/ref&gt; There is low item endorsement for the affect-worsening dimension, suggesting that people rarely make deliberate attempts to worsen their own or others' emotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, extrinsic affect-worsening is associated with health-related impairments, suggesting detrimental effects of engaging in these strategies likely due to negative social repercussions. Additionally, the affect-improving factor is unrelated to current levels of affect, which may be attributed to the scale's [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] properties or to a discrepancy between current mood state and strategy use (e.g., reporting use of affect-improving strategies more often while in a negative mood state).

Cognitive Therapy and Research, 40, 341-356. doi: 0.1007/s10608-016-9756-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 20-item measure designed to assess how individuals regulate their own emotions through the use of others. The questionnaire was developed through [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews with participants (e.g., "When you are feeling down, in what ways do you look to other people to help you feel better?"), whose responses were [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] tested using exploratory and confirmatory [[factor analysis]] to derive 4 factors containing 5 items each. The 4 factors include Enhancing Positive Affect (seeking social interaction to enhance happiness), Perspective Taking (recruiting others to point out that other people are in a worse situation), Soothing (seeking comfort and sympathy from others), and Social Modeling (observing others for examples of how to cope).

=== Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion ===
The Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a self-report measure of maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies that may relate to [[psychopathology]]. Respondents rate how likely they would be to use a variety of strategies in response to three vignettes about stressful hypothetical scenarios (task-oriented, romantic, social). The DIRS consists of four factors, including two intrapersonal (Accept, Avoid) and two interpersonal (Reassurance-seek, Vent) classes of strategies. Reassurance-seeking is related to overall emotion dysregulation, as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] symptoms. Both reassurance-seeking and venting are associated with negative affect, interpersonal problems, stress, and [[borderline personality disorder]] symptoms.

An '''intimate part''', '''personal part''' or '''private part''' is a place on the human body which is customarily kept covered by [[clothing]] in public venues and conventional settings, as a matter of [[fashion]] and cultural norms. In several cultures, revealing these parts is seen as a religious offence.

Definitions vary, but usually they are primarily the parts involved in [[sexual arousal]], [[reproduction|procreation]], and elimination of [[excreta]] and related matter, including:
*for both genders: the [[buttocks]], [[human anus|anus]], [[perineum]], [[mons pubis]] and [[groin]]
*for males: the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]
*for females: the [[vulva]] (including [[pudendal cleft]]), [[vagina]] and [[breasts]].

The term ''intimate parts'' may be construed to mean only the external body parts that are visible when [[nudity|naked]], rather than the body parts more commonly referred to. For example, when naked, a woman's pudendal cleft is predominantly visible rather than the [[vagina]], and a man's scrotum is visible rather than the [[testes]] which are contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/nine/000957635.htm |title=Health Information—Find Articles, Tools, and Tips at MerckEngage.com|publisher=Mercksource.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female breasts are considered as parts that would be covered in most contexts but with a degree of tolerance for [[toplessness]] varying in different regions and cultures. For example, Fischtein, Herold and Desmarais (2005) found that acceptance of toplessness in a sample of [[Canadians]] varied depending on both personal factors (such as the respondent's gender, age, and religion) and contextual factors (i.e. toplessness in streets, parks, or beaches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content;col1 |title=Canadian attitudes toward female topless behaviour: a national survey |journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality |first1=Dayna S. |last1=Fischtein |first2=Edward S. |last2=Herold |first3=Serge |last3=Desmarais |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content%3Bcol1 |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some periods of [[History of Europe|European history]], female shoulders and legs may have been considered intimate parts.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} More conservative viewpoints in the West in some contexts still find it appropriate that females should cover their shoulders, particularly when entering a [[Church (building)|church]] or other sacred space.

In Islamic traditions, the definition of [[awrah]] is similar to the definition of intimate parts in [[Western culture]]. The extent of cover for the female body depends upon the situation, but may include the hair, shoulders, and neck in addition to the aforementioned "intimate parts". A majority of scholars agree that the entire body except the face and hands should be covered in public or in front of unrelated non-Muslim women and in front of unrelated men. The exceptions are the scholars from [[Hanafi]] school of thought, which has the largest number of followers, which agree that the feet are not part of the awrah and therefore may be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Religions - Islam: Hijab |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For males, most scholars regard all parts of body from the navel to the knees as awrah.

The intentional exposure of one's intimate parts is a form of [[exhibitionism]]. Such exposure may be subject to strict [[Sociology|social rules]], [[social control]] and even [[criminal justice]], if it is considered to be a form of [[indecent exposure]]. The unintentional exposure of intimate parts (as in the case of a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]") may be connected with feelings of [[shame]].

Intentionally touching the intimate parts of another person, even through [[clothing]], is often associated with [[human sexual behaviour|sexual]] [[intent (law)|intent]]. If this is done without legally valid consent of the person being touched, it is considered groping or in some cases [[sexual harassment]] or [[sexual assault]].

[[Naturism]] is a lifestyle choice that is characterized by the practice of nudity both alone and in groups. Some naturists hold that nakedness is not automatically a sexual state and that covering areas of the body is merely a [[social construct]]: they believe that the [[social norms|norms]] of society can be upheld even when all are nude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inf-fni.org/ International Naturist Federation] Welcome page.

[[Sharia]] or sharia law is the basic Islamic [[religious law]] derived from the religious precepts of [[Islam]], particularly the [[Quran]] and the opinions and life example of [[Muhammad]] ([[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]]) which are the primary [[sources of sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionar Definition of sharia in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L.

[[Syracuse University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}. Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; For topics and issues not directly addressed in these primary sources, sharia is derived. The derivation differs between the various [[Islamic schools and branches|sects of Islam]] ([[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]].&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;Hisham M.

The first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (see [[Justice in the Quran]]), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aboul-Enein|first1=H.

Some have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only [[Separation of church and state#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|first legislated into effect]] after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world.&lt;ref name="church state evolution"&gt;[http://counterjihad.com/separation-church-state-west-sharia "Separation of Church and State: In the West and Under Sharia"] By Immanuel Al-Manteeqi.

Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies.

He further states that the Quran does not use the word jihad to refer to warfare or fighting; such acts are referred to as ''qital''.

According to [[Jonathan Berkey]], jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagans]] of Mecca or the [[Banu Qurayza|Jews of Medina]], but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared.&lt;ref name="Berkey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkey|first=Jonathan Porter|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58813-3|page=73|quote=The Koran is not a squeamish document, and exhort the believers to jihad. Verses such as "Do not follow the unbelievers, but struggle against them mightily" (25.52) and "fight [those who have been given a revelation] who do not believe in God  and the last day" (9.29) may originally have been directed against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but could be redirected once a new set of enemies appeared.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of the law of Jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani]].

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Muhammad in Medina|Medina]] from [[Muhammad in Mecca|Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was [[Al-Hajj|surah 22]], verses 39–40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt;
The main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.&lt;ref name="DavidCook2005"&gt;David Cook, ''Understanding Jihad''; University of California Press: CA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Edwards and [[Sherifa Zuhur]], offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant "no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them." Jihad as a collective duty (''[[Fard]] Kifaya'') and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an "individually incumbent jihad" (''Fard Ayn'') required only "awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Richard |last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and|page=553|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=jihad+declared+by+caliph&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIh7D86LCfyAIVFxKSCh1bnQiW#v=onepage&amp;q=jihad%20declared%20by%20caliph&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Magaard, associate professor at the [[Aarhus University]] Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world.

{{Main article|Caravan raids|Ghazi (warrior)}}
[[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] ([[Wiktionary:ghazi|غازي]]) is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein, H.

The [[Caravan raids]] were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his [[Sahabah|companions]] participated.

Islamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the '[[sword verses]]' and the 'peace verses'".

Ishay has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is "strictly limited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/uk/newsletters/2002/0302ukbulletin.pdf Article on Jihad] by Dr. G.

("Jihad, even when explained as a righteous effort of waging war in self defense against the grossest outrage on one's religion, is strictly limited..")&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Leaman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|authorlink=Oliver Leaman|title=Jewish Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLKcZuGCQ4C&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08868-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all [[Hudna|peace treaties]] that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shariʻa as discourse: legal traditions and the encounter with Europe |first1=Jørgen S.|last1=Nielsen |first2=Lisbet |last2=Christoffersen |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2010 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJ_t0F7ZGEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Quran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22sword%20verses%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0vYYovH7OQC&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of the Quran is elucidated by Hadith (the teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad). Of the 199 references to jihad in perhaps the most standard collection of hadith—[[Sahih Bukhari|Bukhari]]—all refer to warfare.&lt;ref name=bukhari&gt;Muhammad ibn Isma'il Bukhari, The Translation of the Meaning of Sahih al-Bukhari, trans.

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad|Ahmadiyya#Abrogation|Persecution of Ahmadis}}

According to [[Ahmadi]] Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: ''Jihad al-Akbar'' (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; ''Jihad al-Kabīr'' (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the ''pen''; ''Jihad al-Asghar'' (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archivedate=2012-04-14 | title=Suspension of Jihad | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Ross Valentine|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2008|publisher=C.

Various Ahmadis scholars, such as [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]] and [[Basharat Ahmad]], argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionofislam.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the "unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān".&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;[[Yohanan Friedmann|Friedmann]], ''Jihād in Ahmadī Thought'', {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī ''[[fiqh]]'', so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific [[asbab al-nuzul|situation for which it was revealed]]), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="Friedmann"/&gt;

Ahmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised [[Mahdi]] and [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/3in1/chap2/index.html | title=An Enemy a Disbeliever a Liar, Claims of Hadhrat Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Naeem Osman Memon | year=1994 |isbn=1-85372-552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/reflection.html | title=Truth about Ahmadiyyat, Reflection of all the Prophets |publisher=London Mosque | author=B.A Rafiq | year=1978 |isbn=0-85525-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirza Tahir Ahmad 1998"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_7_section_1.html | title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth, Future of Revelation|publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | authorlink=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | year=1998 |isbn=1-85372-640-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Lago|title=The Handbook of Transcultural Counselling and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-23851-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of [[Persecution of religious minorities by Muslims|religious persecution]], [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm "Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography".] Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and crime===
{{Main article|Islamic criminal jurisprudence|Hudud|Qisas|Tazir}}

The Islamic criminal law is [[criminal law]] in accordance with Sharia. Strictly speaking, Islamic law does not have a distinct corpus of "criminal law."

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud—seen as crime against [[Allah]]; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;A.

==Terrorism==

{{Jihadism sidebar}}
{{Islamism sidebar}}
[[Islamic terrorism]] is, by definition, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or [[Islamism|Islamist]] motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, [[Islam and Pedophilia|child-molestation]] and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK |author=Greg Botelho|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in [[Terrorism in the European Union|Europe]], [[Terrorism in Russia|Russia]], and the [[Terrorism in the United States|United States]], and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/isis-ideology-islamic-militants-british-appeal-iraq-syria|title=Isis: a contrived ideology justifying barbarism and sexual control|author=Mona Siddiqui|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/kurdish-peshmerga-kobani-isis-syria|title=Kurdish peshmerga forces arrive in Kobani to bolster fight against Isis|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; state actors and their [[proxy war|proxies]], and politically liberal Muslim protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388593/moderate-muslims-stand-against-isis-christine-sisto|title=Moderate Muslims Stand against ISIS |author=Christine Sisto|work=National Review Online|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pacifism in Islam ==
Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and [[Islam and war|warfare]] has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more violent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, different Muslim movements through history had linked pacifism with [[Muslim theology]].&lt;ref name="Osborn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily Lynn Osborn|title=Our New Husbands Are Here: Households, Gender, and Politics in a West African State from the Slave Trade to Colonial Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vFHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4397-2|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Müller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Müller|title=Religion and Chieftaincy in Ghana: An Explanation of the Persistence of a Traditional Political Institution in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T890Drkv9AoC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90360-0|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An American Witness to India's Partition by Phillips Talbot Year (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of Islam==
===Negative perceptions===
Philip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a [[stereotype]] of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the [[Western world]] as "dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resurgent Islam: a sociological approach |first1=Philip W. |last1=Sutton |first2=Stephen |last2=Vertigans |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |page=7 |quote=Stereotypical views which portray Islam as an inherently violent religion, a 'religion of the sword' and an increasing global threat have thus been reinforced and even extended over recent years. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhx1XlbhFhgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QN4FTaL-Jo7msQOepuWODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Eduardo Campo writes that, "Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Campo |page=374 |publisher = Infobase Publishing| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gleave writes that, "at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials."&lt;ref name="HinnellsKing2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hinnells|author2=Richard King|title=Religion and Violence in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb1OBi3zvdkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08869-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack on the US]] has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times|first=Ram |last=Puniyani |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X30ETYusGcq-nAfihpnmDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corrigan and Hudson, "some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in America: an historical account of the development of American religious life |first1=John|last1=Corrigan |first2=Winthrop Still |last2=Hudson |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |year=2004 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;dq=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TdQFTa6ZAY72tgPb9aDHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[evangelical Christian]]s who have expressed such sentiments include [[Franklin Graham]], an [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[missionary]], and [[Pat Robertson]], an American [[media mogul]], [[executive chairman]], and a former [[Southern Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Nation Challenged: The Religious Right; Islam Is Violent in Nature, Pat Robertson Says |publisher=New York Times |date=23 February 2002 |quote=The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has described Islam as a"violent religion that wants to 'dominate and then, if need be, destroy'."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/23/us/nation-challenged-religious-right-islam-violent-nature-pat-robertson-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey conducted by [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]], a research group affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that two out of three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastors believe that Islam is a "dangerous" religion.

Dr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabistjansen.nl/Arabist/pub_list_Engl_files/RelRootsMusViol.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Framing Islam: An Analysis of U.S. Media Coverage of Terrorism Since 9/11|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=62|pages=90-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed "through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations" (Powell 94)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The key findings are summarized below: 
* The media coverage of terrorism in the U.S. feeds a culture of fear of Islam and describes  the United States as a good Christian nation (Powell 105). 
* A clear pattern of reporting had been detected that differentiates "terrorists who were Muslim with international ties and terrorists who were U.S. citizens with no clear international ties" (Powell 105). This was utilized to frame "war of Islam on the United States".
* "Muslim Americans are no longer ‘‘free’’ to practice and to name their religion without fear of prosecution, judgment, or connection to terrorism." (Powell 107)

Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|resulting from the September 11 attacks]], while others have associated it with the increased presence of [[Islam in the United States|Muslims]] in the [[Islamophobia in the United States|United States]], the [[European Union]] and other [[secular state|secular nations]].

===Favorable perceptions===
{{See also|Liberal Muslim movements|Cultural Muslim}}

In response to these perceptions, [[Ram Puniyani]], a [[secular]] activist and writer, says that "Islam does not condone violence but, like other religions, does believe in self-defence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times |first=Ram |last=Puniyani|publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Juergensmeyer]] describes the teachings of Islam as ambiguous about violence. He states that, like all religions, Islam occasionally allows for force while stressing that the main spiritual goal is one of nonviolence and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror in the mind of God: the global rise of religious violence |first=Mark |last=Juergensmeyer |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Qur%27an+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eUsMTZ37PIqcsQON5uCJCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Qur%27an%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ralph W. Hood]], Peter C. Hill and Bernard Spilka write in ''The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach'', "Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach|first1=Ralph W. |last1=Hood |first2=Peter C.|last2=Hill |first3=Bernard |last3=Spilka |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2009|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETVk59xbc90C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZbcFTb21G4uosAOp3ZiKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Chandra Muzaffar]], a [[political scientist]], [[Liberal Muslim movements#Reform|Islamic reformist]] and [[activist]], says, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rights, religion and reform: enhancing human dignity through spiritual and moral transformation |first=Chandra |last=Muzaffar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002|page=345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQA02NT6tmAC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Quran+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-C8HTdGqOoOusAPNn4DZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
[[Pew Research Center|Pew research]] in 2010 found that in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Nigeria]], roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of [[Hezbollah]], and that [[Hamas]] also saw similar support.&lt;ref name=PewDivided&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/|title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah|date=2 December 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-terrorism]] researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall |title=Researcher: Suicide terrorism linked to military occupation - Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[National Post]], [[Barbara Kay]] stated that [[honor killing]] is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including [[sexism]], dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by "Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[Continue calling ‘honour killings’ by its rightful name, Barbara Kay, September 21, 2011, Full comment, National Post.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center also found that support for the [[Islam and capital punishment|death penalty]] as punishment for "people who leave the Muslim religion" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries.&lt;ref name=PewDivided/&gt; The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.

Polls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/Muslim-Americans-No-Justification-Violence.aspx|title=Most Muslim Americans See No Justification for Violence|publisher=gallup.com|date=2 August 2011|author=Nicole Naurath|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/|title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East|publisher=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Esposito]] and [[Dalia Mogahed]] present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) &lt;ref name=GallupEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307065817/http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-07|title=FAQs: Who Speaks for Islam?|publisher=gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be "perfectly justified" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims "Politically Radicalized".&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt; They chose that title "because of their radical political orientation" and clarify "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=GallupRadical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104941/what-makes-radical.aspx|publisher=Gallup.com|title=What Makes a Radical?|author=Gallup Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.&lt;ref name=GallupRadical/&gt;

The authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims "Moderates". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks ''almost'' cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called "[[Political radicalism|Politically Radicalized]]". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt;

The '''ecological restoration of islands''', or '''island restoration''', is the application of the principles of [[ecological restoration]] to [[island]]s and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, as well as important breeding grounds for [[seabird]]s and some [[marine mammal]]s. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and particularly to [[introduced species]], due to their small size. Island groups such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]] have undergone substantial [[extinction]]s and losses of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species.

==Islands, endemism and extinction==
Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of [[Island biogeography]], formulated by  [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E.O. Wilson]] was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|New Zealand]]'s bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.

Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to [[predator]]s. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of [[island tameness|tameness]]. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that [[moa]]s were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the [[dodo]], are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the [[Pacific]] islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.

[[Image:Takahe and chick.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Takahe]] have bred after translocation to restored islands, like these on [[Kapiti Island]].]]
The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of [[Nonsuch Island]] in [[Bermuda]] (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on [[Cuvier Island]], where ecologists removed stock, [[goat]]s, [[feral cats]] and finally, in 1993, [[Pacific rat]]s. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the [[magenta petrel]], islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the [[takahe]], where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.

===Eradication of introduced alien species===
One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of [[invasive species|invasive alien species]]. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Islands Invasive Vertebrate Eradication Database: A tool to improve and facilitate restoration of island ecosystems.|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/croll/pdf/Keitt_2011.pdf|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors &amp; Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of [[Round Island (Mauritius)|Round Island]], in [[Mauritius]], all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a [[Judas goat]], where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.

Trapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is [[poison]]ing, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the [[Falkland Islands]], in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on [[Anacapa Island]] in the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] and Rat Island ([[Hawadax Island|Hawadax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seabirdrestoration.org/pdf/RatIslandReview.pdf|title=THE RAT ISLAND RAT ERADICATION PROJECT: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF NONTARGET MORTALITY.

In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land [[crab]]s instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.

The removal of invasive [[weed]]s is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of [[sandbur]], ''Cencrus echinatus'', an introduced [[grass]] on [[Laysan]]. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native [[bunchgrass]], and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the [[Laysan duck]] and [[Laysan finch]], as well as those of several [[seabird]]s.  The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.

====Strategies====

There are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication.
Exclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact.
Control has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.
Eradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levels&lt;ref&gt;Myers, J. H., Simberloff, D., Kuris, A.  M. &amp; Carey, J. R. (2000). Eradication revisited : dealing with exotic species. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 15, 316–320.&lt;/ref&gt; ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M. (2003). Mammal invaders on islands: impact, control and control impact. Cambridge Philosophical Society. 78, 347-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====

Fencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication.
Shooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly.
Trapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at.  This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture.

Poisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.&lt;ref name=tny20141223&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Kolbert|first1=Elizabeth |title=The Big Kill : New Zealand's crusade to rid itself of mammals |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/22/big-kill |accessdate=23 December 2014 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use.&lt;ref name=tny20141223/&gt;

Predator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Competitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well.
Virus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Restoration of former habitat===
In many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of [[endangered species]], where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.

One other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival.

==Opposition to island restoration==
Prior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the [[animal rights]] movement, which contends that the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in [[Kangaroo Island#Conservation|Kangaroo Island]] [[koala]]s.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well.  Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of [[hedgehog]] removal in the [[Outer Hebrides]] offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' trees from [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] faced considerable opposition.

==Island restoration projects==
Island restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects. A comprehensive list of projects can be found on the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIISE|url=http://diise.islandconservation.org/|publisher=Island Conservation|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Round Island ===
[[Île Ronde, Mauritius|Round Island]] (Île Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of [[Mauritius]], with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - In The Field - Mauritius - Round Island|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216936090|title=Lost land of the dodo : an ecological history of Mauritius, Réunion &amp; Rodrigues|last=S.)|first=Cheke, A. S. (Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Hume, Julian P. (Julian Pender)|isbn=9780300141863|location=New Haven|oclc=216936090}}&lt;/ref&gt; These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback mechanism]] that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, ''Latania loddigesii'', ''Pandanus vandermeerschii'' and ''Hyophorbe lagenicaulis'', which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were [[critically endangered]]) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks ''Leiolopisma telfaririi'' and ''Scelotes bojerii'', the geckos ''Phelsuma guentheri'', ''P. ornata'' and ''Nactus serpensinsula'', and the snake C''asarea dussumerii.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-01-01|title=Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius, following eradication of rabbits|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320794900043|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90004-3|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the [[Mauritian Wildlife Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=1&amp;tcid=1|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - Home|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/|title=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust {{!}} Home|website=Durrell|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. 

===Aleutian Islands===
[[Image:Fox with auklet.jpg|200px|thumb|Arctic fox with [[least auklet]].]]
The [[Aleutian Islands]], prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century [[Arctic fox]]es were introduced to act as a source for the [[fur trade]], a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly [[seabird]]s like the [[whiskered auklet]]. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the [[ecology]] of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003.

===Campbell Island===
[[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] is a sub [[Antarctic]] island 700&amp;nbsp;km south of New Zealand that became infested with [[Norway rat|rats]] in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the [[Campbell teal]] and [[Campbell snipe]], only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for [[ex-situ conservation]], but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of [[bird strike]] for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. [[Snipe]] have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.

=== South Georgia ===
Rats, brought to [[South Georgia Island]] as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28e%29Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|title=Eradication of Rodents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803043220/http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/(e)Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|archivedate=2015-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10518">A '''J curve''' is any of a variety of J-shaped diagrams where a curve initially falls, then steeply rises above the starting point.

==Balance of trade model==
{{one source|section|date=February 2013}}

In [[economics]], the 'J curve' is the time path of a country’s [[trade balance]] following a [[devaluation]] or [[depreciation]] of its currency, under a certain set of assumptions. A devalued [[currency]] means [[imports]] are more expensive, and on the assumption that the volumes of imports and exports change little at first, this causes a fall in the [[current account]] (a bigger [[Trade deficit|deficit]] or smaller surplus). After some time, though, the volume of exports may start to rise because of their lower and hence more competitive prices to foreign buyers, and domestic consumers may buy fewer of the costlier imports. Eventually, if this happens, the trade balance should move to a smaller deficit or larger surplus compared to what it was before the devaluation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Macroeconomics|last=Feenstra and Taylor|first=Robert and Alan|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4292-7843-0|location=New York,NY 10010|pages=261–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, if there is a [[currency revaluation]] or [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] the same reasoning may be applied and will lead to an inverted J curve.

Immediately following the depreciation or devaluation of the currency, the total value of imports will increase and exports remain largely unchanged due in part to pre-existing trade contracts that have to be honored. This is because in the short run, prices of imports rise due to the depreciation and also in the short run there is a lag in changing consumption of imports, therefore there is an immediate jump followed by a lag until the long run prevails and consumers stop importing as many expensive goods and along with the rise in exports cause the current account to increase (a smaller defect or a bigger surplus).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, in the short run, demand for the more expensive imports (and demand for exports, which are cheaper to foreign buyers using foreign currencies) remain price inelastic. This is due to time lags in the consumer's search for acceptable, cheaper alternatives (which might not exist).

Over the longer term a depreciation in the exchange rate can have the desired effect of improving the current account balance. Domestic consumers might switch their expenditure to domestic products and away from expensive imported goods and services, assuming equivalent domestic alternatives exist. Equally, many foreign consumers may switch to purchasing the products being exported into their country, which are now cheaper in the foreign currency, instead of their own domestically produced goods and services.

Empirical investigations of the J curve have sometimes focused on the effect of exchange rate changes on the trade ratio, i.e. exports divided by imports, rather than the trade balance, exports minus imports. Unlike the trade balance, the trade ratio can be [[logarithm|logarithmically transformed]] regardless of whether a trade deficit or trade surplus exists.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, RS and Hatemi-J, A. (2004)  [url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/etrans/v12y2004i4p777-799.html  The effect of exchange rate changes on trade balances in the short and long run: Evidence from German trade with transitional Central European Economies. Economics of Transition. 12(4) 777-799.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private equity==
[[Image:The J-Curve PE.png|thumb|400px|right|An illustration of the J curve in Private Equity]]
In [[private equity]], the J curve is used to illustrate the historical tendency of [[private equity fund]]s to deliver negative returns in early years and investment gains in the outlying years as the portfolios of companies mature.&lt;ref&gt;Grabenwarter, Ulrich. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=AxgjxW4ij6EC&amp;dq Exposed to the J-Curve: Understanding and Managing Private Equity Fund Investments], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.com/features/arc/2006/nz8397.php A discussion on the J-Curve in private equity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612054840/http://www.altassets.com/features/arc/2006/nz8397.php |date=2013-06-12 }}. [[AltAssets]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the fund, a number of factors contribute to negative returns including management fees, investment costs and under-performing investments that are identified early and written down. Over time the fund will begin to experience unrealized gains followed eventually by events in which gains are realized (e.g., [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], [[leveraged recapitalization]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=/investments/assets/equities/aim/private-equity-review/understanding.xml Understanding Private Equity Performance: The J-CURVE Effect: Earning Acceptable Returns Takes Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027053841/http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=%2Finvestments%2Fassets%2Fequities%2Faim%2Fprivate-equity-review%2Funderstanding.xml |date=2008-10-27 }}.  California Public Employees' Retirement System&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the J curve effect has been more pronounced in the US, where private equity firms tend to carry their investments at the lower of market value or investment cost and have been more aggressive in writing down investments than in writing up investments.  As a result, the carrying value of any investment that is underperforming will be written down but the carrying value of investments that are performing well tend to be recognized only when there is some kind of event that forces the [[private equity firm]] to mark up the investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carriedinterest.com/2006/02/weekly_private__2.html J-Curve Effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

The steeper the positive part of the J curve, the quicker cash is returned to investors. A private equity firm that can make quick returns to investors provides investors with the opportunity to reinvest that cash elsewhere.  Of course, with a tightening of credit markets, private equity firms have found it harder to sell businesses they previously invested in. Proceeds to investors have reduced. J curves have flattened dramatically.  This leaves investors with less cash flow to invest elsewhere, such as in other private equity firms. The implications for private equity could well be severe. Being unable to sell businesses to generate proceeds and fees means some in the industry have predicted consolidation amongst private equity firms.{{Citation needed|reason=J Curves have not flatted since 2007|date=December 2017}}

==Country status model==
{{main|The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall}}
[[Image:The-J-Curve blanksm.jpg|right]] Another 'J curve' refers to the correlation between stability and openness. This theory was suggested initially by the author [[Ian Bremmer]], in his book ''The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall''.

The x-axis of the political J curve graph measures the 'openness' of the economy in question and the y-axis measures the stability of that same state. It suggests that those states that are 'closed'/undemocratic/unfree (such as the Communist dictatorships of [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]]) are very stable; however, as one progresses right, along the x-axis, it is evident that stability (for relatively short period of time in the lengthy life of nations) decreases, creating a dip in the graph, until beginning to pick up again as the 'openness' of a state increases; at the other end of the graph to closed states are the open states of [[Western world|the West]], such as the [[United States of America]] or the [[United Kingdom]]. Thus, a J-shaped curve is formed.

States can travel both forward (right) and backwards (left) along this J curve, and so stability and openness are never secure. The J is steeper on the left hand side, as it is easier for a leader in a failed state to create stability by closing the country than to build a civil society and establish accountable institutions; the curve is higher on the far right than left because states that prevail in opening their societies ([[Eastern Europe]], for example) ultimately become more stable than authoritarian regimes.

Bremmer's entire curve can shift up or down depending on economic resources available to the government in question.  So [[Saudi Arabia]]'s relative stability at every point along the curve rises or falls depending on the price of oil; [[China]]'s curve analogously depends on the country's economic growth.

==Medicine==
In medicine, the 'J curve' refers to a graph in which the x-axis measures either of two treatable symptoms (blood pressure or blood cholesterol level) while the y-axis measures the chance that a patient will develop cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is well known that high blood pressure or high cholesterol  levels increase a patient's risk. What is less well known is that plots of large populations against CVD mortality often take the shape of a J curve which indicates that patients with very low blood pressure and/or low cholesterol levels are also at increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4625 J-Curve Phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political science (model of revolutions)==
In [[political science]], the 'J curve' is part of a model developed by [[James Chowning Davies]] to explain political [[revolution]]s. Davies asserts that revolutions are a subjective response to a sudden reversal in fortunes after a long period of economic growth, which is known as relative deprivation.  Relative deprivation theory claims that frustrated expectations help overcome the [[collective action problem]], which in this case may breed revolt. Frustrated expectations could result from several factors, including growing levels of inequality within a country, which may mean those who are increasingly poor relative to the rich are getting less than they expected, or a period of sustained economic development, lifting general expectations, followed by a crisis.

This model is often applied to explain social unrest and efforts by governments to contain this unrest. This is referred to as the Davies' J curve, because economic development followed by a depression would be modeled as an upside down and slightly skewed J.

'''Otto Karl Wiesenburg''' was a Mississippi statesmen, lawyer, public servant, and resident of Pascagoula, Mississippi.  He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned home to help develop [[Jackson County, Mississippi]], into a thriving industrial complex.  Wiesenburg is best known for his opposition to Governor Ross Barnett's attempt to deny the enrollment of [[James Meredith]] into the University of Mississippi.&lt;ref name = "Rubin 2002"&gt;[[Richard Rubin (writer)|Rubin, Richard]] (2002). ''Confederacy of Silence: A True Tale of the New Old South, New York, New York: Atria Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-671-03666-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Otto Karl Wiesenburg''' was born in Rosedale, Long Island, New York on August 1, 1911 and attended public high school in New York City.  He arrived in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] in 1931 as a radio operator on a U.S. Coast Guard vessel and spent his life there working to improve the city, Jackson County, and the State of [[Mississippi]]. He served in the Coast Guard from December 3, 1929 to December 2, 1934 advancing from apprentice seaman to Radioman 2nd Class.   While he did not complete high school before leaving New York to join the Coast Guard, he was a self-educated man who studied law by reading law books during his days at sea in the Coast Guard.  In 1933, he passed the Mississippi bar examination, was admitted to the Mississippi Bar on March 27, 1933 and practiced law in Pascagoula until the day of his death on June 18, 1990. His law practice was one of the most respected in the state and he was described as a man of integrity by the ''Mississippi Press'' newspaper.

== Military Service ==

Although he had met his military obligation with five year's service in the Coast Guard, he joined the U.S. Army after [[Pearl Harbor]] on May 2, 1942 and served overseas for 42 months in World War II as a radio operator in India, Burma, and China rising to the rank of Captain. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and The Asiatic/Pacific Medal with two combat stars.  After the war, he continued his military service in the U. S. Army Reserve serving as commanding officer of the 845th Signal Service Battalion before retiring as a Lt. Colonel in 1964.

== Public Service ==

Devoted to public service, Wiesenburg was appointed to the Pascagoula Port Commission in 1941 and served as its president. He served as city attorney to both [[Pascagoula]] and Ocean Springs and as attorney for the Pascagoula Port Authority and attorney for the Jackson County Board of Supervisors.  He also served for one term on the Pascagoula City Council.  In 1956, he was elected to the [[Mississippi Legislature]] where served until 1964. He was voted the Outstanding Freshman Legislator in 1956. During his eight years, he authored significant legislation for south Mississippi including the County Zoning Act, State Ports Act, Water Safety and Boating Act, Pat Harrison Waterway Commission Act, and the Jackson County Campus - Mississippi Gulf Coast Jr. College Act. He also authored the landmark Jackson County Port Authority Act that created the port of Pascagoula, including the industrial area of Bayou Casotte.  The Jackson County Port Authority considers him the father of the Port of Pascagoula.

== Meredith Incident ==

During the period when [[James Meredith]] entered the University of Mississippi as its first black student, over the opposition of Governor [[Ross Barnett]] and the [[Mississippi Legislature]], Wiesenburg was one of two legislators, the other being Joe Wroten of Greenville, who took a strong stand for civil rights and observance of the law. Wiesenburg stated of the Barnett administration that, "His administration will go down as the worst since Reconstruction days." &lt;ref name = "Sitton 1962"&gt;[[Claude Sitton|Sitton, Claude]] (1962). Mississippi Votes New Laws to Keep University White, The New York Times, September 20, 1962, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a five-part series of articles titled "The Oxford Disaster...Price of Defiance" that was published in the Pascagoula newspaper ''The Chronicle'' between December 17–21, 1962.&lt;ref name = "Harkey 1967"&gt;[[Ira B. Harkey, Jr.|Harkey, Ira B. Jr.]] (1967). ''The Smell of Burning Crosses; An Autobiography of a Mississippi Newspaperman, Jacksonville, Illinois: Harris-Wolf &amp; Company. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The articles detailed the applicable federal and state laws that had been violated and stated that the Governor's action had followed "the road to riot" and that the resulting bloodshed in Oxford was the "price of defiance." [[Ira B. Harkey Jr.]] editor of ''The Chronicle'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] in 1963 for his anti-segregationist editorials and reporting of the [[James Meredith]] incident. Others also took notice of Wiesenburg's strong stand for the rule of law. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] wrote of Wiesenburg in a letter to the federal attorney in Oxford, "Tell [Wiesenburg] for me that he is the one who deserves a Pulitzer Prize or more.  It is all well for we in the North to talk about these matters. That takes no courage at all.  But people such as you and Mr. Wiesenburg are the ones who really carry the banner." &lt;ref name = "Schlesinger 1978"&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Schlesinger, Arthur M. Jr.]] (1978). Robert Kennedy and His Times, New York, New York: Balentine Books. p. 351. {{ISBN|0-345-28344-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Mississippi Governor [[William Winter (politician)|William Winter]] described Wiesenburg as "one of the most courageous men he ever knew."

While he did not attend college, unknown to his family until after his death, he paid for many students to attend colleges throughout the state.  His family has established the Karl Wiesenburg Scholarship at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] to honor his commitment to education and public service.  The scholarship is available to University of Southern Mississippi students majoring in political science with preference for a student from Jackson County.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6969">In mathematics, the '''Levi-Civita field''', named after [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], is a [[non-Archimedean ordered field]]; i.e., a system of numbers containing infinite and [[infinitesimal]] quantities. Each member &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed as a formal series of the form

: &lt;math&gt;
 a = \sum_{q\in\mathbb{Q}} a_q\varepsilon^q ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_q&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is to be interpreted as a positive infinitesimal.  The [[support (mathematics)|support]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the set of indices of the nonvanishing coefficients &lt;math&gt;\{q\in\mathbb{Q}:a_q\neq 0\},&lt;/math&gt; must be a left-finite set: for any member of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, there are only finitely many members of the set less than it; this restriction is necessary in order to make multiplication and division well defined and unique. The ordering is defined according to the dictionary ordering of the list of coefficients, which is equivalent to the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal.

The [[real number]]s are embedded in this field as series in which all of the coefficients vanish except &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* &lt;math&gt;7\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal that is greater than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, but less than every positive real number.
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2&lt;/math&gt; is less than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and is also less than &lt;math&gt;r\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any positive real &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; differs infinitesimally from 1.
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, but still less than every positive real number.
* &lt;math&gt;1/\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is greater than any real number.
* &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon+\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon^2+\cdots+\frac{1}{n!}\varepsilon^n+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;e^\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon + 2\varepsilon^2 + \cdots + n!\varepsilon^n + \cdots&lt;/math&gt; is a valid member of the field, because the series is to be construed formally, without any consideration of [[convergent series|convergence]].

==Definition of the field operations and positive cone==

If &lt;math&gt;f=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}f_q \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}g_q \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt; are two Levi-Civita series, then 
* their sum &lt;math&gt;f+g&lt;/math&gt; is the pointwise sum &lt;math&gt;f+g:=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}(f_q+g_q) \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt;.
* their product &lt;math&gt;fg&lt;/math&gt; is the Cauchy product &lt;math&gt;fg:=\sum \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}\sum \limits_{a+b=q}(f_ag_b) \varepsilon^q&lt;/math&gt;.
(One can check that the support of this series is left-finite and that for each of its elements &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\{(a,b) \in \mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}: \ a+b=q \wedge f_a \neq 0 \wedge g_b \neq 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so the product is well defined.)
* the relation &lt;math&gt;0&lt;f&lt;/math&gt; holds if &lt;math&gt;f\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has non-empty support) and the least non-zero coefficient of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly positive.

Equipped with those operations and order, the Levi-Civita field is indeed an ordered field extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where the series &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a positive infinitesimal.

==Properties and applications==
The Levi-Civita field is [[real-closed field|real-closed]], meaning that it can be [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] by adjoining an [[imaginary unit]] (''i''), or by letting the coefficients be [[complex number|complex]]. It is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented using [[floating point]]. 
It is the basis of [[automatic differentiation]], a way to perform differentiation in cases that are intractable by symbolic differentiation or finite-difference methods.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, Martin Berz "[http://www2.physics.umanitoba.ca/u/khodr/Publications/RS-Overview-offprints.pdf Analysis on the Levi-Civita Field: A Brief Overview]", ''Contemporary Mathematics'', '''508''' pp 215-237 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Levi-Civita field is also [[Cauchy complete]], meaning that relativizing the &lt;math&gt;\forall \exists\forall&lt;/math&gt; definitions of Cauchy sequence and convergent sequence to sequences of Levi-Civita series, each Cauchy sequence in the field converges. Equivalently, it has no proper dense ordered field extension.

As an ordered field, it has a natural [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] given by the rational exponent corresponding to the first non zero coefficient of a Levi-Civita series. The valuation ring is that of series bounded by real numbers, the residue field is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and the value group is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Q},+)&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting valued field is [[Henselian]] (being real closed with a convex valuation ring) but not [[spherically complete]]. Indeed, the field of [[Hahn series]] with real coefficients and value group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Q},+)&lt;/math&gt; is a proper immediate extension, containing series such as &lt;math&gt;1+\varepsilon^{1/2}+\varepsilon^{2/3}+\varepsilon^{3/4}+\varepsilon^{4/5}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; which are not in the Levi-Civita field.

==Relations to other ordered fields==

The Levi-Civita field is the Cauchy-completion of the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; of [[Puiseux series]] over the field of real numbers, that is, it is a dense extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; without proper dense extension. Here is a list of some of its notable proper subfields and its proper ordered field extensions:

===Notable subfields===
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; of fractions of real polynomials with infinitesimal positive indeterminate &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}((\varepsilon))&lt;/math&gt; of [[Formal power series#Formal Laurent series|formal Laurent series]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; of Puiseux series over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Notable extensions===
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[[\varepsilon^{\mathbb{Q}}]]&lt;/math&gt; of Hahn series with real coefficients and rational exponents.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; of [[transseries|logarithmic-exponential transseries]].
* The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}(\varepsilon_0)&lt;/math&gt; of [[surreal numbers]] with birthdate below the first [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-number]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Fields of hyperreal numbers constructed as ultrapowers of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; modulo a free ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; (although here the embeddings are not canonical).

'''Malaise''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|z}} {{respell|mə|LAYZ}}) is a feeling of general [[suffering|discomfort]], uneasiness or pain, often the first indication of an [[infection]] or other disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003089.htm|title=Malaise: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|author=|date=|website=medlineplus.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916154928/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003089.htm|archivedate=2016-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/well|title=Well|author=|date=|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424040459/https://www.nytimes.com/section/well|archivedate=2018-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has existed in the French language since at least the 12th century.

The term is also often used figuratively in other contexts; for example, "[[economic malaise]]" refers to an economy that is stagnant or in recession (compare [[Depression (economics)|depression]]). The term is particularly associated with the US [[1973–75 recession]].&lt;ref&gt;One example can be found in ''The Next 200 Years: A Scenario for America and the World'', by [[Herman Kahn]] et al., published in 1976, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A speech made by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1979 is commonly referred to as the [[Malaise speech|"malaise" speech]], although the term was not in the speech.

== Cause ==
Malaise is a [[non-specific symptom]] and can be present in the slightest ailment, such as an [[emotion]] (causing fainting, a [[vasovagal response]]) or hunger (light [[hypoglycemia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/2/390|title=Short-Term, Delayed, and Working Memory Are Impaired During Hypoglycemia in Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes|first1=Andrew J.|last1=Sommerfield|first2=Ian J.|last2=Deary|first3=Vincent|last3=McAulay|first4=Brian M.|last4=Frier|date=1 February 2003|publisher=|journal=Diabetes Care|volume=26|issue=2|pages=390–396|via=care.diabetesjournals.org|doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2.390|pmid=12547868|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913150624/http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/2/390|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), to the most serious conditions ([[cancer]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], [[internal bleeding]], etc.).

Malaise expresses a patient's uneasiness that "something is not right" that may need a medical examination to determine the significance.

Malaise is thought to be caused by the activation of an immune response, and the associated pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dantzer|first1=Robert|title=Cytokine, Sickness Behavior, and Depression|journal=Immunology and allergy clinics of North America|date=1 December 2016|volume=29|issue=2|pages=247–264|doi=10.1016/j.iac.2009.02.002|pmc=2740752|issn=0889-8561|pmid=19389580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Masculism sidebar|persons}}

'''Michael Alan Messner''' (born 1952) is an American [[sociologist]]. His main areas of research are [[gender]] (especially [[men's studies]]) and the [[sociology of sports]]. He is the author of several books, he gives public speeches and teaches on issues of [[gender-based violence]], the lives of men and boys, and gender and sports.

Since 1987, Messner has worked as a professor of sociology and [[gender studies]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  He was head of the department, and still retains his dual faculty appointment. He was the president of the Pacific Sociological Association in 2010-2011, and in 2011 the California Women's Law Center presented him with the Pursuit of Justice Award.

==Biography==
Messner was born in [[Salinas, California]].

===Education===
Messner was educated from kindergarten to his [[Ph.D.]] in California's [[state school|public schools]]. He has a bachelor's degree in [[social science]] and a master's degree in sociology from  [[California State University, Chico]]. He obtained a Ph.D. in sociology in 1985 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a dissertation titled ''[[Masculinity]] and Sports: An Exploration of the Changing Meaning of Male Identity in the [[Life course approach|Lifecourse]] of the Athlete''.

In the late 1970s, he started to deal with [[feminist theory]] and the construction of gender. He took part in one of the first ever classes about men and masculinity in the USA, held by [[Bob Blauner]] in Berkeley.

===Personal life===
Messner lives in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] with his wife, [[Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo]] (a sociologist and author).  They have two sons, named Miles and Sasha.

==Views==

===Comments regarding "fight clubs"===
In an article about a "fight club" in [[Menlo Park, California]], Messner remarked that men involved in them "often carry bottled-up violent impulses learned in childhood from [[Video game controversy|video games]], [[Violence in cartoons|cartoons]] and [[Combat in film|movies]]. [...] Boys have these warrior [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] [[Aestheticization of violence|picked up from popular culture]], and schools sort of force that out of them."  In these fantasies: "The good guys always resort to violence, and they always get the [[Recognition (sociology)|glory]] and the women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Robertson | first = Jordon |title=The first rule of Silicon Valley fight club is... |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13037439/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/ |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |work=[[MSNBC]] |date=29 May 2006 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality and Gender Roles===
Messner establishes the emphasis society puts on sexuality and gender roles in various works upholding the notions that roles in society are predetermined by these categorizations. Gender role is the set of characteristics prescribed by a culture and expressed through direct communication and through media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wood | first1 = Julia T. | last2 = Fixmer-Oraiz | first2 = Natalie  | title = Gendered lives: communication, gender, &amp; culture | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 2015 | edition = 12th | isbn = 9781305280274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These predetermined roles can lead to inequivalent advantages to people classified in certain categories over others. In many societies, this has become a systematic oppression. He discusses these ideas through various articles and explores different topics such as the participation of women in sports as well as what it means to be 100% straight.

Messner upholds the theory that sexuality is, "a constructed identity, a performance, and an institution".&lt;ref name="Messner_100%"&gt;{{cite book | last = Messner | first = Michael | chapter = Becoming 100 percent straight | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ycaEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 | editor-last1 = Coakley | editor-first1 = Jay | editor-last2 = Donnelly | editor-first2 = Peter | title = Inside sports | pages = 97&amp;ndash;103 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415170895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} It is not necessary and it influences behaviors in society every day. He discusses this idea in depth in his article, "Becoming 100 percent Straight". In this article, he discusses how he as a teenager was influenced to become a jock because of his height and build and, as a result,  repressed his sexual fluidity in fear of being outcast. He talks about his experience with basketball and his relationship with his friend because of his repressed romantic feelings for him. As a result of these feelings, he targets him as an external source of his frustrations and even goes as far as bullying him to express these frustrations. Although Messner does not identify as bisexual, he describes his experiences based on the Freudian model of bisexuality which states that most people go through a stage in life in which they are attracted to people of the same sex. Adult experiences eventually lead them to shift their sexual desires to people of the same sex.&lt;ref name="Messner_100%" /&gt;{{rp|100}} This suppression of sexual desires can lead to aggression and violence in order to clarify boundaries between one's self and others. His experience serves as an example of a new perspective on sexuality that others in dominant gender/sexuality categories can identify with: one that is not dominated by socially constructed values.

Along with sexuality, Messner views gender to be a determining factor of the roles we exhibit in society. The world of sports is a prime example of the inherent differences that are constructed for different genders. Sports are a terrain of contested gender relations to Messner. Before the 1970s, girls did not feel as if they belonged in the sporting world because they were not made for it. However, Title IX passed in the early 70's gave them the equal opportunity to pursue sports in school. The participation in sports by women has a strong correlation with the presence of women in the workplace. While the participation of women in sports is a triumph in a movement toward equality, the sports world is still inherently different for women and men. It is fueled by "soft-essentialism", Messner's theory of the shared belief that boys and girls are inherently different as opposed to "hard essentialism," which basically creates a more categorical structure for men. Men are pushed to be more competitive than women through this notion of hard essentialism leading them to be driven by a linear notion that success and leadership in the workplace is the ultimate goal. Women, however, are routed towards sports like softball or even in different leagues altogether giving them choices and complicating the meaning of equality. He argues that separate can never truly be equal because of these components. This furthers the frame of mind that women and men are inherently different, and girls should not be where the boys are.

While integration of sports sound like an opportunity for equality, this idea of merging boys and girls together in youth sports would be potentially counterproductive. Sexists attitudes and presumptions develop in either scenario; if sports become coed, girls may be seen as disadvantaged, but if sports stay segregated the theory of soft essentialism can only help but run up against the social barriers of equal choice for women today.&lt;ref name="Gender Ideologies"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | title = Gender ideologies, youth sports, and the production of soft essentialism | journal = [[Sociology of Sport Journal]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 151&amp;ndash;170 | publisher = Human Kinetics Publishers | doi = 10.1123/ssj.28.2.151 | date = June 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1123/ssj.28.2.151 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/01_ssj_Messner_2010_0066.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} In order to dismantle the notion of soft essentialism, a coupled strategy of de-gendering boys sports along with a strategic categorization of women's sports can help break down gender based inequalities exhibited in society.

Gender also plays a key role in the development of gifted students. Gender identities in gifted students usually differ from those of their peers. For example, gifted girls are more like gifted boys than other girls. This complicates the development of their gender identity. Girls are more likely to underachieve because of stereotypes such as, "girls are bad at math" even though the math gap has shrunk significantly where the discrepancy between boys and girls used to be extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling &amp; Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 183&amp;ndash;191 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} For this reason it is important for counselors to be practiced in understanding gender educational practices and support students.

Sports and education provide a look at the inequalities found based on gender in boys and girls, but it does not paint the picture of gender and sexuality relations in society as a whole. Messner's views of gender predetermining roles in society is seen in extreme ways when looking at other cultures such as the Congolese. For example, when Moore wrote of her experiences in the Congo with women's rights, she found disturbing evidence that women were only used to birth children. When a women's workshop was held demonstrating that it is wrong for a husband to beat his wife, one man asked, "But if we can't beat our wives what can we do when they won't have sex with us?"&lt;ref name="Reding_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reding | first1 = Andrew | last2 = et al | title = The big question: How do sex and sexuality affect one's role in society? | journal = [[World Policy Journal]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;8 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | doi = 10.1177/0740277514529710 | date = 1 March 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0740277514529710 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273660763_The_Big_Question_How_do_sex_and_sexuality_affect_one%27s_role_in_society Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} This shows a universal, somewhat exaggerated, example of how women are seen in society, as childbearers. [[Male entitlement]] to women's bodies has become a standard in societies such as these and reflects the values that feminists like Messner aim to change.

Sexuality is a powerful tool used to control nations especially when it is paired with orthodox religious thinking. Feki states, "If you want to understand a people, look in their bedrooms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = El Feki | first = Shereen | chapter = Introduction |chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JLvEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR18 | editor-last = El Feki | editor-first = Shereen | title = Sex and the citadel: intimate life in a changing arab world | publisher = Vintage | page = xviii | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780099526384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hypothesis is correct when looking at societies such as Egypt. Governments and parents do not trust their children enough to learn about sex education. As a result, religious views of sexuality are established and followed strictly. Women are expected to remain virgins until marriage and chastity thereafter even though their sexuality is a family matter, usually determined by the patriarch on when and who she weds. It is this thinking that has kept women from leadership positions in the workplace and in politics. If women are not deemed responsible enough to control their own bodies, they will not be deemed capable of leading in any aspect.&lt;ref name="Reding_2014" /&gt;{{rp|5}} This affirms Messner's belief that roles in society are determined by one's gender and sexuality.

Messner examines gender and sexuality and concludes that they play an important role in determining one's place in society. They can shape the way people behave and develop and can mold views and actions to fit society's standards. It is fueled by notion that women and men are inherently different, a term Messner coins as soft essentialism. This theory often leads to sexuality and gender used as tools of oppression in some cultures which leads to views of women as sexual objects for men who do not have control of their bodies. Religion is sometimes paired with this theory to further the old hegemonic patriarchies established in emerging democracies such as Egypt. Changing the frame of mind of what sexuality and gender truly mean in society will help take steps towards equality. Equal opportunity for people of differing genders and sexuality can only benefit a society. For example, countries such as Germany, Denmark, and Norway have the closest gender gap in the workplace and they have some of the most powerful economies because of it according to Reding who states, "Humans are distinguished in their contributions to society by character, ability, and motivation, and there is no meaningful correlation between those traits and sex and sexuality".&lt;ref name="Reding_2014" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

===Title IX===
Messner has spoken out as a strong advocate for [[Title IX]]. Having interests in both gender studies and sports, he has analyzed it both from a feminist and sports perspective. Published in the ''[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]],'' his article "Social justice and Men's Interests: The Case of Title IX" reviews the effect [[Title IX]] has on men's interest in sports. He argues that although "men's superordinate status sets the stage for them to understand their interests as opposed to those of women",&lt;ref name="Social Justice"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Messner | first1 = Michael A. | last2 = Solomon | first2 = Nancy M. | title = Social justice and men's interests: the case of Title IX | journal = [[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 162&amp;ndash;178  | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0193723507301048 | date = May 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723507301048 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/title-IX.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; men gain much from integration of women into sports. He states that "these kinds of experiences can provide a commitment for men to take action with girls, women, and other men who are interested in building a more equitable and just world".&lt;ref name="Social Justice"/&gt; Overall, Messner believes that only through integration and mutual respect in all institutions (particularly sport) can we begin to grow relationships between men and women that allow for a better future for both parties.

==Research==
Messner has conducted research in several subcategories of [[Sociology]] over four decades.  Primarily, his research was influenced by several events that took place in the mid 20th century. He states in his online biography: "My teaching and research were sparked and continue to be animated by the movements for social justice that erupted in the 1960s, 1970s and beyond, especially [[feminism]]".&lt;ref name="Michael Messner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Messner|first1=Michael|title=Home page |url=http://www.michaelmessner.org|website=Michael Messner|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messner's research can be broken up into three main categories: gender and sport; sports media; and men, [[feminism]] and politics.

===Gender and Sport===
Messner has written four books and over eleven articles on gender and sport.&lt;ref name="Michael Messner"/&gt; His main article contributions have been to the ''[[Sociology of Sport Journal]]'', ''[[Gender &amp; Society]]'', and other scholarly journals. His website features many of these articles.

====Soft Essentialism====
In his paper, "Gender ideologies, youth sports, and the production of soft essentialism" Messner introduces the concept of soft essentialism as "a currently ascendant hegemonic ideology… that valorizes the liberal feminist ideal of individual choice for girls, while retaining a largely naturalized view of boys and men".&lt;ref name="Gender Ideologies" /&gt; He argues that essentially, especially in youth sports, we assume natural differences between boys and girls. However, by offering girls equal opportunity, soft essentialism does not "endorse categorical social containment of women in domestic life".&lt;ref name="Gender Ideologies"/&gt; While this type of thought is less restrictive for girls and women than hard essentialism, because it still uses institutions (particularly sport) to reinforce a "natural difference" between boys and girls, it is still counterproductive to the [[feminism]] movement as a whole.
Through extensive research and interviewing of youth soccer, baseball, and softball coaches about boys, girls, and gender, Messner found that most adults had a tendency to describe girls' lives as being full of choices – a way of thinking that Messner argues is a major accomplishment of liberal [[feminism]]. However, he found that when asked about boys, the responses were less sophisticated and assumed that boys were simply driven by testosterone. In his conclusion, Messner determines that there exist three main sources of strain that proliferate hegemonic gender inequality in the form of soft essentialism: working class mothers, today's largely unreconstructed and categorical view of boys, and the celebration of equal opportunity and free choice for girls. He argues that strategic categoricalism in girls' sports coupled with a de-gendering of boys' sports.

===Sports Media===
Messner has conducted research in sports media for over twenty years, focusing on what it covers and ignores. On his website he breaks his research down into three main areas: "First, [he] has conducted a longitudinal content and textual analysis of gender in televised news and highlights programs. Second, [he] is interested in how the sports media handles a particular story, especially a "scandal." Third, [he] is interested in the dominant gendered messages that are pitched to boys and men as consumers through sport broadcasts".&lt;ref name="Michael Messner"/&gt; Overall, Messner believes that sports media is yet another institution that promotes patriarchal sexist ideology.

Most of Messner's research in sports media revolves around the way the media portrays females and female athletes. In his most recent article on sports media, "Women Play Sport, But Not on TV: A Longitudinal Study of Televised News Media" he and co-authors Cheryl Cooky and Robin Hextrum analyze 6 weeks of local and national news coverage. Their evidence found that despite "tremendous increased participation of girls and women in sport at the high school, collegiate, and professional level," coverage of women's sport on television is "the lowest ever".&lt;ref name="Women Play Sport"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Messner | first1 = Michael A. | last2 = Cooky | first2 = Cheryl | last3 = Hextrum | first3 = Robin H. | title = Women play sport, but not on TV: a longitudinal study of televised news media | journal = Communication &amp; Sport | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 203&amp;ndash;230 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/2167479513476947 | date = September 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/2167479513476947 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cooky_Messner.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Through their research, Messner, Cooky, and Hextrum determined that sports media doesn't simply show what people want to see, but rather proliferates hegemonic gender asymmetries by contributing to a specific reception of sport that idealizes it as a man's world.

===Men and Feminism===
In his research on both men and women's studies, Messner has analyzed the feminist movement from a male perspective since the 1970s. His research particularly focuses on men's personal, organizational and political responses to [[feminism]]. His most recent contribution to [[feminism]] is his co-authored book, ''Some Men: Feminist Allies and the Movement to End Violence Against Women'', which was released in March 2015 through the Oxford University Press. As a general trend, Messner believes that it is in the best interest of men to support the feminist movement and the end of sexism.
In his 2004 article "On Patriarchs and Losers: Rethinking Men's Interests", Messner explores the concept of "men's interests', deciding whether or not there exists a universal interest for men and how that plays into the role of [[feminism]] in the United States. Furthermore, he discusses the development of the scholarly focus on "men and masculinity", observing exactly how men's interests in the United States are being articulated both in commercial and political discourse. Messner believes that all men must be on board with [[feminism]]. In particular, he points out an example with a young white guy speeding by in a pick-up truck with a gun rack. He writes, "I want that guy in the men's movement… and to get him involved, we have to convince him that the masculinity he has learned is self-destructive and toxic, and that feminist change is in his interest".&lt;ref name="Patriarchs and Losers"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | title = On patriarchs and losers: rethinking men's interests | journal = Berkeley Journal of Sociology | volume = 48 | pages = 74&amp;ndash;88 | publisher = [[Regents of the University of California]] | date = 2004 | jstor = 41035593 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BJS04.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Messner argues that, at its core, [[feminism]] is in the best interest of every person because systemic, hegemonic oppression harms everyone, not just women.

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goodman's construction and use of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in [[analytic philosophy|conceptual analysis]].

==Grue and bleen defined==
Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21278">The '''nothing to hide argument''' states that government [[surveillance]] programs do not threaten [[privacy]] unless they uncover illegal activities, and that if they do uncover illegal activities, the person committing these activities does not have the right to keep them private. Hence, a person who favors this argument may state "I've got nothing to hide" and therefore does not express opposition to government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rncAXAFD1jcC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3ynJUa6xGJLy9gSVmoDYAw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy%20%22nothing%20to%20hide%22%20argument&amp;f=false 252].&lt;/ref&gt; An individual using this argument may say that a person should not worry about government or surveillance if he/she has "nothing to hide."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove]], ''Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aaJdKX8avUAC&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument&amp;q=%22you+shouldn%27t+worry+about+government+surveillance%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22you%20shouldn%27t%20worry%20about%20government%20surveillance%22&amp;f=false 1]. "If you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about government surveillance."&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto "If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear" has been used in the [[closed-circuit television]] program practiced in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="SoloveChronHighWhyPriv" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
This argument is commonly used in discussions regarding [[privacy]]. [[Geoffrey Stone]], a legal scholar, said that the use of the argument is "all-too-common".&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv&gt;[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove, Daniel J]]. "[https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/ Why Privacy Matters Even if You Have 'Nothing to Hide']." ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. May 15, 2011. Retrieved on June 25, 2013. "The nothing-to-hide argument pervades discussions about privacy. The [[data security]] expert Bruce Schneier calls it the "most common retort against privacy advocates." The legal scholar Geoffrey Stone refers to it as an "all-too-common refrain." In its most compelling form, it is an argument that the privacy interest is generally minimal, thus making the contest with security concerns a foreordained victory for security."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Schneier]], a data security expert and [[Cryptography|cryptographer]], described it as the "most common retort against privacy advocates."&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv/&gt; Colin J. Bennett, author of ''The Privacy Advocates'', said that an advocate of privacy often "has to constantly refute" the argument.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEPrhAtk7wC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=%22nothing+to+hide%22+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LXLUdrFNoeK9QSgp4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;f=false 97].&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett explained that most people "go through their daily lives believing that surveillance processes are not directed at them, but at the miscreants and wrongdoers" and that "the dominant orientation is that mechanisms of surveillance are directed at others" despite "evidence that the monitoring of individual behavior has become routine and everyday".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEPrhAtk7wC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=%22nothing+to+hide%22+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LXLUdrFNoeK9QSgp4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;f=false 97]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEPrhAtk7wC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22the+dominant+orientation+is+that+mechanisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CPXLUa2-CJD49gTt24GAAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20dominant%20orientation%20is%20that%20mechanisms%22&amp;f=false 98].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnography==
An ethnographic study by Ana Viseu, Andrew Clement, and Jane Aspinal of the integration of online services into everyday life was published as "Situating Privacy Online: Complex Perceptions and Everyday Practices" in the ''[[Information, Communication &amp; Society]]'' journal in 2004. It found that, in the words of Kirsty Best, author of "Living in the control society: Surveillance, users and digital screen technologies", "fully employed, middle to middle-upper income earners articulated similar beliefs about not being targeted for surveillance" compared to other respondents who did not show concern, and that "In these cases, respondents expressed the view that they were not doing anything wrong, or that they had nothing to hide."&lt;ref name=Bestp12&gt;Best, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the participant sample in Viseu's study, one reported using privacy-enhancing technology,&lt;ref&gt;Viseu, et al. p. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; and Viseu et al. said "One of the clearest features of our subjects’ privacy perceptions and practices was their passivity towards the issue."&lt;ref&gt;Viseu, et al. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Viseu et al. said the passivity originated from the "nothing to hide" argument.&lt;ref name=Viseup103&gt;Viseu, et al. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a qualitative study conducted for the [[government of the United Kingdom]] around 2003,&lt;ref name="OECDp323"&gt;OECD, "Appendix II: Can We Be Persuaded to Become Pet-Lovers?&lt;!--(PET means "privacy-enhancing technologies)--&gt;" p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXGYFJ6ANgC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=%22In+a+recent+qualitative+study+conducted+for+the+UK+government%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qx7OUaOZF4rm8wTSooDADQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20a%20recent%20qualitative%20study%20conducted%20for%20the%20UK%20government%22&amp;f=false 323].&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Perri 6{{sic}}&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "Appendix II: Can We Be Persuaded to Become Pet-Lovers?&lt;!--(PET means "privacy-enhancing technologies)--&gt;" p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXGYFJ6ANgC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=%22This+study+was+prepared+by+Dr.+Perri%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCDOUcmoIZLM9gTkkYDIBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22This%20study%20was%20prepared%20by%20Dr.%20Perri%22&amp;f=false 305]&lt;/ref&gt; presented four outlooks on privacy risks with a mapping of eight frames to show privacy attitude distributions.&lt;ref name=OECDp323/&gt; According to the study, men who were self-employed initially used the "nothing to hide" argument before shifting to an argument in which they perceived surveillance to be a nuisance instead of a threat.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "Appendix II: Can We Be Persuaded to Become Pet-Lovers?&lt;!--(PET means "privacy-enhancing technologies)--&gt;"  p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXGYFJ6ANgC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=%22nothing+to+hide%22+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BXOUdPPIoLY9QS03oA4&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brokers%20in%20networks%22&amp;f=false 326]. "The self-employed males, by contrast, who operated as brokers in networks; might sometimes begin with the "nothing to hide" frame, in which they would claim that no one with anything to hide need be concerned about privacy at all, but quickly shifted to the "inconvenience" frame, in which data collection and sharing was seen more as a nuisance than as a threat."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on privacy protection==
Viseu, et al. said that the argument "has been well documented in the privacy literature as a stumbling block to the development of pragmatic [[privacy protection]] strategies, and it, too, is related to the ambiguous and symbolic nature of the term ‘privacy’ itself."&lt;ref name=Viseup103/&gt; They explained that privacy is an abstract concept and people only become concerned with it once their privacy is gone, and they compare a loss to privacy with people knowing that [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] are negative developments but that "the immediate gains of driving the car to work or putting on hairspray outweigh the often invisible losses of [[pollution|polluting]] the environment."&lt;ref name=Viseup103/&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}

===For privacy===
[[Edward Snowden]]: "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about [[free speech]] because you have nothing to say." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/|title=Just days left to kill mass surveillance under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. We are Edward Snowden and the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer. AUA. • /r/IAmA|website=reddit|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/11/edward-snowden-new-yorker-festival/|title=Edward Snowden’s Privacy Tips: "Get Rid Of Dropbox," Avoid Facebook And Google|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel J. Solove]] stated in an article for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors.&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv/&gt; Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government [[data collection]] and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv/&gt;

[[Danah Boyd]], a social media researcher, opposes the argument. She said that even though "[p]eople often feel immune from state surveillance because they’ve done nothing wrong" an entity or group can distort a person's image and harm one's reputation, or [[guilt by association]] can be used to defame a person.&lt;ref&gt;[[danah boyd|boyd, danah]]&lt;!--Intentionally uncapitalized--&gt;. "[http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/sunday-commentary/20130614-danah-boyd-the-problem-with-the-i-have-nothing-to-hide-argument.ece Danah Boyd&lt;!--I's capitalized in the DMN article--&gt;: The problem with the ‘I have nothing to hide’ argument]." (Opinion) ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. June 14, 2013. Retrieved on June 25, 2013. "It’s disturbing to me how often I watch as someone’s likeness is constructed in ways[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam D. Moore]], author of ''Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations'', argued "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security."&lt;ref name=Moorep204&gt;Moore, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AEn0J0Drx9MC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22tHE+DISTribution+aspect+is+highlighted+when+surveillance+targets%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NvLLUcSJEIj68QTF04HIBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tHE%20DISTribution%20aspect%20is%20highlighted%20when%20surveillance%20targets%22&amp;f=false 204].&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, and religion.&lt;ref name=Moorep204/&gt;  Moore maintains that there are at least three other problems with the "nothing to hide" argument.  First, if individuals have [[privacy rights]], then invoking "nothing to hide" is irrelevant.  Privacy, understood as a right to control access to and uses of spaces, locations, and personal information, means that it is the right holder who determines access.  To drive this point home Moore offers the following case.  "Imagine upon exiting your house one day you find a person searching through your trash painstakingly putting the shredded notes and documents back together.  In response to your stunned silence he proclaims 'you don’t have anything to worry about – there is no reason to hide, is there?'" &lt;ref name="Moorep204"/&gt; Second, individuals may wish to hide embarrassing behavior or conduct not accepted by the dominant culture.  "Consider someone’s sexual or [[medical history]]. Imagine someone visiting a library to learn about alternative lifestyles not accepted by the majority." &lt;ref name="Moorep204"/&gt; Finally, Moore argues that "nothing to hide," if taken seriously, could be used against government agents, politicians, and CEO's.  This is to turn the “nothing to hide” argument on its head.  Moore argues that the [[NSA]] agent, politician, police chief, and CEO have nothing to hide so they should embrace total transparency like the rest of us.  "But they don’t and when given the technological tools to watch, the politician, police chief, or CEO are almost always convinced that watching others is a good thing." &lt;ref name="Moorep204"/&gt;

[[Bruce Schneier]], a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or [[blackmail]] that individual.&lt;ref name="SchneierEternal"&gt;[[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]]. "[https://www.schneier.com/essay-114.html The Eternal Value of Privacy]." ''[https://www.schneier.com/ Schneier on Security].'' May 18, 2006. Retrieved on May 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."&lt;ref name=SchneierEternal/&gt;

[[Emilio Mordini]], philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something".  What is relevant is not what is hidden, rather  the experience that there is an intimate area, which could be hidden, whose access could be restricted. Psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini "Nothing to Hide — Biometrics, Privacy and Private Sphere." p.257-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian Assange]] states: "There is no killer answer yet. [[Jacob Appelbaum]] (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaksetc.blogspot.nl/2015/04/courage-foundation-reddit-ama.html|title=Courage Foundation: Reddit AMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvey A. Silverglate]] estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2011 |title=Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent |url= |location= |publisher=Encounter Books |page= |isbn=9781594032554 |author-link=Silverglate, Harvey A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against privacy===
[[Eric Schmidt]], the CEO of [[Google]] at the time, said "If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time, and it's important, for example that we are all subject in the United States to the [[Patriot Act]]. It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities."

When discussing the [[MAINWAY]] program, former [[U.S. Senate]] majority leader [[Trent Lott]] stated "What are people worried about? What is the problem? Are you doing something you're not supposed to?" &lt;ref name = "Trent"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Hari]], a British writer, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is irrelevant to the placement of CCTV cameras in public places in the United Kingdom because the cameras are public areas where one is observed by many people he or she would be unfamiliar with and not in "places where you hide".&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Hari|Hari, Johann]].

In November 2015, British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Richard Graham (politician)|Richard Graham]] was accused of quoting [[Joseph Goebbels]] in defending a new surveillance bill with the words "if you've nothing to hide you have nothing to fear". Former Conservative Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] also used the same phrase in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Evan|url=http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/tory-mp-richard-graham-accused-of-quoting-joseph-goebbels-in-defence-of-new-surveillance-bill--bklSCE9nOg|title=Tory MP Richard Graham accused of quoting Joseph Goebbels in defence of new surveillance bill |work=The Independent|date=4 November 2015|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1919 muckraking exposé ''[[The Brass Check]]'', [[Upton Sinclair]] wrote (referring to the 1914 [[Lexington Avenue explosion]]): {{quote|From first to last I had nothing to hide, and for that reason I had nothing to fear, and this was as well known to the newspapers as it was to the police who were probing the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Upton |last=Sinclair |title=The Brass Check |page=194 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026364251#page/n197/mode/1up |year=1919 |publisher=the author |location=Pasadena, CA }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Paramagnetism''' is a form of [[magnetism]] whereby certain materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied [[magnetic field]], and form internal, [[Magnetization|induced magnetic field]]s in the direction of the applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Miessler, G. L. and Tarr, D. A. (2010) ''Inorganic Chemistry'' 3rd ed., Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, {{ISBN|0-13-035471-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramagnetic materials include most [[chemical element]]s and some compounds;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; they have a relative [[magnetic permeability]] slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive [[magnetic susceptibility]]) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The [[magnetic moment]] induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a [[SQUID]] [[magnetometer]].

Paramagnetism is due to the presence of [[unpaired electron]]s in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled [[atomic orbital]]s are paramagnetic.  Due to their [[spin (physics)|spin]], unpaired electrons have a [[magnetic dipole moment]] and act like tiny magnets.  An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction.   Paramagnetic materials include [[aluminium]], [[oxygen]], [[titanium]], and [[iron oxide]] (FeO).

Unlike [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field because [[thermal motion]] randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at [[absolute zero]], meaning they are paramagnetic in the [[ground state]], i.e. in the absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a [[refrigerator magnet]] and the iron of the refrigerator itself.

==Relation to electron spins==
Constituent atoms or molecules of paramagnetic materials have permanent magnetic moments ([[dipole]]s), even in the absence of an applied field. The permanent moment generally is due to the spin of unpaired electrons in [[Atomic orbital|atomic]] or [[Molecular orbital|molecular electron orbitals]] (see [[Magnetic moment]]).  In pure paramagnetism, the  [[dipoles]] do not interact with one another and are randomly oriented in the absence of an external field due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the dipoles will tend to align with the applied field, resulting in a net magnetic moment in the direction of the applied field. In the classical description, this alignment can be understood to occur due to a [[torque]] being provided on the magnetic moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles parallel to the applied field. However, the true origins of the alignment can only be understood via the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] properties of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and [[angular momentum]].

If there is sufficient energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles, they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in [[ferromagnetism]] (permanent magnets) or [[antiferromagnetism]], respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic materials that are above their [[Curie temperature]], and in antiferromagnets above their [[Néel temperature]]. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.

In general, paramagnetic effects are quite small: the [[magnetic susceptibility]] is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; for most paramagnets, but may be as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for synthetic paramagnets such as [[ferrofluid]]s.

In conductive materials, the electrons are [[delocalized]], that is, they travel through the solid more or less as [[Free particle|free electrons]]. Conductivity can be understood in a [[band structure]] picture as arising from the incomplete filling of energy bands.
In an ordinary nonmagnetic conductor the conduction band is identical for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. When a magnetic field is applied, the conduction band splits apart into a spin-up and a spin-down band due to the difference in [[magnetic potential energy]] for spin-up and spin-down electrons.
Since the [[Fermi level]] must be identical for both bands, this means that there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as ''Pauli paramagnetism''.

The effect always competes with a [[diamagnetic]] response of opposite sign due to all the core electrons of the atoms. Stronger forms of magnetism usually require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a band structure can result in which there are two delocalized sub-bands with states of opposite spins that have different energies. If one subband is preferentially filled over the other, one can have itinerant ferromagnetic order. This situation usually only occurs in relatively narrow (d-)bands, which are poorly delocalized.

====s and p electrons====
Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due to large overlap with neighboring wave functions means that there will be a large [[Fermi velocity]]; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the closed shell inner electrons simply wins over the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.

====d and f electrons====
Stronger magnetic effects are typically only observed when d or f electrons are involved. Particularly the latter are usually strongly localized. Moreover, the size of the magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of [[gadolinium]](III) (hence its use in [[MRI]]). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides is one reason why [[rare-earth magnet|superstrong magnets]] are typically based on elements like [[neodymium]] or [[samarium]].

====Molecular localization====
The above picture is a ''generalization'' as it pertains to materials with an extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.

==Theory==
The [[Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem]] proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic moments of the ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both description are given below.
===Curie's law ===
{{main|Curie's law}}
For low levels of magnetization, the magnetization of paramagnets follows what is known as [[Curie's law]], at least approximately.  This law indicates that the susceptibility, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \chi&lt;/math&gt;, of paramagnetic materials is inversely proportional to their temperature, i.e. that materials become more magnetic at lower temperatures.  The mathematical expression is:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{M} = \chi\boldsymbol{H} = \frac{C}{T}\boldsymbol{H}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting magnetization, measured in [[ampere]]s/meter (A/m),
: &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic susceptibility|volume magnetic susceptibility]] ([[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]]),
: &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the auxiliary [[magnetic field]] (A/m),
: &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is absolute temperature, measured in [[kelvin]]s (K),
: &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a material-specific [[Curie constant]] (K).

Curie's law is valid under the commonly encountered conditions of low magnetization (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' ≲ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''), but does not apply in the high-field/low-temperature regime where saturation of magnetization occurs (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' ≳ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'') and magnetic dipoles are all aligned with the applied field. When the dipoles are aligned, increasing the external field will not increase the total magnetization since there can be no further alignment.

For a paramagnetic ion with noninteracting magnetic moments with angular momentum ''J'', the Curie constant is related the individual ions' magnetic moments,

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{n}{3k_\mathrm{B}}\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}^2 \text{ where } \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} \sqrt{J(J+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of atoms per unit volume. The parameter ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is interpreted as the effective magnetic moment per paramagnetic ion.  If one uses a classical treatment with molecular magnetic moments represented as discrete magnetic dipoles, ''μ'', a Curie Law expression of the same form will emerge with ''μ'' appearing in place of ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;.

|Curie's Law can be derived  by considering a substance with noninteracting magnetic moments with angular momentum ''J''.  If orbital contributions to the magnetic moment are negligible (a common case), then in what follows ''J'' = ''S''.  If we apply a magnetic field along what we choose to call the z-axis, the energy levels of each paramagnetic center will experience [[Zeeman splitting]] of its energy levels, each with a ''z''-component labeled by ''M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or just  ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the spin-only magnetic case).  Applying semiclassical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the magnetization of such a substance is

: &lt;math&gt;n\bar{m} = \frac{n\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{\mu_{M_{J}}e^{{-E_{M_{J}}}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{e^{{-E_{M_{J}}}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}} = \frac{n\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}e^{{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}H}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{e^{{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}H}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mu_{M_J}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''z''-component of the magnetic moment for each Zeeman level, so &lt;math&gt;\mu _{M_J} = M_J g_J\mu_\mathrm{B} - \mu_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Bohr magneton]] and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Landé g-factor]], which reduces to the free-electron g-factor, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; when&amp;nbsp;''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''.  (in this treatment, we assume that the ''x''- and ''y''-components of the magnetization, averaged over all molecules, cancel out because the field applied along the ''z''-axis leave them randomly oriented.)  The energy of each Zeeman level is &lt;math&gt;E_{M_J} = -M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H&lt;/math&gt;.  For temperatures over a few ''K'', &lt;math&gt;M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B}H/k_\mathrm{B} T \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, and  we can apply the approximation &lt;math&gt;e^{M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H /k_\mathrm{B} T\;} \simeq 1 + M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\;&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{m}=\frac{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J {M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} e^{M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J e^{M_Jg_J\mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\;}}\simeq g_J\mu_\mathrm{B} \frac{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J M_J \left( 1+M_J g_J\mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\; \right)}{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J \left( 1+M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T \; \right)}=\frac{g_J^2 \mu_\mathrm{B}^2 H}{k_\mathrm{B} T} \frac{\sum\limits_{-J}^J M_J^2}{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J{(1)}},&lt;/math&gt;

which yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{m}=\frac{g_J^2 \mu_\mathrm{B}^2 H}{3k_\mathrm{B} T} J(J+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  The bulk magnetization is then &lt;math&gt;M=n\bar{m} = \frac{n}{3k_\mathrm{B}T} \left[ g_J^2 J(J+1) \mu_\mathrm{B}^2 \right]H,&lt;/math&gt;

and the susceptibility is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\chi=\frac{\partial M_{\rm m}}{\partial H} = \frac{n}{3k_{\rm B} T} \mu_{\mathrm{eff}}^2 \text{  ;    and     } \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = g_J \sqrt{J(J+1)} \mu_{\mathrm B}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

When orbital angular momentum contributions to the magnetic moment are small, as occurs for most organic radicals or for octahedral transition metal complexes with d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or high-spin d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; configurations, the effective magnetic moment takes the form ( with [[G-factor (physics)|g-factor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0023... ≈ 2),

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}\simeq 2\sqrt{S(S+1)} \mu_\mathrm{B} =\sqrt{N_{\rm u}(N_{\rm u}+2)} \mu_\mathrm{B},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of [[Unpaired electron|unpaired electrons]].  In other transition metal complexes this yields a useful, if somewhat cruder, estimate.

=== Pauli paramagnetism ===
For some alkali metals and noble metals, conductions electrons are weakly interacting and delocalized in space forming a [[Fermi gas]]. For these materials one contribution to the magnetic response  comes from the interaction with the electron spins and the magnetic field known as Pauli paramagnetism. For a small magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, the additional energy per electron added from the interaction between an electron spin and the magnetic field is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E= -\mu_0\mathbf{H}\cdot\boldsymbol{\mu}_e=\mp \mu_0\mathbf{H}\cdot\left(-g_e\frac{\mu_\mathrm{B}}{\hbar}\mathbf{S}\right)=\pm \mu_0 \mu_\mathrm{B} H,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron magnetic moment]], &lt;math&gt;\mu_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]], &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Planck constant, and the [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] cancels with the spin &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}=\pm\hbar/2&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the sign is positive (negative) when the electron spin component in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field.
[[File:Pauli_2bis.jpg|thumb|right|In a metal, the application of an external magnetic field increases the density of electrons with spins antiparallel with the field and lowers the density of the electrons with opposite spin. Note: The arrows in this picture indicate magnetic moment, not spin direction.]]

For low temperatures with respect to the [[Fermi energy|Fermi temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_F&lt;/math&gt; (around 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|kelvins]] for metals), the [[number density]] of electrons &lt;math&gt;n_{\uparrow}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n_{\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;) pointing parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;n_{\uparrow}\approx\frac{n_e}{2}-\frac{\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}}{2}g(E_\mathrm{F})H\quad;\quad \left(n_{\downarrow}\approx\frac{n_e}{2}+\frac{\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}}{2}g(E_\mathrm{F})H\right),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; the total free-electrons density and &lt;math&gt;g(E_\mathrm{F})&lt;/math&gt; the electronic density of states (number of states per energy per volume) at the [[Fermi energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{F}&lt;/math&gt;. 

In this approximation the magnetization is given as the magnetic moment of one electron times the difference in densities:

:&lt;math&gt;M=\mu_\mathrm{B}(n_{\downarrow}-n_{\uparrow})=\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}^2g(E_\mathrm{F})H,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields a positive paramagnetic susceptibility independent of temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\mathrm{P}=\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}^2g(E_\mathrm{F}).&lt;/math&gt;

The Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is a macroscopic effect and has to be contrasted with [[Landau diamagnetism|Landau diamagnetic susceptibility]] which is equal to minus one third of Pauli's and also comes from delocalized electrons. The Pauli susceptibility comes from the spin interaction with the magnetic field while the Landau susceptibility comes from the spatial motion of the electrons and it is independent of the spin. In doped semiconductors the ratio between Landau's and Pauli's susceptibilities changes as the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of the charge carriers &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; can differ from the electron mass &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt;. 

The magnetic response calculated for a gas of electrons is not the full picture as the magnetic susceptibility coming from the ions has to be included. Additionally, this formulas may break down for confined systems that differ from the bulk, like [[quantum dot]]s, or  for high fields, as demonstrated in the [[de Haas-van Alphen effect]].

Pauli paramagnetism is named after the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Before Pauli's theory, the lack of a strong Curie paramagnetism in metals was an open problem as the [[Drude model|leading model]] could not account for this contribution without the use of [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|quantum statistics]].

==Examples of paramagnets==
Materials that are called "paramagnets" are most often those that exhibit, at least over an appreciable temperature range, magnetic susceptibilities that adhere to the Curie or Curie–Weiss laws. In principle any system that contains atoms, ions, or molecules with unpaired spins can be called a paramagnet, but the interactions between them need to be carefully considered.

===Systems with minimal interactions===
The narrowest definition would be: a system with unpaired spins that ''do not interact'' with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of [[monatomic hydrogen]] atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron. The latter could be said about a gas of lithium atoms but these already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes more important and in the case of metallic gold it dominates the properties. The element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (''quenched''), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore ''diamagnetic'' and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very much the rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because ''f'' (especially 4''f'') orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms.  Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.nbi.ku.dk/page40667.htm|title=Rare Earth Magnetism|author1=Jensen, J.  |author2=MacKintosh, A.

Thus, condensed phase paramagnets are only possible if the interactions of the spins that lead either to quenching or to ordering are kept at bay by structural isolation of the magnetic centers. There are two classes of materials for which this holds:
*Molecular materials with a (isolated) paramagnetic center.
** Good examples are [[coordination complex]]es of d- or f-metals or proteins with such centers, e.g. [[myoglobin]]. In such materials the organic part of the molecule acts as an envelope shielding the spins from their neighbors.
** Small molecules can be stable in radical form, [[oxygen]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a good example. Such systems are quite rare because they tend to be rather reactive.
* Dilute systems.
** Dissolving a  paramagnetic species in a diamagnetic lattice at small concentrations, e.g. Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will separate the neodymium ions at large enough distances that they do not interact. Such systems are of prime importance for what can be considered the most sensitive method to study paramagnetic systems: [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]].

===Systems with interactions===
[[File:Para-ferro-anti.jpg|thumb|300px|Idealized Curie–Weiss behavior; N.B. T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=θ, but T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is not θ. Paramagnetic regimes are denoted by solid lines. Close to T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; the behavior usually deviates from ideal.]]

As stated above, many materials that contain d- or f-elements do retain unquenched spins. Salts of such elements often show paramagnetic behavior but at low enough temperatures the magnetic moments may order. It is not uncommon to call such materials 'paramagnets', when referring to their paramagnetic behavior above their Curie or Néel-points, particularly if such temperatures are very low or have never been properly measured.  Even for iron it is not uncommon to say that ''iron becomes a paramagnet'' above its relatively high Curie-point. In that case the Curie-point is seen as a [[phase transition]] between a ferromagnet and a 'paramagnet'. The word paramagnet now merely refers to the linear response of the system to an applied field, the temperature dependence of which requires an amended version of Curie's law, known as the [[Curie–Weiss law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{M} = \frac{C}{T- \theta}\boldsymbol{H}&lt;/math&gt;

This amended law includes a term θ that describes the exchange interaction that is present albeit overcome by thermal motion. The sign of θ depends on whether ferro- or antiferromagnetic interactions dominate and it is seldom exactly zero, except in the dilute, isolated cases mentioned above.

Obviously, the paramagnetic Curie–Weiss description above ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; is a rather different interpretation of the word "paramagnet" as it does ''not'' imply the ''absence'' of interactions, but rather that the [[magnetic structure]] is random in the absence of an external field at these sufficiently high temperatures. Even if ''θ'' is close to zero this does not mean that there are no interactions, just that the aligning ferro- and the anti-aligning antiferromagnetic ones cancel. An additional complication is that the interactions are often different in different directions of the crystalline lattice ([[anisotropy]]), leading to complicated [[magnetic structure]]s once ordered.

Randomness of the structure also applies to the many metals that show a net paramagnetic response over a broad temperature range. They do not follow a Curie type law as function of temperature however, often they are more or less temperature independent. This type of behavior is of an itinerant nature and better called Pauli-paramagnetism, but it is not unusual to see, for example, the metal [[aluminium]] called a "paramagnet", even though interactions are strong enough to give this element very good electrical conductivity.

===Superparamagnets===
Some materials show induced magnetic behavior that follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large values for the Curie constants. These materials are known as [[superparamagnetism|superparamagnets]]. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). [[Ferrofluid]]s are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called [[mictomagnetism|mictomagnets]].

{{Emotion}}

Shame is an unpleasant self-conscious emotion typically associated with a negative evaluation of the self, withdrawal motivations, and feelings of distress, exposure, mistrust, powerlessness, and worthlessness. 

== Definition ==

Shame naturally has a negative valence, but it helps us define the boundaries of our positive pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;tompkins.org&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of shame is a discrete, basic emotion, described as a moral or social emotion that drives people to hide or deny their wrongdoings.&lt;ref&gt;Shein, L. (2018). The Evolution of Shame and Guilt. PLoSONE, 13(7), 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of shame is on the self or the individual; it is the only emotion that is dysfunctional for the individual and functional at a group level. Shame can also be described as an unpleasant self-conscious emotion that involves negative evaluation of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Parsa, S. (2018). Psychological Construction of Shame in Disordered Eating. New Psychology Bulletin, 15(1), 11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame can be a painful emotion that is seen as a “…comparison of the self’s action with the self’s standards…” but may equally stem from comparison of the self’s state of being with the ideal social contexts standard. 
Some scales measure shame to assess emotional states, whereas other shame scales are used to assess emotional traits or dispositions- shame proneness.&lt;ref&gt;Schalkwijk, F., Stams, G. J., Dekker, J., &amp; Elison, J. (2016). Measuring Shame Regulations: Validation of the Compass of Shame Scale. Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal, 44(11), 1775-1791.&lt;/ref&gt; "To shame" generally means to actively assign or communicate a state of shame to another person. Behaviors designed to "uncover" or "expose" others are sometimes used to place shame on the other person. Whereas, having shame means to maintain a sense of restraint against offending others (as with modesty, humility, and deference). In contrast to having shame is to have no shame; behave without the restraint to offend others, similar to other emotions like pride or hubris.

== Self-Evaluation Emotion ==

When people feel shame, the focus of their evaluation is on the self or identity. .&lt;ref&gt;Schalkwijk, F., Stams, G. J., Dekker, J., &amp; Elison, J. (2016). Measuring Shame Regulations: Validation of the Compass of Shame Scale. Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal, 44(11), 1775-1791.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame is a self-punishing acknowledgment of something gone wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, P. M., Krauth-Gruber, S. &amp; Ric, F. (2017). Psychology of Emotion: Self-Conscious Emotions. New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with “mental undoing”; when you genuinely feel like a bad person. Studies of shame showed that when ashamed people feel that their entire self is worthless, powerless, and small, they also feel exposed to an audience -real or imagined- that exists purely for the purpose of confirming that the self is worthless. Shame and the sense of self is stigmatized, or treated unfairly, like being overtly rejected by parents in favor of siblings’ needs, and is assigned externally by others regardless of one’s own experience or awareness. An individual who is in a state of shame, will assign the shame internally from being a victim of the environment, and the same is assigned externally, or assigned by others regardless of one's own experience or awareness.

A "sense of shame" is the feeling known as [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] but "consciousness" or awareness of "shame as a state" or condition defines core/toxic shame (Lewis, 1971; Tangney, 1998). The key emotion in all forms of shame is contempt (Miller, 1984; Tomkins, 1967). Two realms in which shame is expressed are the ''consciousness of self as bad'' and ''self as inadequate''.&lt;ref name="GreenbergKoole2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Greenberg|author2=Sander L.

== Etymology ==

The root of the word shame is thought to derive from the word hama. According to etymologists, the Old English word hama, is a veil or covering that one might wear in order to signal penitence.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, G. (2015). Shame vs. Guilt. Virginia Quarterly Review, 91(1), 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; I.e. a person who has committed an offense need not worry about being punished by an external agent, since he or she is doing plenty of self-punishing.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, G. (2015). Shame vs. Guilt. Virginia Quarterly Review, 91(1), 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the sense of shame, hama simply means “covering” which is literally and figuratively a natural expression of shame. 

== How to Identify Shame ==

Nineteenth-century scientist Charles Darwin described shame affect in the physical form of blushing, confusion of mind, downward cast eyes, slack posture, and lowered head; Darwin noted these observations of shame affect in human populations worldwide, as mentioned in his book "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals". Darwin also mentions how the sense of warmth or heat, associated with the vasodilation of the face and skin, can result in an even more sense of shame. More commonly, the act of crying can be associated with shame.

== Comparison with guilt ==

[[File:Goya9.jpg|thumb|right|Person hiding face and showing posture of shame (while wearing a [[Sanbenito]] and coroza hat) in [[Goya]]'s sketch "For being born somewhere else".  The person has been shamed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].]]

The boundaries between concepts of shame, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and [[embarrassment]] are not easily delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Are shame, guilt, and embarrassment distinct emotions? | last = Tangney | first = JP |author2=Miller Flicker Barlow | year = 1996 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.6.1256 | volume = 70 | pages = 1256–69 | pmid=8667166 | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]], shame is a violation of cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one's internal values. Thus shame arises when one's 'defects' are exposed to others, and results from the negative evaluation (whether real or imagined) of others; guilt, on the other hand, comes from one's own negative evaluation of oneself, for instance, when one acts contrary to one's values or idea of one's self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.stanford.edu/~tsailab/PDF/yw07sce.pdf "Cultural Models of Shame and Guilt"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418071015/http://psych.stanford.edu/~tsailab/PDF/yw07sce.pdf |date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it might be possible to feel ashamed of thought or behavior that no one actually knows about [since one fears their discovery] and conversely, to feel guilty about actions that gain the approval of others.

Psychoanalyst Helen B. Lewis argued that, "The experience of shame is directly about the self, which is the focus of evaluation. In guilt, the self is not the central object of negative evaluation, but rather the thing done is the focus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Lewis |first= Helen B. |title=Shame and guilt in neurosis |publisher=International University Press, New York |year= 1971 |isbn= 0-8236-8307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Fossum and Mason say in their book ''Facing Shame'' that "While guilt is a painful feeling of regret and responsibility for one's actions, shame is a painful feeling about oneself as a person."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Fossum |first= Merle A. |last2=Mason |first2=Marilyn J. |title=Facing Shame: Families in Recovery |publisher= [[W.W. Norton]] |year= 1986 |isbn= 0-393-30581-3 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this line of reasoning, Psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman concludes that "Shame is an acutely self-conscious state in which the self is 'split,' imagining the self in the eyes of the other; by contrast, in guilt the self is unified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Shattered Shame States and their Repair |last=Herman |first=Judith Lewis |author-link=Judith_Lewis_Herman |journal=The John Bowlby Memorial Lecture |year=2007 |url=http://www.cha.harvard.edu/vov/publications/Shattered%20Shame-JHerman.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705095700/http://www.cha.harvard.edu/vov/publications/Shattered%20Shame-JHerman.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical psychologist Gershen Kaufman's view of shame is derived from that of [[affect theory]], namely that shame is one of a set of instinctual, short-duration physiological reactions to stimulation.&lt;ref name=Kauf92&gt;{{Citation |last= Kaufman |first= Gershen |title=Shame: The Power of Caring |edition=3rd |publisher=Schenkman Books, Rochester, VT |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-87047-052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Nathanson |first= Donald |title=Shame and Pride: Affect, Sex, and the Birth of the Self |publisher=W.W. Norton, NY |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-393-03097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, guilt is considered to be a learned behavior consisting essentially of self-directed [[blame]] or [[contempt]], with shame occurring consequent to such behaviors making up a part of the overall experience of guilt. Here, [[self-blame]] and [[self-contempt]] mean the application, towards (a part of) one's self, of exactly the same dynamic that blaming of, and contempt for, others represents when it is applied interpersonally.

Kaufman saw that mechanisms such as blame or contempt may be used as a defending strategy against the experience of shame and that someone who has a pattern of applying them to himself may well attempt to defend against a shame experience by applying self-blame or self-contempt. This, however, can lead to an internalized, self-reinforcing sequence of shame events for which Kaufman coined the term "shame spiral".&lt;ref name=Kauf92 /&gt; (However, notice that the word "shame spiral" or "spiral of shame" might also be used to indicate *public shaming*, I.e. The behavior of attacking somebody en masse for his/her viewpoints or particular words. This can especially refer to cyber bullying). Shame can also be used as a strategy when feeling guilt, in particular when there is the hope to avoid punishment by inspiring pity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shame and the Origins of Self-esteem: A Jungian Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VA5rfWW3HIC&amp;pg=PR2|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-10580-4|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One view of difference between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but in order to be embarrassed one's actions must be revealed to others. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate as to whether or not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others.

Another view of the dividing line between shame and embarrassment holds that the difference is one of intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|pages=75–78|ISBN=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view embarrassment is simply a less intense experience of shame. It is adaptive and functional.  Extreme or toxic shame is a much more intense experience and one that is not functional. In fact on this view toxic shame can be debilitating. The dividing line then is between functional and dysfunctional shame. This includes the idea that shame has a function or benefit for the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|pages=62|ISBN=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] and his followers held that shame is heteronomous (comes from others); [[Bernard Williams]] and others have argued that shame can be autonomous (comes from oneself).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Bernard: Shame and Necessity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Phil: chapter four of Shame and Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable. Another view of shame and guilt is that shame is a focus on self, while guilt is a focus on behavior. Simply put:  A person who feels guilt is saying "I did something bad.", while someone who feels shame is saying "I am bad".

== Comparison with Embarrassment ==

Embarrassment has occasionally been viewed in the literature as a less severe or intense form of shame, but it is distinct from shame in that it involves a focus on the self-presented to an audience rather than the entire self, and that it is experienced as a sense of fluster and slight mortification resulting from a social awkwardness that leads to a loss of esteem in the eyes of others. We have characterized embarrassment as a sudden-onset sense of fluster and mortification that results when the self is evaluated negatively because one has committed, or anticipates committing, a gaffe or awkward performance before an audience. So, because shame is focused on the entire self, those who become embarrassed apologize for their mistake, and then begin to repair things and this repair involves redressing harm done to the presented self.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, P. M., Krauth-Gruber, S. &amp; Ric, F. (2017). Psychology of Emotion: Self-conscious Emotions. New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt;
One view of difference between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does; that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but in order to be embarrassed one's actions must be revealed to others. Therefore shame can only be experienced in private and embarrassment can never be experienced in private.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, P. M., Krauth-Gruber, S. &amp; Ric, F. (2017). Psychology of Emotion: Self-conscious Emotions. New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate as to whether or not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others. This is a mature heteronomous type of shame where the agent does not judge herself negatively, but, due to the negative judgments of others, suspects that she may deserve negative judgment, and feel shame on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, D. J. (2012). Shame: In Defense of an Essential Moral Emotion. PhD thesis, Birkbeck, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable.

== The Shame, Guilt and Anger Study ==

The manner in which children, adolescents, and adults manage and express their feelings of anger has caught the attention of June Price Tangney and her colleagues. They looked into previous studies that had been performed prior to the creation of their own report. While looking at studies done of college students, shame was not experienced alone. Anger arousal, suspiciousness, resentment, irritability, a tendency to blame others for negative events, and indirect expressions of hostility were all experienced with the emotion of shame. College students were more likely to report a desire to punish others, as well as a desire to hide, when rating personal shame versus guilt experiences and that is when these other emotions increase feelings of shame.&lt;ref&gt;Tangney, J.P., Wagner, P. E., Hill-Barlow, D., Marschall, D. E., &amp; Gramzow, R. (1996). Relation of Shame and Guilt to Constructive Versus Destructive Responses to anger Across the Lifespan. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70(4), 797-809.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tangney et al. found that shame is painful, exposing, disapproving, self-directed, and causes forms of defense towards others. These characteristics are extreme, but shame enters a new level when one’s behavior becomes avoidant, retaliated, and blaming. In redirecting anger outside the self, shamed individuals may be attempting to regain a sense of agency and control which is so often impaired in the shame experience, so they looked at possibilities of how anger and shame go hand in hand. Once angered, people often feel ashamed of being angry, the experience of shame itself fosters feelings of other-directed anger and hostility, and the acute pain of shame can lead to a sense of ‘humiliated fury’ directly toward the self and toward a real or imagined disapproving other. Negative affect fosters feelings of anger and the ‘instigation to aggress’. Thus, from this perspective it may be the pain of shame that accounts for its link with indexes of anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Tangney, J.P., Wagner, P. E., Hill-Barlow, D., Marschall, D. E., &amp; Gramzow, R. (1996). Relation of Shame and Guilt to Constructive Versus Destructive Responses to anger Across the Lifespan. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70(4), 797-809.&lt;/ref&gt;
The study performed by Tangney et al. explored relation of shame proneness and guilt proneness to constructive versus destructive responses to anger among 302 children, 427 adolescents, 176 college students, 194 adults. During the study, it proved that shame proneness did relate to maladaptive anger. From the study, we found out that children were positively correlated with guilt and was not related to shame, but when looking at the older participants, the results were more varied than the children.

'''Participants:''' The study was done with children from an elementary school, a large university, and people traveling through a large urban airport where data took place on the weekends to avoid bias business travelers.
Procedures: The participants all filled out the ARI and TOSCA questionnaires in many different small groups that were conducted on different days. Children, adolescents, and college students all followed the same procedures. For the non-college adults (airport travelers) sample, they completed the ARI and TOSCA as a single packet questionnaire in the airport waiting areas.

'''Results:''' The results on table 1, 2, and 3 showed that the relationship of shame and guilt to anger-related indexes for children, adolescents, college students, and adults. This showed shame was factored out from guilt and could also be shown in a vice versa manner. In the range of the study, it proved that shame and guilt proneness correlated highly positively. There were many factors that proved these correlations. Shame and guilt share a number of common features. When dealing with shame and guilt, they can also interact with respect in the same situation. In the study, (Tangney, Burggraf, &amp; Wagner, 1995), we found that the effect of partialling out guilt from shame is negligible. Guilt represents how people are experiencing feeling guilty but without them feeling shame.

'''Table One:''' In the experiment, when looking at table 1 we are comparing the relation of shame and guilt to anger arousal. When we look at table one, shame was highly correlated to anger arousal. When looking at the proneness to guilt uncomplicated by shame, it showed a negative correlation with anger in children. When looking at the adolescents, college students, and adults, it showed as no relation. When you look at the numbers, the numbers of the children and adolescents were very different, but not when you compared the numbers to the college students and adults in the study. The variables below showed people’s characteristic intentions when they are angry. In this study, the participants were asked to rate what they would feel like doing when they are angry, but not the action they would actually take when they are angry. The participants were given a reference to each scenario. Here, there was shown some shocking differences in correlation between shame and guilt. In this study shame was more positively correlated. The study showed that the correlations between guilt and constructive intentions became less pronounced with age, which was predicted. 

'''Table Two:''' Table two shows that the shame-prone participants are more [[[prone]] to anger than non-shame-prone participants but are also be more likely to have unconstructive actions with their anger. This goes for all ages which would be eights years old all the way to adulthood. It was clear that shame-prone individuals had to do with unconstructive responses to anger and are maladaptive. In the indexes of direct, physical, verbal and aggression that is aimed directly at the target(symbolic aggression), was true in aspect of proving that shame-proneness relates to maladaptive and unconstructed behavior. When measuring symbolic aggression, the scale measure the nonverbal reactions like slamming doors and shaking their fists. Symbolic aggression does not have any direct physical touch. The same pattern continued with Indirect Aggression scales which would be breaking something of value to that person and malediction which would be talking behind their back. When a person may be very angry at his or her spouse then goes home and takes it out on the spouse then that would be measured by the Displaced Aggression Scale, which this indeed also followed the same pattern. The Anger Held in scale concludes there is a {ruminative} kind of anger. Which would be obsessively and constantly thinking about the situation over and over in your head. Looking at the proneness to shame-free, guilt was negatively correlated with the indexes of aggression with all ages. Table two shows that holding anger in and ruminating on it was strongly correlated with shame and with all ages. There is one exception, Self-Aggression scale, which is being angry at oneself for the situation for example (I am mad at myself for trusting him/her in the first place). Self-Aggression was positively correlated with shame of all ages, but it was also moderately positively correlated with proneness to shame free guilt among college students and adults. In conclusion, besides Self Aggression, these indexes of aggressive responses to anger showed consistency with proneness to shame and proneness to guilt. People prone to feel shame about the entire self are much more likely to have an aggressive response in contrast to less shame-prone. When angered, people who are guilt prone are less likely to be aggressive. 

'''Table Three:''' In table three the first cluster shows the Relations of Shame and Guilt to Direct Constructive Response to Anger. This is looking at the target of their anger is a non hostile way. In this experiment, across the four age groups “shame free” guilt was shown to correlate with anger management strategies. Shame was unrelated to the responses of anger. As with the same assumptions to constructive intentions, it was assumed guilt and adaptive response to anger would go up with age. But, in the study it showed the opposite that adults were actually lower than children. In the next cluster we look at Escapist-Diffusing responses. These were not clearly shown as adaptive or maladaptive. This study was done to attempt to diffuse anger. Examples of this would be, going on a run to distract you, hanging out with friends, etc. You want to be able to remove yourself from the situation by doing nothing. The findings from this experiment were very mixed. The experiment showed that shame was not related to the likelihood of developing these tendencies, which would show a positive correlation in shame between all of the age groups. This showed as people get older, they learn to react to anger and let the situation pass even though it might not be the best situation in the long run. The next cluster looks at Cognitive Reappraisals of Anger-Eliciting Situations. This means, once people are mad they often go back and rethink the persons roll in the situation. You go back and think wondering if you made the mistake or if the other person did or if it could have been prevented. The results showed that shame and anger are mixed in Cognitive Reappraisals or Anger-Eliciting Situations. Shame was unrelated to reappraisals, except it was found in college students. The last cluster of of variables is the Projected Long-Term Consequences of Everyday Episodes of Anger. Participants were asked to think about an event and how they would respond to it and how long that their consequence would be. It was proved that the proneness to shame was generally inversely related to positive long term consequence. The results were highest in older participants. The people who were shame prone did not think about the consequences of their anger.&lt;ref&gt;Tangney, J.P., Wagner, P. E., Hill-Barlow, D., Marschall, D. E., &amp; Gramzow, R. (1996). Relation of Shame and Guilt to Constructive Versus Destructive Responses to anger Across the Lifespan. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70(4), 797-809.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Four Subtypes of Shame ==

There are many different reasons that people might feel shame. According to Joseph Burgo, there are four different aspects of shame. He calls these aspects of shame paradigms. In his first subdivision of shame he looks into is unrequited love; which is when you love someone but your partner does not reciprocate, or one is rejected by somebody that they like; this can be mortifying and shaming. Unrequited love can be shown in other ways as well. For example, the way a mother treats her new born baby. An experiment was done where a mother showed her baby love and talked to the baby for a set period of time. She then went a few minutes without talking to the baby. This resulted with the baby making different expressions to get the mother’s attention. When the mother stopped giving the baby attention, the baby felt shame. The second type of shame is unwanted exposure. This would take place if you were called out in front of a whole class for doing something wrong or if someone saw you doing something you didn’t want them to see. This is what you would normally think of when you hear the word shame. Disappointed expectation would be your third type of shame according to Burgo. This could be not passing a class, having a friendship go wrong, or not getting a big promotion in a job that you thought you would get. The fourth and final type of shame according to Burgo is exclusion which also means being left out. Many people will do anything to just fit in or want to belong in today’s society. This happens all the time at school, work, friendships, relationships, everywhere. People will do anything to prove that they belong. Shame causes a lot of stress on people daily, but it also teaches people a lot of lessons. Without having shame people would never be able to learn a lesson and never be able to grow from their mistakes.

Toxic shame often induces what is known as ''complex'' [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] in children who cannot cope with toxic shaming as it occurs and who [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]] the shame until it is possible to cope with.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, John (2005) ''Healing the Shame That Binds You'' (2nd edition) Health Communications, Deerfield Beach, Florida, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JTuDfNyWR7kC&amp;pg=PA101 page 101] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828010451/https://books.google.com/books?id=JTuDfNyWR7kC&amp;pg=PA101 |date=August 28, 2016 }}, {{ISBN|0-7573-0323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vicarious shame''': refers to the experience of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to [[neurosis|neuroticism]] and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term for this feeling is 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the [[German language|German]] term is ''die Fremdscham'' and in the [[Spanish language]] it is referred to as ''vergüenza ajena''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus, F.M., Müller-Pinzler, L., Jansen, A., Gazzola, V. and Krach, S., 2014. [https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/25/8/2065/311252 Mentalizing and the role of the posterior superior temporal sulcus in sharing others' embarrassment]. [[Cerebral cortex]], 25(8), pp.2065-2075.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shame Code ==

The Shame Code was developed to capture behavior as it unfolds in real time during the socially stressful and potentially shaming spontaneous speech task and was coded into the following categories: (1) Body Tension, (2) Facial Tension, (3) Stillness, (4) Fidgeting, (5) Nervous Positive Affect, (6) Hiding and Avoiding, (7) Verbal Flow and Uncertainty, and (8) Silence.&lt;ref&gt;De France, K., Lanteigne, D., Glozman, J. &amp; Hollenstain, T. (2017). A New Measure of the Expression of Shame: The Shame Code. Journal of Child &amp; Family Studies, 26(3), 769-780.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fidget Factor:''' hiding, fidgeting, nervous positive and low levels of stillness.
Individuals high on Fidget displayed high levels of fidgeting and hiding behaviors, such as hiding their face and avoiding any eye contact with the experimenter, and low nervous positive affect or still-ness. By making repeated movements and avoiding direct contact with the experimenter, individuals who scored high on the Fidget factor communicated clearly and obviously that they were distressed while giving a speech. This non-verbal communication is a signal of discomfort to the observer and is perhaps an unconscious request for help.” These behaviors that are included in the fidget factor lead youth to have difficulty forming relationships as these actions may be perceived as inauthentic or secretive. Fidgeting has been identified through discourse analysis of couples in conflict as a visual cue of shame, related to facial tension and masking of expressions.

'''Freeze Factor:''' stillness, facial tension and silence. 
Individuals who scored higher on this factor typically displayed a lack of any movement, facial tension such as lip biting and furrowing their brows, and a lack of any spoken words. Freezing is ultimately a withdrawal from a situation that one cannot escape physically, hence providing no action (in this case a speech) may reflect an effort to eliminate the possibility of negative evaluation. These behaviors that are included in the freeze factor "reflected participants" actual internalized shame, consistent with previous research. Freezing is a behavioral response to threat in mammals and it may be that those who scored higher on this factor were experiencing more intense shame during the speech. They convey a sense of helplessness that may initially elicit sympathetic or comforting actions.

'''Trait Shame:''' A negative evaluation implies flaws reflective of the self, rather than of a behavior.

'''State Shame:''' When depending on your current state, do you feel shame?

Shame proneness was associated with more fidgeting and less freezing, but both stillness and fidgeting are social cues that communicate distress to observers, and may elicit less harsh responses. Thus, both may be an attempt to diminish further shaming experiences.
Shame involves global, self-focused negative attributions based on the anticipated, imagined, or real negative evaluations of others and is accompanied by a powerful urge to hide, withdraw, or escape from the source of these evaluations. These negative evaluations arise from transgressions of standards, rules, or goals and cause the individual to feel separate from the group for which these standards, rules, or goals exist, resulting in one of the most powerful, painful, and potentially destructive experiences known to humans.&lt;ref&gt;De France, K., Lanteigne, D., Glozman, J. &amp; Hollenstain, T. (2017). A New Measure of the Expression of Shame: The Shame Code. Journal of Child &amp; Family Studies, 26(3), 769-780.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shame and Narcissism ==

It has been suggested that [[narcissism]] in adults is related to defenses against shame&lt;ref name=shame1&gt;Wurmser L, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gyyoS851HYcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22Shame,+the+veiled+companion+of+narcissism%22&amp;ots=fx1W75L_u_&amp;sig=D9AcfG4RSuGKbvfWhVlVMvmO0AQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shame%2C%20the%20veiled%20companion%20of%20narcissism%22&amp;f=false Shame, the veiled companion of narcissism], in The Many Faces of Shame, edited by Nathanson DL. New York, Guilford, 1987, pp. 64–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is connected to shame as well.&lt;ref name=shame2&gt;Gabbard GO, [http://jppr.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=2819295&amp;link_type=MEDTwo subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder.]{{dead link|date=March 2016}} Bull Menninger Clin 1989; 53:527–532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Klosko, Weishaar: Schema Therapy – A Practitioner's Guide, 2003, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]], [[Narcissistic personality disorder|NPD]] can be broken down into two subtypes, a [[grandiose]], arrogant, thick-skinned "oblivious" subtype and an easily hurt, oversensitive, ashamed "[[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]" subtype. The oblivious subtype presents for [[Narcissistic supply|admiration]], envy, and appreciation a grandiose self that is the antithesis of a weak internalized self which hides in shame, while the [[hypervigilant]] subtype neutralizes devaluation by seeing others as unjust abusers.&lt;ref name=shame2 /&gt;

== Stigma and Shame ==

Stigma occurs when society labels someone as tainted, less desirable, or handicapped. This negative evaluation may be “felt” or “enacted”. When felt, it refers to the shame associated with having a condition and the fear of being discriminated against... when enacted it refers to actual discrimination of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, A., Ziebland, S. &amp; McPherson, A. (2004). Stigma, Shame, and blame experienced by patients with lung cancer: qualitative study. British Medical Journal, 328(7454), 1470-1473.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame in relation to stigma studies have most often come from the sense and mental consequences that young adolescents find themselves trapped in when they are deciding to use a condom in STD or HIV protection. The other use of stigma and shame is when someone has a disease, such as cancer, where people look to blame something for their feelings of shame and circumstance of sickness. Jessica M. Sales et al. researched young adolescents ages 15-21 on whether they had used protection in the 14 days prior to coming in for the study. The answers showed implications of shame and stigma, which received an accommodating score. The scores, prior history of STDs, [[demographics]], and [[psychosocial]] variables were put into a [[hierarchical]] [[regression model]] to determine probability of an adolescents chances of using protected sex in the future. The study found that the higher sense of shame and stigma the higher chance the adolescent would use protection in the future. This means that if a person is more aware of consequences, is more in-tune with themselves and the stigma (stereotypes, disgrace, etc.), they will be more likely to protect themselves. The study shows that placing more shame and stigma in the mind of people can be more prone to protecting themselves from the consequences that follow the action of unprotected sex.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, J. M., DiClemente, R. J., Rose, E. S., Wingood, G. M., Klein, J. D. &amp; Woods, E. R. (2007). Relationship of STD-Related Shame and Stigma to Female Adolescents' Condom-Protected Intercourse. Journal of Adolescent Health, 40, 573.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HIV]]-related stigma from those who are born with HIV due to their [[maternal]] [[genetics]] have a proneness to shame and avoidant coping. David S. Bennett et al. studied the ages 12-24 of self-reported measures of potential risk factors and three domains of internalizing factors: [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[PTSD]]. The findings suggested that those who had more shame-proneness and more awareness of HIV-stigma had a greater amount of depressive and PTSD symptoms. This means that those who have high HIV-stigma and shame do not seek help from interventions. Rather, they avoid the situation that could cause them to find themselves in a predicament of other mental health issues. Older age was related to greater HIV-related stigma and the female gender was more related to stigma and internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety, PTSD). Stigma was also associated with greater shame-proneness.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, D. S., Hersh, J., Herres, J. &amp; Foster, J. (2016). HIV-Related Stigma, Shame, and Avoidant Coping: Risk Factors for Internalizing Symptoms Among Youth Living with HIV? Child Psychology &amp; Human Development, 47(4), 657-664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapple et al. researched people with lung cancer in regards to the shame and stigma that comes from the disease. The stigma that accompanies lung cancer is most commonly caused by smoking. However, there are many ways to contract lung cancer, therefore those who did not receive lung cancer from smoking often feel shame; blaming themselves for something they did not do. The stigma effects their opinions of themselves, while shame is found to blame other cancer causing factors ([[tobacco]] products/anti-tobacco products) or ignoring the disease in avoidant [[coping (psychology)|coping]] altogether. The stigma associated with lung cancer effected relationships of patients with their family members, peers, and physicians who were attempting to provide comfort because the patients felt shame and victimized themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, A., Ziebland, S. &amp; McPherson, A. (2004). Stigma, Shame, and blame experienced by patients with lung cancer: qualitative study. British Medical Journal, 328(7454), 1470-1473.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social aspects ==
[[File:Taunting 0001.jpg|thumb|right|A girl feeling ashamed as two other girls taunt behind her back.]]
According to the anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]], [[culture]]s may be classified by their emphasis on the use of either shame (a [[shame society]]) or guilt to regulate the social activities of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pattison, ''Shame:Theory, Therapy and Theology''. Cambridge University Press. 2000. 54. {{ISBN|0521560454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shame may be used by those people who commit [[relational aggression]] and may occur in the workplace as a form of overt social control or aggression. Shaming is used in some societies as a type of [[punishment]], [[shunning]], or [[ostracism]]. In this sense, ‟the real purpose of shaming is not to punish crimes but to create the kind of people who don't commit them‟.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Scruton, BRING BACK STIGMA, in Modern Sex: Liberation and its Discontents, Chicago 2001, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shame campaign ===
A shame campaign is a tactic in which particular individuals are singled out because of their behavior or suspected crimes, often by marking them publicly, such as [[Hester Prynne]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''. In the [[Philippines]], [[Alfredo Lim]] popularized such tactics during his term as mayor of [[Manila]]. On July 1, 1997, he began a controversial "spray paint shame campaign” in an effort to stop drug use. He and his team sprayed bright red paint on two hundred squatter houses whose residents had been charged, but not yet convicted, of selling prohibited substances. Officials of other municipalities followed suit. Former Senator Rene A. Saguisag condemned Lim’s policy.&lt;ref&gt;Pulta, Benjamin B. [http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2003/06/26/news/spray.campaign.debate.heats.up.html "Spray campaign debate heats up."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200045/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2003/06/26/news/spray.campaign.debate.heats.up.html |date=September 27, 2007 }} ''Sun.Star Manila.''

== Research ==

Psychologists and other researchers who study shame use validated [[psychometric testing]] instruments to determine whether or how much a person feels shame.  Some of these tools include the Guilt and Shame Proneness (GASP) Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some scales are specific to the person's situation, such as the Weight- and Body-Related Shame and Guilt scale (WEB-SG), the HIV Stigma Scale for [[people living with HIV]] and the Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale (CLCSS) for people with [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''snake pit''' is, in a literal sense, a hole filled with [[snake]]s. In idiomatic speech, "snake pits" are places of horror, torture and even death in European legends and fairy tales. The [[Viking]] [[warlord]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok]] is said to have been thrown into a snake pit and died there, after his army had been defeated in battle by King [[Aelle II of Northumbria]]. An older legend recorded in ''[[Atlakviða]]'' and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'' tells that [[Attila the Hun]] murdered [[Gunther|Gunnarr]], the [[King of Burgundy]], in a snake pit. In a medieval German poem, [[Dietrich von Bern]] is thrown into a snake pit by the [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] Sigenot – he is protected by a magical jewel that had been given to him earlier by a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=rZY4rO5laI&amp;dq=he%20origin%20of%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Csnake%20pit%E2%80%9D%20for%20insane%20asylum&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20origin%20of%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Csnake%20pit%E2%80%9D%20for%20insane%20asylum&amp;f=false "Coerrcion as Cure: A critical history of psychiatry".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17347">"'''There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom: An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics'''" was a lecture given by [[physics|physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] at the annual [[American Physical Society]] meeting at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] on December 29, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://metamodern.com/2009/12/29/theres-plenty-of-room-at-the-bottom%E2%80%9D-feynman-1959/ | title= There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom |last=Drexler|first=Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual [[atom]]s as a more powerful form of synthetic [[chemistry]] than those used at the time. Versions of the talk were printed in a few popular magazines within a year and newspapers covered the winning of the presented challenges in 1960 and again in 1985. The talk went unnoticed and did not inspire the conceptual beginnings of the field, but nanotechnology research advocates began citing it in the 1990s to establish the scientific credibility of their work.

==Conception==
Feynman considered a number of interesting ramifications of a general ability to manipulate matter on an atomic scale. He was particularly interested in the possibilities of denser [[computer]] circuitry, and [[microscope]]s that could see things much smaller than is possible with [[scanning electron microscope]]s. These ideas were later realized by the use of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]], the [[atomic force microscope]] and other examples of [[scanning probe microscopy]] and storage systems such as [[IBM Millipede|Millipede]], created by researchers at [[International Business Machines|IBM]].

Feynman also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make [[nanobots|nanoscale machines]] that "arrange the atoms the way we want", and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation.

He also presented the possibility of "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallowing the doctor]]", an idea that he credited in the essay to his friend and graduate student [[Albert Hibbs]]. This concept involved building a tiny, swallowable surgical robot.

As a thought experiment he proposed developing a set of one-quarter-scale manipulator hands slaved to the operator's hands to build one-quarter scale machine tools analogous to those found in any machine shop. This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve [[massively parallel]] operations. He uses the analogy of a [[pantograph]] as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1942 story ''[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]''.&lt;ref name=Milburn&gt;Colin Milburn. ''Nanovision: Engineering the Future''. Duke University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-8223-4265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ed Regis. ''Nano''. Bantam, 1997. {{ISBN|0-553-50476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the sizes got smaller, one would have to redesign some tools, because the relative strength of various forces would change. Although [[gravity]] would become unimportant, surface tension would become more important, [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] attraction would become important, etc. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment, although it has been noted that some types of biological [[enzymes]] and enzyme complexes (especially [[ribosomes]]) function chemically in a way close to Feynman's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11283358 |doi=10.1126/science.1060089 | volume=292 | issue=5518 | title=Crystal structure of the ribosome at 5.5 A resolution |date=May 2001 | journal=Science | pages=883–96  |vauthors=Yusupov MM, Yusupova GZ, Baucom A, etal |bibcode=2001Sci...292..883Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Q, et al, ''Statistical Analysis of Interface Similarity in Crystals of Homologous Proteins'', J.

==Challenges==
At the meeting Feynman concluded his talk with two challenges, and he offered a prize of $1000 for the first individuals to solve each one. The first challenge involved the construction of a [[nanomotor|tiny motor]], which, to Feynman's surprise, was achieved by November 1960 by Caltech graduate, [[William McLellan (American electrical engineer)|William McLellan]], a meticulous craftsman, using conventional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/207/1/themonth.pdf|title=The World's Smallest Motor|last=|first=|date=December 1960|work=Engineering and Science|access-date=2018-07-22|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor met the conditions, but did not advance the art. The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale. In 1985, [[Tom Newman (scientist)|Tom Newman]], a Stanford graduate student, successfully reduced the first paragraph of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' by 1/25,000, and collected the second Feynman prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/404585707/|title=Small Wonder|date=July 30, 1986|page=26|work=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California on Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard Phillips |last1=Feynman |first2=Christopher |last2=Sykes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HxzLaPYo2IC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175 |title=No Ordinary Genius: The Illustrated Richard Feynman] |page=175 |publisher=W.

==Reception==
''[[New Scientist|The New Scientist]]'' reported "the scientific audience was captivated." Feynman had "spun the idea off the top of his mind" without even "notes from beforehand". There were no copies of the speech for those asking for copies. A "foresighted admirer" brought a tape recorder and an edited transcript, without Feynman's jokes, was made for publication by Caltech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_zBbRPOil4C&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220&amp;q=Feynman&amp;f=false|title=A staggering small world|last=Lear|first=John|date=21 July 1960|work=The New Scientist|access-date=2018-07-22|page=220|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1960, Caltech's ''Engineering and Science'' published the speech. In addition to excerpts in ''The New Scientist'', versions were printed in ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]'' and ''[[Popular Science]]''. Newspapers announced the winning of the first challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/38978614/|title=Midget Motor Wins $1,000 Prize for Engineer|date=November 30, 1960|page=25|work=The Times from San Mateo, California on Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/56727530/|title=World's Smallest Motor|date=January 12, 1961|page=27|work=The Pocono Record from Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania on Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included as the final chapter in the 1961 book, ''Miniaturization''.

==Impact==
{{See also|History of nanotechnology}}
[[K. Eric Drexler]] later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]''.

After Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of [[nanotechnology]] have concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman's talk, along with the record of citations to “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Toumey. “Apostolic Succession.” ''Engineering &amp; Science'' 1/2 (2005): 16–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Toumey. [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf "Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science"]. ''Techné'' 13.3 (2008):133–168. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919171108/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf |date=September 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Toumey's 2008 article, "Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology", he found 11 versions of the publication of “Plenty of Room", plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, “Infinitesimal Machinery,” which Feynman called “Plenty of Room, Revisited.”  Also in Toumey's references are videotapes of that second talk.

Toumey found that the published versions of Feynman's talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981.  Subsequently,  interest in “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term “nanotechnology” gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined "Nanotechnology", published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, [[Omni (magazine)|''OMNI'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= "Nanotechnology" / "Tinytech" | page=56 |journal=Omni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The journal ''Nanotechnology'' was launched in 1989; the famous [[IBM (atoms)|Eigler-Schweizer experiment]], precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in ''Nature'' in April 1990; and ''Science'' had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991.  These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman's “Plenty of Room” gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman.

Toumey's analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that “Plenty of Room” did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date.

Feynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past.&lt;ref name=Milburn/&gt; More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President Clinton's January 2000 speech calling for a Federal program:

{{quote|My budget supports a major new National Nanotechnology Initiative, worth $500 million. Caltech is no stranger to the idea of nanotechnology  the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular level. Over 40 years ago, Caltech's own Richard Feynman asked, "What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them?"&lt;ref&gt;Remarks at the California Institute of Technology, January 21, 2000, Public Papers of William J. Clinton, January 1 – June 26, 2000, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the version of the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act that was passed by the House in May 2003 called for a study of the technical feasibility of molecular manufacturing, this study was removed to safeguard funding of less controversial research before the Act was passed by the Senate and finally signed into law by President Bush on December 3, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Ed |last=Regis |date=October  2004|title= The Incredible Shrinking Man | URL = http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/drexler.html?pg=3|journal=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ferguson "Fergie" Reid''' (born March 18, 1925) is a Virginia physician, politician and [[civil rights activist]]. In 1968, Reid became the first [[African-American]] elected to the [[Virginia Assembly]] since the days of [[Civil War (US)|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="virginia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/political/william_reid.htm|title=William Ferguson Reid|work=virginia.gov|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won re-election twice to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], representing Richmond and part of surrounding [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County]].

==Early and family life==
Fergie Reid was born in Richmond on March 18, 1925, the son of dentist Leon Reid and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Stop #12 on [[Maggie Walker]] Tour{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/photosmultimedia/upload/Jackson-Ward-Podcast-transcription.pdf |format=PDF |title=Jackson Ward Podcast |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a house next to that of prominent banker and activist [[Maggie L. Walker]] at 110 Leigh Street in Richmond's [[Jackson Ward]]. Both houses shared the same street number, and one day "a courtly man with a Van Dyke beard" appeared at the Reid family's door, mistaking it for the Walker residence. The stranger proved to be scholar and civil rights activist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Times-Dispatch|first1=JEFF E.

Walker died in 1934, but long remembered her vividly, "She was widowed and living with her children and grandchildren . . . . Naturally we were together every day in our house or their house; so we were very close." He could name Walker's grandchildren-- "Maggie, Laura, Armistead, Mamie Evelyn and Elizabeth"—and that Elizabeth was his age.&lt;ref name="Richmond Times-Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schapio|first1=Jeff E.|title='Miss Maggie' was neighbor of another Va. history-maker|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=July 30, 2017|location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=B1, B10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stop #12 on [[Maggie Walker]] Tour{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/photosmultimedia/upload/Jackson-Ward-Podcast-transcription.pdf |format=PDF |title=Jackson Ward Podcast |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Reid graduated from [[Armstrong High School (Virginia)|Armstrong High School]], and in 1946 he received his bachelor's degree from [[Virginia Union University]]. He earned his medical degree from [[Howard University]], and served his internship and residency as a surgeon in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Dispatch"/&gt;

After the civil rights events described below, Reid and his wife eventually moved to [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Richmond Times-Dispatch"/&gt; Both their daughters and son (William Ferguson Reid, Jr.) became physicians, with the daughters practicing in Maryland and New Jersey and their son in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref name="Dispatch"/&gt; Reid was active in his [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]] and the [[Salvation Army]], as well as with [[Omega Psi Phi]] and became a 32nd degree Mason.&lt;ref name="dela.state.va.us"&gt;http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/94f6e9b9c9b5678f85256b1b00732227/4befa4ea29a5671285256c4c005621c2?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Dr. Reid served as a lieutenant in the [[United States Navy]] during  the [[Korean War]], with the [[1st Marine Division]], and later at the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] in Maryland. Returning to Richmond, he became active in civic and professional affairs. He served on the staff of  Richmond Memorial Hospital, Richmond Community Hospital, Retreat for the Sick, [[Medical College of Virginia]] and [[St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond)|St. Mary's Hospital]]. His professional associations included the [[American College of Surgeons]], [[Richmond Academy of Medicine]], Richmond Medical Society, [[Medical Society of Virginia]], Old Dominion Medical Society, [[American Medical Association]] and the National Medical Association. He became a diplomate of the American Board of Surgery in 1955.&lt;ref name="ABS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Check a certification |url=https://www.absurgery.org/app.jsp?bounce=app_vc_searchvc |publisher=[[American Board of Surgery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights activism==

Reid co-founded the Richmond Crusade for Voters in 1956. He hoped to register and mobilize black voters during [[Massive Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurturing the Roots: 90for90 and Black Political Power|url=http://progressive.org/dispatches/nurturing-roots-90for90-black-political-power/|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=Progressive.org|date=15 July 2016|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[de facto]] member of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Sr.]] and his Democratic political machine in Virginia largely controlled statewide politics. According to Michael Paul Williams of the [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]: "This was an era of poll taxes, literacy tests and other mechanisms to weaken black political clout. The entrenched Byrd [[political machine]] stood in defiance of change."&lt;ref name="Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Michael Paul |title=Dr. William Ferguson Reid |url=https://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/dr-william-ferguson-reid/article_b26338cb-1e2d-5e59-94f9-be5d66da1787.html |accessdate=4 August 2018 |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=10 February 2003 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid, John Mitchell Brooks and Dr. William S. Thornton began meeting daily at the old Slaughter's Hotel, a popular segregation-era gathering place for black Richmonders in [[Jackson Ward]]. The outgrowth of these strategy sessions was the Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/article_b26338cb-1e2d-5e59-94f9-be5d66da1787.html|title=Dr. William Ferguson Reid|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailykos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/19/1377788/-90-for-90-Getting-out-the-vote-in-Virginia#|title=90 for 90. Getting out the vote in Virginia|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans gained national support with the Civil Rights Movement through the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965. An important outcome was Federal oversight and enforcement of voting rights. Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, decisions affecting elections became subject to clearance by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

The Crusade had been formed in 1955 to register more voters to combat the racist politics driven by the era of "[[massive resistance]]," part of a Southern strategy to thwart the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s rulings that public schools be desegregated. "No civic organization did more to democratize local politics in 20th-century Richmond than the Crusade," opined [[University of Richmond]] history professor Dr. Julian Maxwell Hayter in his book, "The Dream Is Lost: Voting Rights and the Politics of Race in Richmond, Virginia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Bonnie Newman|title='We Decided to Start a Third Party'|url=http://richmondmagazine.com/news/sunday-story/we-decided-to-start-a-third-party/|website=richmondmagazine.com|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en-us|date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid co-founded the Richmond Crusade for Voters with Dr. William Thornton, John M. Brooks, Ethel T. Overby and Lola Hamilton.

Despite the Crusade for Voters' continuing growth in influence, Reid's first two candidacies for public office failed. In 1965, he was 7th among the eight candidates seeking the five seats in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] representing Richmond (part-time positions). However, the [[Byrd Organization]] was crumbling. In early 1966, Virginia's [[Harry F. Byrd]] died of a brain tumor, and two of his prominent lieutenants, conservative Democrats, Rep. [[Howard W. Smith]] of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]] and U. S. Senator [[A. Willis Robertson]], lost in the Democratic primary. In the summer of 1969, the Democratic Party engaged in a bitterly fought gubernatorial primary and "an exhausting run-off election which left the old organization fragmented and set the stage for "the election of [[Linwood Holton]]", a Republican who had lost his first gubernatorial run in 1965.&lt;ref name="richmond.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1350&amp;context=masters-theses |format=PDF |title=Linwood Holton's long quest for the governorship of Virginia and its impact on the growth of the Republican Party |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[African American]] to be elected to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] since 1891, Reid took his seat in the lower chamber the following January, alongside [[Eleanor P. Sheppard]], who had opposed school closings and became Richmond's first female mayor. Others winning the nine seats in the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] from Richmond City and [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County-Richmond]] were veterans [[George E. Allen, Jr.]], [[Junie L. Bradshaw]], [[Thomas P. Bryan]], [[Ernst W. Farley, Jr.]], [[Edward E. Lane]], [[E. B. Pendleton, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) p. 749&lt;/ref&gt; Reid replaced prominent segregationist [[T. Coleman Andrews, Jr.]], a prominent segregationist who would found the [[American Independent Party]] in 1969 to support the presidential candidacy of George C. Wallace of Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;New York TImes obituary 4/20/1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1968, Virginians voted in record numbers for the second successive time in a presidential election since adoption of the [[24th Amendment]] removed the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] as a bar to participation in Federal elections.&lt;ref&gt; name="richmond.edu"&lt;/ref&gt; Reid would serve three terms in the [[Virginia General Assembly]], winning re-election in 1969 (when [[Carl E. Bain]] and [[B. Earl Dunn]] replaced Thomas P. Bryan and E.B. Pendleton).&lt;ref&gt;Leonard p. 755&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, after the 1970 census led to legislative reapportionment, [[Robert B. Ball Sr.]], [[Edwin H. Ragsdale]] and [[T. Dix Sutton]] were elected from Henrico County, Reid from the district of Henrico and Richmond City, and Allen, Bain, Lane, Sheppard and newcomer Philip B. Morris represented Richmond City.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard pp. 760, 762&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/HSearch/?SearchView&amp;Query=%5BFullName%5D+Contains+william%20ferguson%20reid+&amp;SearchMax=&amp;SearchOrder=4&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reid was the only African American in the General Assembly when he took office in 1968, in 2000 there were fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Political|first1=Exhibitions:|title=William Ferguson Reid|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/political/william_reid.htm|website=Library of Virginia|publisher=Virginia|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Reid was defeated by colorful Richmond city councilman [[Howard Carwile]], also African-American, who vowed to "raise hell", but was defeated for re-election in 1975 by prominent lawyer [[Gerald L. Baliles]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginius Dabney, Richmond: the Story of a City (University of Virginia Press 1992) pp. 337-338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard pp. 767, 774&lt;/ref&gt;

After his final term as delegate ended, Dr. Reid then accepted a position as regional medical officer with the [[U.S. State Department]], which caused him to maintain a home in Washington, D.C.'s Maryland suburbs, as well as travel abroad. His activism then continued from a distance, as the Crusade for Voters helped win an African American majority on Richmond's City Council and elected [[Henry L. Marsh]] the city's first African American mayor in 1977.&lt;ref name="Dispatch"/&gt; Reid has also recorded an oral history for [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/8 |title=Interview with Dr. W. Ferguson Reid :: Voices of Freedom |publisher=Dig.library.vcu.edu |date=2003-03-21 |accessdate=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Henrico County School Board in 2012 named a school in honor of Dr. William Ferguson Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Michael Paul |title=Williams: Name new Henrico school after Dr. William Ferguson Reid |url=http://www.richmond.com/news/williams-name-new-henrico-school-after-dr-william-ferguson-reid/article_45fa0fb0-164b-559d-b380-7f776c2b6915.html |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=9 October 2012 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==90 for 90 campaign==
In honor of Reid's 90th birthday, in 2015 in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], the 90 for 90 voter registration goal based on door-to-door volunteer canvassing began. The 90 for 90 voter outreach program spread throughout the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] and beyond.&lt;ref name="wsls.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahl |first=Wills |url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/ferguson-reids-movement-can-bring-change-virginia/2015/02/22 |title=Ferguson Reid's movement can bring change to Virginia - Baltimore Post-ExaminerBaltimore Post-Examiner |publisher=Baltimorepostexaminer.com |date=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/04/1375598/-DKos-Asheville-Dr-Fergie-Reid-and-Jr-coming-to-Roanoke# |title=DKos Asheville: Dr. Fergie Reid and Jr coming to Roanoke |publisher=Dailykos.com |date=2015-04-04 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Denise Oliver Valdez wrote for ''[[Daily Kos]]'' that "While much of the media is focusing on presidential hopefuls for 2016, the state of Virginia has key elections coming up this year—elections for the Virginia House of Delegates.... A unique effort is underway in Virginia to get voters registered and out to vote, not just this year, but in the election years to come. The impetus and inspiration behind this drive is a civil rights icon in Virginia, Dr. William Ferguson Reid, known to many as 'Fergie,' who was the first black man to win a seat in the Virginia General Assembly since Reconstruction."&lt;ref name="dailykos.com"/&gt;
