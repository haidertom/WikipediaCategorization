==History==
Aerfer and Fiat merged their aircraft businesses in 1969 to create Aeritalia. The concentration led to milestone programs such as the European attack aircraft Tornado, the ATR family, and the AMX. Aeritalia was also a partner in the Boeing 767 from its inception, and played a key role in the creation of the Italian space industry.

In 1990, Aeritalia merged with [[Selenia (company)|Selenia]] to form [[Alenia Aeronautica]], the aerospace arm of [[Finmeccanica]].

The airline, which effectively replaced the defunct [[Nigeria Airways]], was founded in 2004 as a joint venture between Nigerian investors and the [[Virgin Group]]. Virgin withdrew from the business during 2008-2010. Following two name changes, Air Nigeria announced on 6 September 2012 that it had made its staff redundant and ceased operations on 10 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite web|last=Brock|first=Joe|title=Air Nigeria shuts down in latest aviation setback|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/uk-nigeria-aviation-idUSLNE88901M20120910|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
On 28 September 2004, the Nigerian government and [[Virgin Group]] signed an agreement to establish a new airline for Nigeria, to be called '''Virgin Nigeria Airways'''. Nigerian institutional investors owned 51% of the company and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] the remaining 49%. The airline's inaugural flight was on 28 June 2005 from Lagos to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], using an [[Airbus A340]]-300 aircraft. Virgin Nigeria quickly became one of Nigeria's largest airlines, carrying its 1,000,000th passenger and 4,000th ton of freight within two years of operation. The airline has also received accolades including [[Thisday|THISDAY Awards]] 2006 Airline of the year&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200703260311.html Virgin Nigeria wins 2006 Airline of the Year award.], AllAfrica.com website, retrieved March 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and a nomination for 2006 African Airline of the year by ASATA (Association of South African Travel Agents).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asata.co.za/index.asp Virgin Nigeria nominated for 2006 African Airline of the year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216065030/http://www.asata.co.za/index.asp |date=2007-02-16 }}, Association of South African Travel Agents website, retrieved 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin Nigeria had plans to make [[Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport]] in Abuja its second base, where, in addition to its Lagos base [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]], it would serve all countries in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/virgin-nigeria-buys-bevy-of-embraer-regional-jets/?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=221b1f7da9 Virgin Nigeria buys bevy of Embraer regional jets: AINonline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227095316/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/virgin-nigeria-buys-bevy-of-embraer-regional-jets/?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=221b1f7da9 |date=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nigerian government set a deadline of 30 April 2007 for all airlines operating in the country to re-capitalise or be grounded, in an effort to ensure better services and safety. The airline satisfied the [[Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority]] (NCAA)’s criteria in terms of re-capitalization and was re-registered for operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/NR/exeres/B30C7654-36D9-4C57-837C-1EAB4A103091.htm?id=637 Nigeria Direct] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214021730/http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/NR/exeres/B30C7654-36D9-4C57-837C-1EAB4A103091.htm?id=637 |date=February 14, 2008 }} 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of Virgin's stake and rebranding===
[[File:Nigerian Eagle Airlines logo.png|thumb|Logo used for Nigerian Eagle Airlines.]]
On 19 August 2008, [[Virgin Atlantic]] announced that it was "in talks to sell its 49 percent stake in Virgin Nigeria" and reviewing "whether it is appropriate that the Virgin brand should remain linked to Virgin Nigeria”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ceb26f6e-6e17-11dd-b5df-0000779fd18c.html|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a dispute which arose after Virgin Nigeria's domestic operations were moved against its will by the Ministry of Transportation to Terminal 2. Virgin Nigeria had twice refused the directive to relocate its domestic operations from the international terminal, citing the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding it had signed with the previous ([[Olusegun Obasanjo]]) administration, and pending appeal in a Lagos High court, as reasons for not complying.

On 9 January 2009, Virgin Nigeria announced they would suspend all long haul flights to [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[Johannesburg]], effective 27 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginnigeria.com/en/ng/press/pr2009-01-09.html |title=Flights Have Now Finished |access-date=2009-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603032057/http://www.virginnigeria.com/en/ng/press/pr2009-01-09.html |archive-date=2009-06-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2009, Virgin Nigeria announced on their website they had rebranded as '''Nigerian Eagle Airlines'''. Nigerian Eagle Airlines also stated that they planned to focus on domestic and regional flights with further expansion into [[Europe]] and eventually the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginnigeria.com/en/ng/press/pr2009-09-17.html |title=Virgin Nigeria Rebrand As Nigerian Eagle Airlines |access-date=2009-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214606/http://www.virginnigeria.com/en/ng/press/pr2009-09-17.html |archive-date=2009-09-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin retained its 49% stake in the new Nigerian Eagle Airlines with the remaining 51% held by Nigerian investors.

===Rebranding as Air Nigeria, and cessation of operations ===
On 2 June 2010, following the acquisition of a majority share in the airline, [[Jimoh Ibrahim]], the new [[Chairman]], announced that the airline had undergone a further name change to Air Nigeria Development Limited, branded as '''Air Nigeria'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginnigeria.com/en/ng/press/pr2010-07-02.html |title=Nigerian Eagle Airlines Rebrands As Air Nigeria |access-date=2010-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612161721/http://www.virginnigeria.com/en/ng/press/pr2010-07-02.html |archive-date=2010-06-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 2012, the carrier was grounded by regulators for safety checks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-06/D9VCD5F02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2012 Air Nigeria announced that the management had fired its staff ‘for being disloyal' and the airline ceased all its local, regional, and international operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/news/284-breaking-news/47439-hope-of-air-nigerias-return-dims-as-aoc-expires Hope of Air Nigeria’s return dims as AOC expires]&lt;/ref&gt; Operations ceased on 10 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt;

== Suspension ==
On the 19th of September, 2018, the Nigerian government [https://reportsafrique.com/politics/nigeria-suspends-national-carrier-two-months-after-launch/ suspended the plans to launch the Nigeria air indefinitely]. No concise reasons were given for the suspension.

'''Altice Portugal''' (formerly known as '''Portugal Telecom''' or '''PT''') is the largest [[telecommunications service provider]] in [[Portugal]]. Since June 2, 2015, the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Altice (company)|Altice Group]], a multinational cable and telecommunications company with a presence in France, Israel, Belgium &amp; Luxembourg, Portugal, French West Indies/Indian Ocean Area and Dominican Republic (“Overseas Territories”), Switzerland, and the United States. Its assets in Portugal were sold to [[Altice (company)|Altice]]&lt;ref&gt;[ISIN: LU1014539529]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 in a move of its owner, [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi SA]],&lt;ref&gt;[ISIN: BROIBRACNOR1]&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce debt. The African assets were mostly sold for the same reason. Portugal Telecom, SGPS SA was split in separate companies: PT Portugal (now Altice Portugal) and Pharol (formerly PT SGPS), which owns a 27,5% stake in Oi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/portugal-telecom-holders-approve-sale-of-portuguese-operations-to-altice-1421958476|title=Portugal Telecom Holders Approve Sale of Portuguese Operations to Altice|first=Patricia|last=Kowsmann|date=22 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/oi-approval-by-telemar-participacoes-shareholders-of-the-planned-measures-for-the-transaction-goal-20150401-00016|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com|author=|date=|website=NASDAQ.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first telephone experiments in Portugal connected [[Carcavelos]] to the Central do Cabo in [[Lisbon]], in 1877. In 1882, the [[Edison Gower-Bell Telephone Company of Europe, Ltd.|Edison Gower-Bell Telephone Company]] was established in both Lisbon and [[Porto]], to explore the respective telephone service concessions. In 1887, the concession was transferred to APT - The Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company, which was kept by the latter until 1968, the year in which the Public Company "Telefones de Lisboa e Porto" (TLP) was created. The Post Office, Telegraphs and Telephones ([[CTT]]) explored until this present day, the telephone service in the rest of the country. For the exploration of [[radiotelegraphy]] and [[wireless telephone (disambiguation)|wireless telephone]], a contract with the Marconi's Wireless Telegraphy Company concession was confirmed in 1922. In 1925, the "Companhia Portuguesa Rádio Marconi" (CPRM) was set up and took on all responsibilities of the previous concession.
 
In 1970, CTT became a Public Company and in 1989, the TLP was transformed into a Limited Company, and was completely controlled by the State.

[[File:Cabina telefónica frente a la Catedral de Oporto, Portugal, 2012-05-09, DD 01.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|APT heritage still in use in [[Porto]]]]
In 1992, the Portuguese government and the Public Service Television Corporation [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]] agreed to separate the transmitter network from the rest of the corporation, transferring it to a recently created state-owned company named "Teledifusão de Portugal" (TDP). The purpose of this was to explore a nationwide TV broadcasting network available for any TV station in Portugal to request its services. At the time, RTP (a "native" client of TDP) was having competition for the first time since its creation in the 1950s. [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação|SIC]] required the services of TDP, but [[Televisão Independente|TVI]] decided to create its own transmitter Network (RETI).

In 1992, CTT became a Limited Company with public capital and the Comunicações Nacionais, SPGS, SA (CN) was created, a state holding company responsible for the managing of all state participation within the sector - CTT, TLP, CPRM e TDP. In this same year, the Telecommunications developed by CTT was automatized through the creation of Telecom Portugal, SA, giving CTT the possibility to dedicate itself exclusively to the Post Office. With this, Portugal had its own telecommunications network which was being explored by 3 operators: the TLP explored the telephone services in the Lisbon and Porto areas, Telecom Portugal was responsible for the remaining national, European and Mediterranean communications; and Marconi took hold of international traffic. In 1994, a unique national telecommunications operator was created with the fusion of companies within the CN State holding: Portugal Telecom, SA (PT), with the fusion of Telecom Portugal, TLP and TDP.

Portugal Telecom was the only telephone operator in Portugal, being a [[monopoly]], until 1994, when the government gradually retired its control over the corporation and, in 2000, Portugal Telecom became a publicly owned company. Since then, it has held a dominant position in the liberalized Portuguese market.

In early 2007, the Portuguese conglomerate, [[Sonae]]'s [[takeover]] offer for Portugal Telecom failed. PT's board rejected an initial bid, worth EUR 11.1 bn, in February 2006. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposed [[Belmiro de Azevedo]] (founder and historical chairman of [[Sonae]] holding company) and his son Paulo Azevedo (then the head officer of [[Sonae.com]] telecommunications operator) to the investor [[José Berardo]] and PT's administrators Zeinal Bava and Henrique Granadeiro.{{clarify|date=July 2011}} In April 2007 the [[European Commission]] gave an ultimatum to the [[Portuguese government]] ordering it to give up on the 500 [[golden share]]s pack that it owned on the company and that enable special veto powers to the government on vital issues. This could give the government a decisive role in the bid by any company to buy Portugal Telecom. In November 2007, Portugal Telecom spun off its media assets ([[PT Multimédia]]), that included [[TV Cabo]] and [[Lusomundo]] Cinemas. In January 2008, the [[European Commission]] began legal proceedings against the Portuguese government over its 'golden share' in incumbent telecoms operator Portugal Telecom. The 500 golden shares with extended voting rights, allowing it to block potential takeover bids, were the reason for the Commission's legal action. Similarly, in November 2005, the Commission had forced the [[Spanish government]] to give up its golden share in the other telecommunications' major player in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the Spanish telecoms giant [[Telefónica]].

In December 2009, Portugal Telecom purchased RETI.

In October 2, 2013, Portugal Telecom and Brazil's [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]] said they would combine operations to form a new Brazil-based company with more than 100 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304906704579110693710265598| title=Portugal Telecom and Brazil's Oi to Merge | work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting company's provisional name is CorpCo.

Armando Almeida replaced Zeinal Bava at the helm of Portugal Telecom on August 18, 2014. Zeinal Bava skipped off to Oi in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://algarvedailynews.com/news/3442-portugal-telecom-s-new-chief-to-put-customers-first Portugal Telecom’s new chief 'to put customers first'], Algarve Daily News (18-09-2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2015, [[Altice (company)|Altice Group]] announced closing of Portugal Telecom acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://altice.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/altice-portugal-telecom-Closing-Announcement-150602.pdf|title = Altice announces closing of Portugal Telecom Acquisition|last = |first = |date = June 2, 2015|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date= June 2, 2015 | publisher= [[Agence France-Presse]] and [[Business Insider]]| title=Altice finalises acquisition of Portugal Telecom| access-date=August 1, 2015| url= http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-altice-finalises-acquisition-of-portugal-telecom-2015-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paulo Neves|Paulo Manuel da Conceição Neves]] was appointed as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.telecompaper.com/news/pt-portugal-names-new-management--1091417|title = PT Portugal names new management|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2017, Paulo Neves resigns as CEO and it was replaced by Alexandre Filipe Fonseca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://expresso.sapo.pt/economia/2017-11-21-Altice-Paulo-Neves-sai-da-PT-Alexandre-Fonseca-confirmado-como-presidente-executivo#gs.oQptCEY|title = Altice: Paulo Neves sai da PT, Alexandre Fonseca confirmado como presidente executivo|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

===Domestic===

Altice owns [[MEO (Portugal)|MEO]], the largest [[landline]] operator in Portugal.&lt;ref name="Corp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecom.pt/InternetResource/PTSite/UK/Canais/Investidores/Grupo/Estrutura+do+Grupo/estruturacorp.htm|title=Corporate structure|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Portugal Telecom|accessdate=23 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67DQ5lp2N?url=http://www.telecom.pt/InternetResource/PTSite/UK/Canais/Investidores/Grupo/Estrutura+do+Grupo/estruturacorp.htm|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its operating brands include [[Meo (Portugal)|MEO]], a [[quadruple play]] service provider and [[SAPO (company)|SAPO]], an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] and producer of web content. Portugal Telecom also owns Altice Labs (formerly known as PT Inovação), an [[Information technology|IT services]] and [[research and development]] company; PT Contact, focused in the business of managing [[Contact centre (business)|contact centres]].

=== International ===

Portugal Telecom does not run any international operations, since all have been transferred to [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]], in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi/emitentes/docs/fr49864.pdf|title = Oi capital increase|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brazil]] was Portugal Telecom's second-largest market. PT agreed to acquire 22.4% of [[Oi (telecommunications)|Telemar Norte Leste (Oi)]], the country's largest telecommunications firm, in July 2010.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Minder|first=Raphael|title=Telefónica Wins Full Control of Brazil Phone Venture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/technology/29vivo.html|accessdate=31 July 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately it also had 29% of [[Universo Online|UOL]], a major Brazil-based ISP and [[online service provider]]; and was the sole owner of Dedic, a [[call centre]] operator.&lt;ref name="Corp" /&gt; PT previously held 29.7% of [[Vivo S.A.|Vivo]], the country's largest mobile phone network, which it controlled jointly with [[Telefónica]]. It agreed however to sell its stake to Telefónica for €7.5 billion in July 2010.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Portugal Telecom's other main international assets were based in Africa and Asia, largely in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking nations. Through a 75%-owned investment [[holding company]] Africatel, PT had an effective 18.75% of [[Angola]]'s largest mobile operator Unitel; 30% of Cabo Verde Telecom (CVT) of [[Cape Verde]]; 38.25% of Companhia Santomense de Telecomunicações (CST) of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]; and 25.5% of the [[Namibia]]n mobile firm [[MTC Namibia|MTC]].&lt;ref name="Corp" /&gt; The firm sold a 32% shareholding in [[Méditel]] of Morocco in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUKL156934420090901|title=Portugal Telecom, Telefonica sell Meditel stakes|last=Tavares|first=Elisabete|author2=Khalip, Andrei |author3=MacInnes, Judy |date=1 September 2009|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Asia]] Portugal Telecom owned 41.1% of Timor Telecom of [[East Timor]].

== Ownership ==
Altice Portugal is no longer a [[public company|publicly traded company]], since 100% of its capital is owned by [[Altice (company)|Altice Group]].

As of 15 November 2011 its major stockholders were [[Espírito Santo Financial Group]] (11.30%), RS Holding (10.05%), [[Capital Group Companies|Capital Research and Management]] (9.97%), [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi;k]] (7.00%), [[Caixa Geral de Depósitos]] (6.23%), [[Brandes Investment Partners]] (5.24%) and [[Norges Bank]] (5.01%).

After privatization the [[Portuguese government]] owned 500 [[golden share]]s in PT, which carried special rights over the company's management decisions and blocked any one shareholder from holding more than 10% of voting rights within the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0a51e156-bd5e-11db-b5bd-0000779e2340.html|title=Sonaecom lifts Portugal Telecom bid|last=Wise|first=Peter|date=16 February 2007|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=23 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609063923/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0a51e156-bd5e-11db-b5bd-0000779e2340.html|archive-date=2011-06-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden shares were the subject of a long running dispute between the government and the [[European Commission]], which alleged that their existence was illegal under [[European Union law|EU law]]. Portugal argued that the shares were in the [[public interest]]. A case brought before the [[European Court of Justice]] by the Commission to force the government to cede its shares resulted in the announcement of their abolition in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goncalves|first=Sergio|title=Portugal scraps golden shares in utilities|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/05/portugal-goldenshares-idUSLDE76414L20110705|accessdate=18 November 2011|date=5 July 2011|author2=Alvarenga, Daniel|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2013 it was reported that Portugal Telecom and Brazil's Oi are to Merge to create a Brazil-based company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Portugal Telecom and Brazil's Oi to Merge |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304906704579110693710265598|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=2 October 2013|author1=PATRICIA KOWSMANN |author2=ROGERIO JELMAYER|agency=[[Wall Street Journal]]|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2, 2015, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Altice (company)|Altice Group]], a multinational cable and telecommunications company with a presence in France, Israel, Belgium &amp; Luxembourg, Portugal, French West Indies/Indian Ocean Area and Dominican Republic (“Overseas Territories”) and Switzerland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2045">'''Andrea Mazzucchi''' (born March 19, 1966) in [[Rome]] is an [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] entrepreneur, network architect, and computer specialist

He played a significant role in the early development of Internet in [[Italy]], and other countries in Eastern Europe, such as [[Croatia]].

Being interested in the regulatory side, as well as the technical, he also played a key role in the Internet governance of Italy since 1985. He co-founded,  in 1998, the [[ccTLD]] ".it" policy board (Naming Authority), where he eventually became Chair of the Board of Directors. In 2004, once the Naming Authority evolved into the Rules Committee, he was one of the appointed members.

Focused since the very beginning toward the [[Open Source]], in 1992 he co-founded Nexus, the first [[ISP]] in Italy based exclusively on [[Linux]] and open technologies.

In 1993, Mazzucchi co-founded Gedi, one of the first companies in Italy for [[distance learning]].

In 1995, he founded Istria On Line, the first ISP in Croatia, and worked on Internet pilot projects in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Hungary]], mostly establishing [[TCP/IP]] over [[X.25]] Internet connections for international businesses.

Bianchi graduated from [[Stanford University]] and [[California Polytechnic State University]] where she majored in communications and [[political science]], with the original intention of working for the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adotas.com/2006/01/tbwachiatdays-carisa-bianchi-lives-in-perpetual-moti/&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find a suitable position in the CIA, she joined the advertising firm of [[Benton &amp; Bowles]] in Los Angeles, working on [[Continental Airlines]] and Homes Savings of America. After two years, she left to join [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]], working on GTE and The Southern California Gas Company. In 1989, she joined Chiat\Day Los Angeles, where she spent eight years working with clients such as [[Energizer Batteries]], [[Sony PlayStation]], Cherry Coke and Sparkletts bottled water. Under her guidance, the [[Energizer Bunny]] campaign became one of the most successful advertising campaigns in U.S. history. The Sony PlayStation was also one of the most successful platform launches in the history of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i20events.com/speakers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925204630/http://www.i20events.com/speakers.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Bianchi became the Managing Director of the newly re-opened TBWA\Chiat\Day office in San Francisco. In 2001, she was named one of [[Advertising Age]]’s "Women to Watch". She moved back to Los Angeles in 2002 to become Chief Strategy Officer, overseeing all strategic initiatives, including Account Planning, Business Development and the Disruption and Connections initiative. In 2005, she was promoted to President of the Los Angeles office. In her first year as president, the agency launched The Disruption Consultancy, won the [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] account, won a record number of Grand [[EFFIE]]s and was named Adweek’s Agency of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effie.org/about/global_committee/bianchi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616214548/http://www.effie.org/about/global_committee/bianchi |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Continued process verification''' (CPV) is the collection and analysis of end-to-end production components and processes data to ensure product outputs are within predetermined quality limits. In 2011 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Process Validation: General Principles and Practices |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf |publisher=FDA |accessdate= 3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlining best practices regarding business process validation in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Continued process verification is outlined in this report as the third stage in [[process validation]]. Its central purpose is to ensure that processes are in a constant state of control, thus ensuring final product quality. Central to effective CPV is a method with which to identify unwanted process inconsistencies in order to execute corrective or preventative measures. Once quality standards are set in place they must be monitored with regular frequency to confirm those parameters are being met. Continued process verification not only helps protect consumers from production faults, but business also see benefits in implementing a CPV program. Should product outputs not match target standards it can be very costly to investigate the problem source without existing CPV data.

==Vital components of continued process verification==
* An alert system to identify process malfunctions that lead to deviations from quality standards. 
* A framework for gathering and analyzing data of final product quality and process consistency.  Analysis should include source materials consistency and manufacturing equipment condition; and data should be collected in a format that allows for long term trend analysis as well as intra-production quality analysis.
* Continued review of quality qualification standards and process reliability. Departures from any predetermined standards should be flagged for review by trained personnel and appropriate measures undertaken to restore end-to-end quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trust but Verify (Continuously)|url=http://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM%20Articles/ART-Trust-but-Verify.pdf|publisher=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection and analysis==
Crucial in effective CPV implementation is an appropriate data collection procedure. Data must allow for statistical analytics and trend analysis of process consistency and capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continued Process Verification (CPV)|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/216.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correctly implemented procedure will minimize overreactions to individual production outlier events and guarantee genuine process inconsistency are detected. While production variability can sometimes be obvious and even casually identified the FDA recommends using statistical tools to quantitatively detect problems and identify root causes. Initially, continued process verification should be based on quality standards established in the design phase. After a period of time variations can be detected by identifying deviation from historical data using statistical tools. Furthermore, these same tools can also be used to identify opportunities to optimize processes that may pre-emptively increase quality reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Case for Stage 3 Continued Process Verification|url=http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2014/stage3-continued-process-verification|publisher=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dal Negro''' is an Italian company that produces playing cards, tarot cards, divination cards, chess, backgammon, roulette wheels, and toys for children.

The company has its registered office, from 2002, in Carbonera in the Treviso area.

Its origins date back to 1756, as a factory of playing cards, owned by an Austrian situated in the city of Treviso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Del Negro e Modiano, destini opposti complice la concorrenza del web|url=http://www.ilgazzettino.it/CULTURA/modiano_dal_negro_carte_trieste_treviso_de_toffoli_gioco_carte/notizie/409836.shtml|accessdate=February 18, 2014|journal=Il Gazzetino|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased in 1928 by Dal Negro family. For decades it had several locations in the town of Treviso, before arriving in the new location. In 2003, it bought rival Masenghini but has kept the brands separate. The following year, it acquired Milan-based NTP, which produces plastic playing cards.

In recent years the company has increased the production of Tarot decks, which also include a deck made by the Nobel Prize for Literature, [[Dario Fo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2531">'''External risks''' are generally something that is uncontrollable by the first party.

==In contract law==
In [[contract law]], are risks that are produced by a non-human source and are beyond [[human]] control. They are unexpected but happen regularly enough in a general population to be broadly predictable, and may be the subject of [[casualty insurance]].
Good examples of external risks are [[natural disasters]] such as [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanoes]].

[[Insurance]] adjusters analyze external risks on a normal basis. Measuring risks of the environment is common practice throughout [[insurance claims]]. As far as claims go, most external risks, or an "[[Act of God]]", are protected by [[property insurance]].

==In project management==
In [[project management]]; Risks that are external to the project and the project manager cannot control.
Good examples of external risks are changes in government [[legislation]], changes in [[strategy]] from senior managers, and the [[economy]].

==Common examples&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|title=External Events
|journal=Information Security Handbook
|url=http://ishandbook.bsewall.com/risk/Assess/Risk/External_Events.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
* [[Hurricanes]]
* [[Earthquakes]]
* [[Tornadoes]]
* [[Floods]]
* Volcanic Eruptions
* [[Lightning]]
* [[Fire]]
* [[Disease]] (such as pandemics/epidemics)
* Environmental Hazards (pollution)
* Civil Disruptions (vandalism, terrorism)

==Assessing external risks==
Three separate aspects should be analyzed when determining the amount of external risk that exists.

# '''Frequency of Occurrence''' - What are the odds of an external risk occurring in your situation? Do similar risk situations happen often in your area? This assesses the probability of the external risk.
# '''Duration of the Occurrence''' - Over what time period will the external risk last? How long will the affected party be at an altered state due to this risk? This assesses the amount of time that would be lost due to the risk and its effects.
# '''Loss of Assets''' - What types of property could be damaged or destroyed from this risk? This assesses the state of property and assets after the external risk occurs.

== Background ==
Gudkov received a degree in languages from Kolomna State Pedagogical Institute in 1978.&lt;ref name=Gudkov /&gt;&lt;ref name=E /&gt; He joined the [[KGB]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s national security agency, in 1981, working there for the next decade and finishing at the rank of lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/09/russian-politics |title=Why Gennady Gudkov was expelled from the Duma |author=J.Y. |date=17 September 2012 |work=The Economist |archivedate=28 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjzfhmNG?url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/09/russian-politics |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later held a post in the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/russia-expels-anti-putin-lawmaker-whos-next-113639782.html |title=Russia expels anti-Putin lawmaker; who's next? |author=Nataliya Vasilyeva |date=14 September 2012 |agency=Associated Press |archivedate=28 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bk4nAb1B?url=http://news.yahoo.com/russia-expels-anti-putin-lawmaker-whos-next-113639782.html |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duma career ==
Gudkov was first elected to the [[State Duma]] in a by-election of the Kolomna 106th District on 18 March 2001, joining the [[People's Party of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name=Gudkov /&gt;&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; Gudkov won the seat again in the [[Russian legislative election, 2003|2003]] and [[Russian legislative election, 2007|2007 legislative elections]].&lt;ref name=Gudkov /&gt;

Gudkov was serving as deputy chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Security during the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], in which 40-50 [[Chechnya|Chechen]] Islamist separatists took over a theater holding 850 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68949717.html |title=Rebels Threaten Hostages in Moscow |author=Eric Engleman |date=24 October 2002 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He blamed the failure of security forces to prevent the attack on a systematic destruction of state security institutions following the fall of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-392403.html |title=Putin Takes Hard Line on Terror, Stays Silent on Use of Deadly Gas; Russian Leader Vows to Pursue Chechens' Sponsors and Financial Backers |author=Peter Baker and Susan B. Glasser |date=29 October 2002 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he denied allegations that Russia was responsible for the death of former Chechen president [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]], stating that the KGB's overseas assassination squad had long been disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-113662600.html |title=Two Russian Agents Charged in Death of Former Chechen President |author=Mark McDonald |date=27 February 2004 |publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2004 Nazran raid|Nazran raid]], in which Chechen rebels killed 90 people at police facilities in [[Ingushetia]], Gudkov supported President Vladimir Putin's firings of top military officials, stating, "[t]he general staff made serious mistakes regarding the military structures' actions in Chechnya."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-96576425.html |title=Russian President Shakes Up Top Military |author=Maria Danilova |date=19 July 2004 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "This will go on until we ourselves learn how to prevent terrorist acts, until we learn how to carry out effective operations to destroy terrorists"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-199818.html |title=Chechen Conflict Now Rages Beyond Russia's Expectations |author=David E. Hoffman |date=28 October 2012 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for better pay for security forces to attract better quality personnel and prevent corruption, stating that the latter may have contributed to the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-100393466.html |title=Analysis: Inefficiency and corruption bedevil attempts to prevent more terrorist attacks in Russia |author=Robert Siegel |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=National Public Radio {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported a law allowing undercover security officers to commit illegal acts such as buying guns or drugs in the course of their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-102261039.html |title=Bill Lets Undercover Police to Break the Law |author=Oksana Yablokova |date=9 November 2004 |work=St. Petersburg Times |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to Putin ===
In March 2004, following a weak performance by the People's Party in the recent legislative elections, Gudkov succeeded {{Interlanguage link multi|Gennady Raikov|2=ru|3=Райков, Геннадий Иванович|preserve=1}} as chairman of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93035818.html |title=Unsuccessful Parties Turn on Leaders |author=Oksana Yablokova |date=31 March 2004 |work=The Moscow Times |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gudkov later became a member of Putin's [[United Russia]] party,&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; before switching in 2007 to the populist [[Just Russia]] party, many of whose members oppose Putin.&lt;ref name=E /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-302699576.html |title=Russian Duma expels anti-Putin lawmaker. Sign of a coming crackdown? |author=Fred Weir |date=14 September 2012 |work=The Christian Science Monitor |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, he criticized a bill supported by United Russia allowing [[Gazprom]], [[Transneft]], and other corporations to train and arm private security forces, calling it a [[Pandora's box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169310021.html |title=Moscow's mercenaries |date=1 September 2007 |work=Foreign Policy |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, he complained that United Russia "will not allow opponents" and that Russia was becoming a [[one-party state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169843507.html |title=Power To The Party |author=Owen Matthews and Anna Nemtsova |date=22 October 2007 |work=Newsweek |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2008, he sought to amend and clarify a Duma bill greatly expanding the definition of treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-159354047.html |title=Familiar fear as Russia redefines treason Law could silence government critics |author=Michael Schwirtz |date=22 December 2008 |work=International Herald Tribune |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, he criticized legislation by [[Dmitry Medvedev]] to ban political parties with less than a 7% nationwide vote from parliament, saying that "only an incorrigible optimist could consider that a pro-democracy move".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D976EC7G2.html |title=Minor parties may get nominal Duma seats |date=27 March 2009 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Gudkov said that due to lack of free debate, "a huge negative energy among the public ready to explode any moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-269453816.html |title=Back to the U.S.S.R |author=Owen Matthews and Anna Nemtsova |date=17 October 2011 |work=Newsweek |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following month, he broke ranks with his party's moderate criticism of Putin and warned that major street protests could result if United Russia committed electoral fraud in the impending election.&lt;ref name=R/&gt; In the speech, Gudkov stated that "our elections are a mix of abuse of administrative resources and work going ahead at full speed to ensure falsification". Footage of the speech became a popular video on Russian blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30139976.html |title=Shocked Putin greeted with boos and jeers at the big fight |date=22 November 2011 |work=The Independent |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next year, Gudkov became a frequent participant and leader in public [[2011–2012 Russian protests|protests against Putin]].&lt;ref name=E /&gt; In January 2012, a secret recording of a conversation between Gudkov and politician [[Vladimir Ryzhkov]] was released in which the two appeared to discuss how to undermine other anti-Putin forces; the two called it a plot to sow distrust between opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30530249.html |title=Putin in broadside against his critics and opponents |author=Daniel McLaughlin |date=20 January 2012 |work=The Irish Times |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Gudkov's son [[Dmitry Gudkov]], also a Duma deputy, led a [[filibuster]] against a bill allowing large fines for anti-government protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/world/europe/ponomarev-works-to-change-russia-from-the-inside.html?_r=0 |title=Working Russia’s Streets, and Its Halls of Power |author=David M.

Following Gudkov's opposition, his private security firm, Oskord, became the target of "a campaign of raids and investigations from a variety of bodies, from the fire department to the Moscow architectural committee". Permission for its guards to carry firearms was revoked, making its usual security operations difficult. Gudkov estimated in July that he had lost 40% of his business.&lt;ref name=E2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-295314886.html |title=Gudkovs, bad cops; Russian politics |date=7 July 2012 |work=The Economist |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expulsion from Duma ==
In August 2012, a special committee of the Duma was formed to investigate allegations that Gudkov had violated parliamentary rules by making money from the construction firm Kolomensky Stroitel while also holding his seat.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/15/world/la-fg-russia-opposition-20120915 |title=Russian opposition lawmaker ousted from parliament |author=Sergei L. Loiko |date=27 October 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |archivedate=28 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bk210U7P?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/15/world/la-fg-russia-opposition-20120915 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Prosecutor General]] and [[Investigative Committee of Russia|Investigative Committee]] presented evidence that Gudkov had broken anti-corruption laws, and the minutes of a Kolomensky Stroitel meeting with Gudkov's signature was given as evidence of his business activity.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

On 15 September 2012, Gudkov was stripped of his seat in the Duma by a vote of 291 to 150. Gudkov called the vote a farce, saying "This is a reprisal. It is not a court."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19601752 |title=Russian Duma expels anti-Putin MP Gennady Gudkov |date=14 September 2012 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=28 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bk2J5OfD?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19601752 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Just Russia party leader [[Sergei Mironov]] described Gudkov's expulsion as "unlawful revenge".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; [[United Russia]] Deputy [[Andrei Isayev]] stated that Gudkov had to be stripped of his seat, arguing, "People expect fairness: Everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. We cannot undermine that hope of our people."&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

Analysts described the vote as part of a broader crackdown against Putin's critics, noting the recent charges against anti-corruption activist [[Alexey Navalny]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=R&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/unlikely-putin-foe-faces-ouster-russia-assembly-093756790.html |title=Unlikely Putin foe faces ouster from Russia assembly |author=Alissa de Carbonnel |agency=Reuters |date=6 September 2012 |publisher=Yahoo! |archivedate=28 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bk4QUfck?url=http://news.yahoo.com/unlikely-putin-foe-faces-ouster-russia-assembly-093756790.html |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/world/europe/anti-putin-protesters-march-in-moscow-russia.html?_r=1 |title=Undaunted by Arrests, the Opposition Marches Against Putin |author1=Ellen Barry |authorlink=Ellen Barry (journalist) |author2=David Herszenhorn |date=15 September 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that "like, in a way, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the question is not whether Mr Gudkov ran afoul of Russian law but rather why Russian law seems to matter so little to his peers who keep themselves in the Kremlin’s better graces."&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

'''''Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't''''' is a management book by [[Jim C. Collins]] that describes how companies transition from being good companies to great companies, and how most companies fail to make the transition. The book was published on October 16, 2001. "Greatness" is defined as financial performance several multiples better than the market average over a sustained period. Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. Collins finds the main reason certain companies become great is they narrowly focus the company’s resources on their field of key competence.

The book was a bestseller, selling four million copies and going far beyond the traditional audience of business books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryant|first=Adam|title=For This Guru, No Question Is Too Big|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/business/24collins.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Collins used a large team of researchers who studied "6,000 articles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project".&lt;ref name=pw/&gt; Top members of this research team were:

* Brian J.Bagley
* Lane Hornung
* Vicki Mosur Osgood
* Scott Cederberg
* Christine Jones
* Alyson Sinclair
* Anthony J.Chirikos
* Scott Jones
* Peter Van Genderen
* Jenni Cooper
* Stefanie A.Judd
* Paul Weissman
* Duane C.Duffy
* Brian C.Larsen
* Leigh Wilbanks
* Eric Hagen
* Weijia (Eve) Li
* Amber L.Young
* Morten T.Hansen
* Nicholas M.Osgood

==Seven characteristics of companies that went from "good to great"==
* Level 5 Leadership: Leaders who are humble, but driven to do what's best for the company.
* First Who, Then What: Get the right people on the bus, then figure out where to go. Find the right people and try them out in different seats on the bus (different positions in the company).
* Confront the Brutal Facts: The [[Stockdale paradox]]—Confront the brutal truth of the situation, yet at the same time, never give up hope.
* Hedgehog Concept: Three overlapping circles: What lights your fire ("passion")? What could you be best in the world at ("best at")? What makes you money ("driving resource")? 
* Culture of Discipline: Rinsing the cottage cheese.
* Technology Accelerators: Using technology to accelerate growth, within the three circles of the hedgehog concept.
* The Flywheel: The additive effect of many small initiatives; they act on each other like compound interest.

==Great companies==
Collins finds eleven examples of "great companies" and comparators, similar in industry-type and opportunity, but which failed to achieve the good-to-great growth shown in  the great companies:

{|
|+
| '''Great Company''' || '''Comparator'''
|-
| [[Abbott Laboratories]]                                       || [[Upjohn]]
|-
| [[Circuit City Stores]]                                       || [[Silo (store)|Silo]]
|-
| [[Fannie Mae]]                                                || [[Great Western Bank]]

|-
| [[Kimberly-Clark]]                                            || [[Scott Paper Company]]
|-

|-
| [[Nucor]]                                                     || [[Bethlehem Steel]]

|-
| [[Pitney Bowes]]                                              || [[Addressograph]]
|-
| [[Walgreens]]                                                 || [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd]]
|-
| [[Wells Fargo]]                                               || [[Bank of America]] 
|}

==Unsustained Companies==
Collins includes 6 examples of companies that did not sustain their change to greatness. These companies, "... are looked at separately as a clump":&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audiobooks.com/audiobook/good-to-great-why-some-companies-make-the-leap-and-others-dont/83046&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''Unsustained Comparisons'''

| [[Chrysler]]
|-
| [[Harris Corporation|Harris]]
|-
| [[Hasbro]]
|-
| [[Rubbermaid]]
|-
| [[Teledyne]]

==Response==
The book was "cited by several members of [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s CEO Council as the best management book they've read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Alan Murray | title=The Wall Street Journal Essential Guide to Management | publisher=New York: HarperCollins | year=2010 | pages=11 | isbn=978-0-06-184033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it "worthwhile", although "many of Collins' perspectives on running a business are amazingly simple and commonsense".&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite news|title=GOOD TO GREAT: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... And Others Don't (Review)|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-662099-2|accessdate=2012-07-13|date=September 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Holt and Cameron state the book provides a "generic business recipe" that ignores "particular strategic opportunities and challenges."&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas |last2=Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title=Cultural Strategy |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven D. Levitt]] noted that some of the companies selected as "great" have since gotten into serious trouble, such as [[Circuit City]] and [[Fannie Mae]], while only [[Nucor]] had "dramatically outperformed the stock market" and "Abbott Labs and Wells Fargo have done okay". He further states that investing in the portfolio of the 11 companies covered by the book, in the year of 2001, would actually result in ''underperforming'' the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.asmartbear.com/business-advice-plagued-by-survivor-bias.html&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt concludes that books like this are "mostly backward-looking" and can't offer a guide for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitt|first=Steven D.|title=From Good to Great … to Below Average|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2008/07/28/from-good-to-great-to-below-average/|work=Freakonomics|date=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins reaffirmed that "The books never promised that these companies would always be great, just that they were once great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/by-the-book/2009/09/paranoia_your_best_friend.html|date=September 14, 2009|title=Paranoia: Your Best Friend|author=Clint Greenleaf|publisher=''[[Inc.

In his speech, he defended the National Fund of Kazakhstan's management of revenues from Kazakhstan's petroleum production and he criticised a book published by the OSI with the same title as his speech referring, in particular, to 40 factual "mistakes" found by him in said book.&lt;ref name=SPEECH&gt;[http://www.homestead.com/prosites-kazakhembus/051403.html Marchenko Says National Fund Transparent, Criticizes New Book for Conceptual "Mistakes"] Embassy of Kazakhstan to the USA and Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchenko specifically took issue with the allegations that the Kazakhstan Government established the fund on a questionable legal basis, citing 30 amendments to several laws passed by [[Parliament of Kazakhstan|the Parliament]] regarding financial accountability, the fact that [[List of Presidents of Kazakhstan|President]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has complete control over the fund, calling it "simply wrong" that the book refers to "the [[Russia]]n [[Black Sea]] port of [[Ceyhan]]" which is in fact a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[port]], but not, as asserted in the book, a Russian port. In conclusion, Marchenko proposed "that the book be recalled, and the chapter on Kazakhstan be rewritten." George Soros invited Marchenko to point out the mistakes he had found and undertook that these mistakes would be corrected.&lt;ref name=SPEECH/&gt;

Marchenko met with [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] and Putin's economic advisor [[Andrei Ilarianov]], in May 2003. After the meeting there were rumors in the media that Putin had offered Marchenko a job in the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name=BANKING/&gt;

'''Guillermo Alberto Santiago Lasso Mendoza''' (born 16 November 1955) is an [[Ecuador]]ian businessman and politician. In the [[Ecuadorian general election, 2013]] he was presidential candidate for the party [[Creating Opportunities]].&lt;ref name=creo&gt;[http://www.ecuadortimes.net/2012/11/14/creo-enrolled-lasso-solines-binomial/ CREO enrolled Lasso-Solines binomial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In that case the opposition should unite around a single candidate who, according to ARCOP, would be Guillermo Lasso, with 26% of voter preference in the same survey." [http://www.ecuadortimes.net/2013/02/04/correas-reelection-is-uncertain/ Correa’s reelection is uncertain]&lt;/ref&gt; He landed in second place with 22.68% of valid votes but as incumbent President [[Rafael Correa]] received more than double that amount, namely 57.17%. Lasso is, through a trust named with his initials, GLM, the largest share holder in Banco de Guayaquil, where he has been executive president for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Weisbrot: [http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/325442-media-cant-ignore-financial-scandal-in-ecuadors-presidential Media can't ignore financial scandal in Ecuador's presidential election], TheHill, 24. March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, Lasso launched his second presidential campaign to succeed incumbent President Correa for the conservative [[Creating Opportunities]] party in the [[Ecuadorian general election, 2017|2017 presidential elections]], as Correa had already served his two-term constitutionally defined limit. His campaign's theme was one of "change" and he pledged to create one million more jobs in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecuadorinmediato.com/index.php?module=Noticias&amp;func=news_user_view&amp;id=2818813638&amp;umt=guillermo_lasso_inicia_su_campaf1a_electoral_visitando_puerta_a_puerta_a_ciudadanos_en_guayaquil Guillermo Lasso inicia su campaña electoral visitando puerta a puerta a ciudadanos en Guayaquil], ecuadorinmediato.com, 2017-01-03 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Lasso received 48.84% and lost to  [[Lenín Moreno]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Ecuadors-Right-Wing-Opposition-Doesnt-Show-Up-to-Public-Recount-it-Demanded-20170418-0015.html Lenin Again Wins Ecuador's Presidential Race After Recount], teleSUR English, 18 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Lasso said in an interview with a British newspaper that in case of his victory in the presidential election he would “cordially ask” [[Julian Assange]], the [[WikiLeaks]] founder, to leave the Ecuadorian Embassy in London within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-notice-eviction Ecuador presidential hopeful promises to evict Julian Assange from embassy], The Guardian, 9. February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to information from the Inspectorate of Banks of [[Panamá]], revealed by the Argentine newspaper [[Página 12]], Guillermo Lasso is associated with forty-nine offshore companies located in tax havens. His fortune would have jumped from $1 million to $31 million between 1999 and 2002, after his brief passage to the government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pagina12.com.ar/25889-lasso-el-magnate-de-las-offshore&lt;/ref&gt;

== Firma Gustav Baumhöfer  ==

[[File:Main Building and extention of "Firma Gustav Baumhoefer".jpg|thumbnail|Main building and extension of "Firma Gustav Baumhoefer"]]

After World War II already on June 15, 1945, Gustav Baumhoefer founded in his home town [[Versmold]] a shoe factory that was specialized on men's shoes and boots.  First producing on the premisses of the ''Metall und Leder'' company a new main building with a factory hall was set up in 1949.  The brand name was "Ravensberger Schuhe" and became widely known.  In 1957 he expanded briefly by acquiring a second production facility as separate company in [[Werl-Aspe]], [[Schoetmar]], today [[Bad Salzuflen]].  In the late 1970s due to changes in the world market and an increasing pressure by import of shoes, the company became unprofitable.  A year after his death the factory was shut down, and only a shoe retail shop originally connected with the factory continued to operate until the 1990s.

The factory's main building from 1949 and its later extension of a sewing hall from the mid 1950s are still standing in Versmold. Its architecture is almost the last surviving witness for the city's proud economic blossoming after World War II. Since 1982 the complex served different purposes, as printing factory, as wine depot, and thrift store. In March 2015 it was announced that the main building and factory hall of 'Baumhoefer' will be used as a first respond shelter for arriving asylum applicants. Between August 2015 and March 2016 it served up to 180 refugees at the same time. Currently it is the home for a number of refugee families. The re-purposing caused serious interventions into the historical substance of the building.

'''IQTELL''' was a productivity app that allowed users to manage email, tasks, projects, calendars, contacts, [[Evernote|Evernotes]] and more in a single app.  IQTELL was available as a web app, as well as an [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app. All user information was automatically synced between all devices. iOS and Android apps supported offline access. The app could be used to implement concepts and techniques described in the book ''[[Getting Things Done]]'' by David Allen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/iqtell-puts-gtd-notes-and-email-in-a-single-productivi-1539006627 "IQTELL Puts GTD, Notes and Email in a Single Productivity App"]. ''Lifehacker''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IQTELL was created by Ran Flam&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baselinemag.com/careers/slideshows/how-to-deal-with-email-when-youre-on-vacation.html "How to Deal With Email When You're on Vacation"]. ''Base Line'', By Dennis McCafferty  |  2014-07-03&lt;/ref&gt; and released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itproportal.com/2013/04/16/4-productivity-tools-help-you-get-things-done-iqtell-wunderlist-tracky-basecamp/ "4 Productivity tools to help you get things done: IQTell, Wunderlist, Tracky, Basecamp"].

== Productivity Methods ==

IQTell was designed to fit in with the ''Getting Things Done'' (GTD) productivity methods. Users may have had utilized GTD lists, such as Inbox, Actions, Projects, Someday, Ticklers, and Reference information to process their Inbox items into relevant GTD lists.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/iqtell-is-ready-to-super-charge-your-mobile-productivity/ "IQTELL is ready to super charge your mobile productivity"].

''Tech Republic'', March 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the web app, iOS and/or Android apps, users could deploy macros/shortcuts to quickly process their email.&lt;ref name=muo&gt;[http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/inbox-control-iqtell-might-answer/ "If Your Inbox Is Out of Control, IQTELL Might Be the Answer "].  ''MakeUseOf''. By Dann Albright on 26th March, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Email was turned into tasks (actions), projects, etc.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; The original email was removed from the email inbox.&lt;ref name=muo /&gt;  The email became a part of the items created (e.g. actions, project, etc.) and could also be viewed in the All Mail folder (if [[Gmail]]), or the Archive folder (if non-Gmail). Users had flexibility to use the out-of-the-box macros/shortcuts as well as edit/create additional macros.

IQTELL features included email, calendars, contacts, list management, sharing and collaboration with team members. All of the features were compatible with commonly used organization software such as Evernote&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askyourandroid.com/applications/productivity-applications/iqtell-manage-your-emails-tasks-and-projects-the-smart-way/ "IQTELL: Manage your Emails, Projects and Tasks the smart way'].

'''James Emilius Broome''' (December 15, 1808 – November 23, 1883) was an American politician who was the [[List of Governors of Florida|third Governor]] of Florida.

== Early life and career ==

Broome was born in [[Hamburg, Aiken County, South Carolina|Hamburg, South Carolina]] and moved to Florida in 1837. He engaged in the mercantile business until he retired in 1841. In that same year, Governor [[Richard Keith Call]] appointed him to the position of [[Probate|Probate Judge]] of [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]]. He served in that position until 1848.

== Political life ==

He was elected governor in 1852 as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and took office on October 3, 1853. He was an early [[States' rights|States'-Righter]]. During his term, the [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]], the opposition to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] at the time, controlled the [[Florida State Legislature]]. He vetoed so many of the bills that were passed by the legislature that he became known as the "Veto Governor". After his gubernatorial stint ended on October 5, 1857, Broome served as a member of the [[Florida Senate]] in 1861. A large [[Planter (American South)|planter]], he was very sympathetic to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause.

== Marriages ==

James E. Broome was married five times.  In 1865, he moved to New York City. On a visit with his son in [[DeLand, Florida]], Broome died in 1883.

[[File:Jose_María_Ruiz-Mateos.jpg|thumb|180px]]
'''José María Ruiz–Mateos y Jiménez de Tejada''' (11 April 1931 – 7 September 2015) was a Spanish [[businessman]], [[politician]], serial fraudster and convicted felon.

He began by exporting [[wine]] to [[England]]. He founded the conglomerate [[Rumasa]] and had considerable influence in Spanish society. In 1983, the [[government of Spain]] (the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Party]] was in office at the time and led by [[Felipe González]]) expropriated the company. The government alleged that Rumasa had failed to pay millions of pesetas in mandatory taxes to the national treasury.  The government also claimed that Rumasa was in virtual [[bankruptcy]] and that it was still afloat thanks solely to imaginative accounting by the auditing department of the company.  Ruiz Mateos disagreed with this assessment.  He sued the government for compensation, but has yet to win in court.

He was imprisoned on charges of currency smuggling, fraud and tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EED71F38F930A35751C1A963948260|title=Rumasa Case Jailing Upheld|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 December 1985|page=D00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years in jail, he went back into public life, became the owner of the [[Rayo Vallecano]] football (soccer) team in 1991, and formed [[Ruiz-Mateos Group|his own political party]], as part of which he was elected to the [[European Parliament]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131005002732/http://www-org.elecciones.mir.es/MIR/jsp/resultados/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded a new holding company, New Rumasa, with 16,000 employees. There have been multiple and various court rulings on the Rumasa case both in Spain and outside Spain; the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court have both spoken on numerous judgments. Ruíz Mateos was acquitted in 1999 by the [[Spanish Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://cincodias.elpais.com/cincodias/2003/02/22/empresas/1045924787_850215.html|title=Rumasa aún colea cuatro lustros después|work=[[El País]]|language=es|date=23 February 2003|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a well-known member of [[Opus Dei]], though he was expelled from the group in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com/diario/1986/05/28/portada/517615204_850215.html|title=Ultimátum del Opus a Ruiz-Mateos para que rectifique sus declaraciones|trans-title=Opus issues an ultimatum to rectify Ruiz-Mateos' statements|work=El País|language=es|date=28 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruíz Mateos was the father of 13 sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.elmundo.es/nuevaeconomia/2005/262/1108854001.html|title=Los hijos de Ruiz Mateos se afanan en una nueva colmena|trans-title=Ruiz Mateos' sons are busy with the new hive|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=es|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2011 the ten largest companies within the Nueva Rumasa group were declared in default and unable to make payments to their creditors after the Spanish Social Security, Royal Bank of Scotland and others requested that liens be placed on the companies' assets, nearly twenty-eight years to the day on which his original holding company, Rumasa, was [[expropriation|expropriated]] by the Spanish government.

==Foundation Ruiz Mateos==
The Ruiz-Mateos Foundation was created in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Ruiz-Mateos family, for the express purpose of developing cultural pursuits, especially the visual arts, music and literature. The foundation runs competitions annually, and awards a prize called the "Villa de Rota" in each of these three areas. The Foundation's collection of contemporary art is funded by the competition entrance fees and by the donations of exhibitors who use its exhibition rooms. Among other artists, the museum exhibits works by [[Manuel Benitez Reyes]], [[Wenceslao Robles]] and [[Francisco Luque]]. The Foundation museum, created in 2005, is located in an old family house built in 1865.

{{Merge to|Termination of employment|date=December 2017}}

A '''layoff'''&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/layoff |title=layoff noun - definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionary Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the temporary suspension or permanent [[termination of employment]] of an [[employee]] or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff)&lt;ref name=govuk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/redundant-your-rights/consultation|title=Redundancy: your rights|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing an organization.  Originally, ''layoff'' referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or [[employment]]&lt;ref name="LaborTerm1921"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvard University. Graduate School of Business Administration|title=Labor Terminology|journal=Bulletin of the Bureau of Business Research|date=1921|volume=25|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPQsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English,&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}} requiring the addition of "temporary" to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff is not to be confused with [[Wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]].  ''Laid off workers'' or ''displaced workers'' are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or [[Shift work|shift]] was abolished (Borbely, 2011).&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/lfcharacteristics.htm#displaced|title=Labor force characteristics|date=October 18, 2010|work=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=Glossary|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, W. J., Blinder, A. S. &amp; Wolff, E. N. (2003). Downsizing in America: Reality, Causes and Consequences. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. See also the American Management Association annual surveys since 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sahdev |first1= Kusum|last2=Vinnicombe|first2 = Susan|last3 = Tyson|first3=Shaun|date = 1999|title=Downsizing and the changing role of HR|journal =The International Journal of Human Resource Management|volume = 10|issue =5|pages = 906-923|doi= 10.1080/095851999340224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chorely 2002; Mason 2002; Rogers 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan&lt;ref&gt;Mroczkowski, T. and Hanaoka, M. (1997), ‘Effective downsizing strategies in Japan and America: is there a convergence of employment practices?’, Academy of Management Review, Vol.22, No.1, pp. 226–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmakjian and Robinson 2001&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mellahi, K. and Wilkinson, A. (2004) Downsizing and Innovation Output: A Review of Literature and Research Propositions, BAM Paper 2004, British Academy of Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure.

== Terminology ==
[[Euphemism]]s are often used to "soften the blow" in the process of [[firing]] and being fired.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=A |year=2004 |title= Downsizing, rightsizing and dumbsizing: quality, human resources and sustainability - Total Quality Management |volume= 15 no 8 |url=http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/10072/16844/1/34201_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RedWilk2006&gt;Redman T and Wilkinson A (2006) Downsizing, in T. Redman and A. Wilkinson(eds), Contemporary Human Resource Management,  London: FT/Prentice Hall,  pp.&amp;nbsp;356–381&lt;/ref&gt; The term "layoff" originally meant a temporary interruption in work&lt;ref name="LaborTerm1921"/&gt; (and usually pay). The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that, requiring the addition of "temporary" to refer to the original meaning. Many other euphemisms have been coined for "(permanent) layoff", including "downsizing", "excess reduction", "rightsizing", "leveraging synergies", "[[delayering]]", "smartsizing", "redeployment", "workforce reduction", "workforce optimization", "simplification", "force shaping", "recussion", and "reduction in force" (also called "RIF", especially in the government employment sector).  "Mass layoff" is defined by the [[United States Department of Labor]] as 50 or more workers laid off from the same company around the same time. "Attrition" implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire. "Early retirement" means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later. While "redundancy" is a specific legal term in [[UK labour law]]. When an employer is faced with work of a particular type ceasing or diminishing at a particular location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/redundancy |title=Employers Redundancy procedure, Redundancy Policy, Redundancy compliance |publisher=Citation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be perceived{{By whom|date=March 2011}} as [[obfuscation]]. [[Firing]]s imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer's and employees' control, especially in the face of a recession such as the [[Late 2000s recession|one that began in the late 2000s]].

== Common abbreviations for ''reduction in force'' ==
'''RIF''' - A generic reduction in force, of undetermined method. Often pronounced like the word ''riff'' rather than spelled out. Sometimes used as a verb, as in "the employees were pretty heavily ''riffed''".

'''eRIF''' – Layoff notice by email.

'''IRIF''' - Involuntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did not voluntarily choose to leave the company. This usually implies that the method of reduction involved either layoffs, firings, or both, but would not usually imply resignations or retirements. If the employee is fired rather than laid off, the term "with cause" may be appended to indicate that the separation was due to this employee's performance and/or behavior, rather than being financially motivated.

'''VRIF''' - Voluntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did play a role in choosing to leave the company, most likely through resignation or retirement. In some instances, a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice, perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent, or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package. Conversely, the company is not obliged to accept an employees decision and may not accept every employee who volunteers for a VRIF.

'''WFR''' - Work force reduction.

== Layoffs in the public sector ==
Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recession of 2007-2008]], the [[public sector]] has seen significantly smaller job growth  in employment versus the [[private sector]] and layoffs have been used to ensure sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Čudanov|first1=Mladen|last2=Jaško|first2=Ondrej|last3=Săvoiu|first3=Gheorghe|title=Public and public utility enterprises restructuring: Statistical and quantitative aid for ensuring human resource sustainability|journal=Amfiteatru Economic|date=2012|volume=14|issue=32|pages=307–322|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31686847/Article_1126.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1512052342&amp;Signature=uXsCTUwHwImLMKJJZzloksIrMdY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPublic_and_Public_Utility_Enterprises_Re.pdf|ref=PublicSectorRestructuringSustainability}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the public sector declines the demand for services from the private sector decline as well. Layoffs in the public sector have put limitations on the growth rate of the private sector, inevitably burdening the entire flow of markets.

== Unemployment compensation ==
The risk of being laid off varies depending on the workplace and country a person is working in. Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace typically has two main factors. The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the distribution of unemployment benefits in a workplace outlined in an [[employee handbook]]. The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wonk|first=Kim|date=2010|title=Unemployment Risks and the Origins of Unemployment Compensation|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=45|pages=57|doi=10.1007/s12116-009-9057-9|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Canada, Dorion (1995) states that white-collar workers who have been made redundant receive higher re-employment wages, than those in blue-collar occupations as their job is regarded as being of a higher status than blue collar workers, whereas in France, Margolis (1999, 2002) finds that workers who have been laid off have smaller unemployment periods and higher re-employment earnings in comparison with other unemployed people.&lt;ref name=Okatenko2010&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41219168|title=The Impact of the Reason for Layoff on the Subsequent Unemployment Duration|first=Anna|last=Okatenko|date=1 January 2010|publisher=|journal=Annals of Economics and Statistics|issue=99/100|pages=285–315|via=|doi=10.2307/41219168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of compensation will usually depend on what level the employee holds in the company.

Packages may also vary if the employee is laid off, or voluntarily quits in the face of a layoff (VRIF).  The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee's ability to collect whatever form of [[unemployment compensation]] might be available in their [[jurisdiction]]. In many U.S. states, workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation. Depending on local or state laws, workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits, as are those who are fired for gross misconduct. Also, lay-offs due to a firm's moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits. Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits.&lt;ref name=Lihzis2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://subpay.com/solutions-for-managing-layoffs/sub-pay-plan-legal-precedent-the-origins-and-background |title=SUB-Pay Plan Legal Precedent |publisher=Subpay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331044842/http://subpay.com/solutions-for-managing-layoffs/sub-pay-plan-legal-precedent-the-origins-and-background |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the [[U.S. Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] in the early 1950s, and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the [[IRS]] in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.subpay.com/2011/05/17/what-are-supplemental-unemployment-benefits/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610155850/http://blog.subpay.com/2011/05/17/what-are-supplemental-unemployment-benefits/ |date=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SUB-Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff. By establishing severance payments as SUB-Pay benefits, the payments are not considered wages for [[FICA]], [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|FUTA]], and SUI tax purposes, and employee FICA tax. To qualify for SUB-Pay benefits, the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis.  There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post-downsized ‘anorexic organization’. The benefits, which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing, center on savings in labor costs, speedier decision making, better communication, reduced product development time, enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers (De Meuse et al. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;168). However, some writers draw attention to the ‘obsessive’ pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost cutting, organ failure and an extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient. Hence ‘trimming’ and ‘tightening belts’ are the order of the day.&lt;ref name=TylerWilkinson2007&gt;Tyler M and Wilkinson A (2007) The Tyranny of Corporate Slenderness: Understanding Organizations Anorexically,  Work, Employment and Society,  21: 537-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of layoffs ==
Traditionally, layoffs directly affect the employee. However, the employee terminated is not alone in this. Layoffs affect the workplace environment and the economy as well as the employee. Layoffs have a widespread effect and the three main components of layoff effects are in the workplace, to the employee, and effects to the economy.

'''Effects of layoffs in the workplace:'''  Layoffs have remained the greatest way for a company to cut costs. Although from the employer's perspective a layoff is beneficial for the [[business]], layoffs create an uncertainty in the workplace environment and lowers other employees' [[job security]] as well as creates an apprehension and fear of [[Termination of employment|termination]] for the remaining employees, and subsequently lowers overall motivation in the workplace environment.  According to ''Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations,''&lt;ref name=Noer&gt;{{cite book |url= |last=Noer |first=David |authorlink=David M. Noer |date=2009 |title=Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |doi=10.1002/jts.2490100119 |isbn=9781555425609}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the post-layoff environment, there is a need for empathy, tangibility, self-knowledge, and relentlessly seeking customers among the surviving employees. The remaining employees may have feelings of survivors guilt. In order to diminish negative effects of layoffs, Wayne Cascio suggests alternative approaches to layoff and downsizing as "Responsible restructuring" approach.&lt;ref name="CascioResponsible"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cascio|first1=Wayne|title=Strategies for responsible restructuring|journal=The Academy of Management Executive|date=November 1, 2005|volume=19|issue=4|pages=39–50|doi=10.5465/AME.2005.19417906|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wayne_Cascio/publication/279927986_Strategies_for_responsible_restructuring/links/583cc32a08aeb3987e2f9b55/Strategies-for-responsible-restructuring.pdf|ref=Cascio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism is critical for rebuilding the workplace environment because employees look to their leaders for stability and predictability. No matter the position in an organization, employees will look for job security.

'''Effects of layoffs to the employee:'''  [[Employment|Employees]] (or former employees in this case) can be affected in a couple of different ways. When an employee is laid off, his or her general trust in long-term work may decrease, reducing expectations upon rehire.  After an employee withstands a layoff, the effects can trickle into future employment and attitudes. Layoffs in the workplace often leave the former employee less inclined to trust future employers which can lead to behavioral conflicts among co-workers and [[management]]. Despite new employers not being responsible for a prior circumstances, job performance may still be affected by prior layoffs. Many companies work to make layoffs as minimally burdensome to the employee. At times employers may layoff multiple people at once to soften the impact.

'''Effects of layoffs in the American economy:'''  Layoffs create lower job security overall, and an increased competitiveness for available and opening positions. Layoffs have generally two major effects on the [[Economy of the United States|economy]] and [[stockholders]]. The way layoffs affect the economy varies from the industry that is doing the layoffs and the size of the layoff. If an industry that employs a majority of a [[region]] (freight in the northeast for example) suffers and has to lay employees off, there will be mass unemployment in an economically rich area. This can have leave [[ripple effect]]s nationwide. Unemployment is the biggest effect on the economy that can come from layoffs.

== Layoffs abroad ==
In francophone Belgium, the term [[Procédure Renault]] has become a synonym for the consultation process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s.  When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which is also known as severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave.  If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ending-employment/redundancy/redundancy-pay-and-entitlements|title=Redundancy pay &amp; entitlements|last=Ombudsman|first=Fair Work|website=www.fairwork.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A layoff is also known as a '''retrenchment''' in ([[South African English]]). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called '''[[Redundancy in English law|redundancy]]'''.&lt;ref name=govuk/&gt;  Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between [[Involuntary termination of employment#Termination by mutual agreement|leaving the company of one's own free will]], in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a [[Voluntary redundancy|onetime payment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Involuntary termination of employment#Termination by mutual agreement|leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour]] force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal ''redeployment''.

The framework also matches empirical findings on the shares of average earnings losses following displacement that are due to reduced employment and lower wages."

This article is a '''list of national quality awards'''.

==Background==
A national quality award is typically part of a larger effort by a government to make its country's businesses more competitive in the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2002 | title = The Quest for Global Competitiveness Through National Quality and Business Excellence Awards | publisher = Asian Productivity Organization | publication-place = [[Tokyo]] | page = 93 | isbn = 9789283323327 | oclc = 51512238 | url = http://www.apo-tokyo.org/00e-books/IS-11_GlobalComp.htm | accessdate = 2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The awarding institutions are generally either government departments or ministries{{efn|For example, the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] is part of the [[Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution]] in India.}} or not-for-profit organizations with government ties.{{efn|For example, the Association France Qualité Performance is affiliated with the [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry]] in France.}}  In many countries, however, the awarding institutions are consortia of businesses.{{efn|For example, the [[:pt:Fundação Nacional da Qualidade]] was founded by 39 different private and public organizations.}}  Candidate companies compete in award-specific assessments of business quality and excellence criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = James R | last2 = Lindsay | first2 = William M | year = 1999 | title = The Management and Control of Quality | chapter = 4: Managing for Quality and High Performance | edition = 4 | publisher = South-Western College Publishing | publication-place = [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]] | pages = 143–145 | isbn = 9780538882422 | oclc = 38475486}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assessments are annual and firms who wish to be considered for the awards file applications with the organization that conducts the competition in their home country. Competitors are evaluated by teams of examiners who are volunteers in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and possibly elsewhere. Several examiners separately evaluate company submissions against award criteria after which they meet to discuss their findings and to agree on a  consensus score.  The highest scoring firms advance to the next phase where examiners perform site visits to compare actual practices against those reported in the company submission and finally, awards are given to companies whose practices best fulfill the criteria of the award models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vokurka | first1 = Robert J | last2 = Stading | first2 = Gary L | last3 = Brazeal | first3 = Jason | title = A Comparative Analysis of National and Regional Quality Awards | url = http://asq.org/qic/display-item/?item=13968 | journal = Quality Progress | location = [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] | publisher = [[American Society for Quality]] | publication-date = August 2000 | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | page = 44 | issn = 0033-524X | accessdate = 2014-05-05 | archiveurl = http://www.forms.texas-quality.org/SiteImages/125/Reference%20Library/Comparing%20Quality%20Awards.pdf | archivedate = unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each nation's awards programs only consider businesses within its national borders, there are two notable exceptions:  The EFQM Excellence Award is a transnational award open to businesses operating in one or more European countries and the Deming Prize, which began as the Japan Quality Medal, became the first (and as of 2014 the only) global quality award in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecqi.org/Knowledge-Hub/Resources/Factsheets/Quality-awards/ | title = Quality awards | website = http://www.thecqi.org | publisher = [[Chartered Quality Institute]] | location = [[London]] | accessdate = 2014-05-05 | quote = The Deming Prize, established 1951 (International from 1984) and offered by the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely-recognized quality awards are the [[Deming Prize]] (the first of its kind) and the [[EFQM Excellence Award|EFQM Excellence]] and [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award|Malcolm Baldrige National Quality]] Awards (due to their size).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mouradian | first = George | year = 2002 | title = The Quality Revolution: A History of the Quality Movement | chapter = 8: Awards and Standards | publisher = [[University Press of America]] | publication-place = [[Lanham, Maryland]] | pages = 135–148 | isbn = 9780761821908 | oclc = 49724330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1994 | editor1-last = Barker | editor1-first = Brendan | title = Quality Promotion in Europe | location = [[Aldershot|Aldershot, United Kingdom]] | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing|Gower Publishing]] | pages = 16–17 | isbn = 9780566075124 | oclc = 31090384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The national quality award phenomenon grew out of the [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]] movement of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vokurka | first1 = Robert J | last2 = Stading | first2 = Gary L | last3 = Brazeal | first3 = Jason | title = A Comparative Analysis of National and Regional Quality Awards | url = http://asq.org/qic/display-item/?item=13968 | journal = Quality Progress | location = [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] | publisher = [[American Society for Quality]] | publication-date = August 2000 | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 41 | issn = 0033-524X | accessdate = 2014-05-05 | archiveurl = http://www.forms.texas-quality.org/SiteImages/125/Reference%20Library/Comparing%20Quality%20Awards.pdf | archivedate = unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaf was questioned extensively by the police before being cleared of wrongdoing. There has been speculation of mob involvement in Leplée's death.

==In popular culture==
He is portrayed by [[Gérard Depardieu]] in the 2007 film ''La Môme'' also known as ''[[La Vie en Rose (film)|La Vie en Rose]]''.

'''Sir Martyn Arbib''' is a British businessman who led the [[Perpetual plc|Perpetual]] [[asset management|fund management]] company during the late 20th century, unusually based in [[Henley-on-Thames]], rather than London.

==Early life==
Born into a [[Jewish]] family, Arbib attended [[Felsted School]], Essex.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He sold Perpetual to the fund manager [[AMVESCAP]] in 2001 for more than £1 billion, receiving £113m together with AMVESCAP shares worth £300m, and the company became known as [[Invesco Perpetual]].  He is a director of the Perpetual Japanese Investment Trust plc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=7998316&amp;privcapId=2491470|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Swindon Town Holdings Limited, where Arbib is an investor but not a director, took control of [[Swindon Town FC]].

==Philanthropy==
The Arbib Foundation, established in 1987, sponsors schools in [[Slough]], Berkshire which include the [[Langley Academy, Slough|Langley Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langleyacademy.org/pages/arbibfoundation.html|title=The Arbib Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=The Langley Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbib was a major benefactor in the establishment of the [[River and Rowing Museum]] at Henley, which opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rrm.co.uk/topnav/info_history.htm | title=History | publisher=[[Internet]] | work=[[River and Rowing Museum]] | date=2001 | accessdate=July 19, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523052649/http://www.rrm.co.uk/topnav/info_history.htm | archivedate=May 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was knighted in 2003 for services to charities, especially in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | issue = 56963| date = 14 June 2003| supp = y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In his spare time, Arbib is interested in [[horse racing]]. His horse [[Snurge]] won the [[St. Leger Stakes]] in 1990. As well as Henley, he also has a home in [[Barbados]].

His daughter Annabel is married to businessman Paddy Nicoll.&lt;ref name="standard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/financier-offers-10m-over-the-asking-price-for-record-country-house-sale-7238427.html |title=Financier offers £10m over the asking price for record country house sale &amp;#124; London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=2006-08-27 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father bought [[Culham Court, Berkshire|Culham Court]] for her in 1997 for £12 million, and in 2006, the Swiss-born British financier [[Urs Schwarzenbach]] bought it for £35 million, £10 million above the asking price.&lt;ref name="standard1"/&gt;

'''P and R measures''' are the [[statistics]] used to evaluate the [[efficiency]] and [[effectiveness]] of [[business process]]es, particularly [[automated business process]]es.

The P measures are the ''process'' measures – these statistics that record the number of times things occur. Examples include:
* the [[counting|number]] of times an [[error loop]] is used
* the number of times an approval loop is used
* the [[average]] time to complete a particular task in the process
and show how efficient the process is.

The R measures are the ''results'' measures – these statistics record the 'outcomes' of the process. Examples include:
* the number of occasions when the process completed correctly
* the number of times rejections occurred
* the number of times approval was not given
and show how effective the process is.

'''Pixetell''' was an online communication and collaboration tool for producing and sharing [[screencast]]s, or short videos that present the contents and activity on their computer screen. Its developer, Ontier Inc., was acquired in 2011, but it was not publicly disclosed what company acquired Ontier and its product Pixetell.  The service was discontinued in May 2011.&lt;ref name=silflor&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pixetell screencasts could be combined with audio [[voice-over]], existing video files and [[webcam]] recordings to present  information to the person viewing the recording; [[computer file|attachments]] may be added and sent as part of the message.&lt;ref name=redmond&gt;{{cite web|first=Brien|last=Posey|title=Enrich Your Email|url=http://redmondmag.com/articles/2009/11/01/enrich-your-email.aspx|work=RedmondMag.com|date=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNMoney.com&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software permitted people to [[asynchronous communication|communicate asynchronously]]; as with email, the producer and the viewer did not need to be online at the same time; but as with [[remote desktop software]], it was possible to provide detailed demonstrations of computer-based tasks.&lt;ref name=redmond/&gt;

Pixetell production software was available only for [[Microsoft Windows]]; the recordings were displayed in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] format, and viewable from Windows, [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]].&lt;ref name=redmond /&gt;

The '''Professional Risk Managers' International Association''' ('''PRMIA''') is a [[professional organization]] focused on the "promotion of sound [[risk management]] standards and practices globally", and "the integration of practice and theory";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/about-us PRMIA Charter | Professional Risk Managers' International Association - PRMIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it was founded in 2002 as  a [[non-profit]]. &lt;ref&gt;See also under [[Financial Risk Manager#Dispute]], as well as [https://archive.today/20120909153518/http://www.riskglossary.com/link/garp_scandal.htm GARP Scandal: Global Association of Risk Professionals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides [[professional certification|certification and credentialing]] for professional [[risk manager]]s, as well as other educational programs and resources.

==Professional Risk Manager==
The Professional Risk Manager (PRM) designation is an international [[professional certification]] offered by PRMIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/?page=exam Home | Professional Risk Managers' International Association - PRMIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The designation was first awarded in 2004. The PRM is an "independent validation" of skills within the [[financial risk management]] profession, additionally requiring a commitment to professional ethics. The PRM and the Global Association of Risk Professional's [[Financial Risk Manager|FRM]] are often compared as being the two definitive risk management designations in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;

Candidates are required to pass four exams:
&lt;ol type="I" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance theory, financial instruments and financial markets (2 hours)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematical foundations of risk measurement (2 hours: [[calculus]], [[matrix algebra|matrix-]] and [[linear algebra]], [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[numerical methods]])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk management practices (3 hours: risk management frameworks [capital allocation, [[regulatory capital]], [[economic capital]], [[capital adequacy]]], [[operational risk]], [[credit risk]], [[counterparty credit risk]], [[market risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[funds transfer pricing|FTP]], [[Asset liability management|ALM]])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Case studies]], ''PRMIA standards of best practice, conduct and ethics'', bylaws (1 hour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The exams are computer-based and the questions are all multiple choice; the passing grade is 60%. The exams can be taken in any order and must be completed over a period of up to two years; they are offered during four testing windows per year, each of three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/sites/default/files/references/PRMCandidateGuide.pdf PRM Candidate Guidebook]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual exam pass rates are 54% for Exam II, 59%  for Exams I and III, and 78% for Exam IV;&lt;ref name ="faqs"&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/prm-exam/faq#StructureQ8 FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallstreetmojo.com/prm-exam-profesisonal-risk-manager/ prm-exam], wallstreetmojo.com&lt;/ref&gt; with an overall of just over 65%.&lt;ref name ="faqs"/&gt; The PRM program recognizes other professional designations and gives partial credit to "cross-over" candidates, as well as to graduates of select university programs.

The recommended reading material is the seven volume ''Professional Risk Managers' Handbook'' edited and authored by various practitioners and academics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prmia.org/testsm/authors.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121174854/http://prmia.org/testsm/authors.php|archivedate=2012-01-21|title=PRMIA PRM Handbook - Author Biographies}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Salih Neftci]] and [[Paul Wilmott]]. ''PRM Online Training'' is available for those who wish to access customized [[E-learning|online learning]].

Minimum experience requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/prm-exam/exam-changes#experience1 prmia.org: Changes to the PRM Exam]&lt;/ref&gt; four years without a [[bachelor's degree]]; two years for those with bachelor's degrees; no requirements for holders of a relevant [[graduate school|graduate degree]] (i.e. [[MBA]], [[Master of Finance|MSF]], [[Master of Quantitative Finance|MQF]] etc.) or of an accepted [[:Category:Professional certification in finance|professional designation]] ([[chartered financial analyst|CFA]], [[Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst|CAIA]], [[Certificate in Quantitative Finance|CQF]], etc.). To maintain the designation holder's are required to complete 20 "[[Continuing professional development|Continuing Risk Learning]]" credits each year, to renew their "Sustaining Membership", and to uphold the professional and ethical standards as defined by the ''PRMIA Standards of Best Practice, Conduct and Ethics''.

The computerized tests are offered on all business days. To maintain certification one is required to uphold PRMIA’s professional and ethical standards.

*The Associate PRM covers the core risk management concepts in a less mathematical fashion than the PRM, "allowing non-specialists to interpret risk management information and reports".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/?page=exam&amp;option=trainingAPRM Home | Professional Risk Managers' International Association - PRMIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A single 3 hour exam is required; the recommended text is ''The Essentials of Risk Management'' ({{ISBN|0071429662}}).

*The Operational Risk Manager Certificate  prepares managers to "implement risk assessment initiatives, produce risk management information and understand basic modeling techniques". The exam is 2 hours duration. Preparation is the practitioner-authored ''Operational Risk Manager Certificate Handbook''. ''ORM Online Training'' is also available.

*The Credit and Counterparty Risk Manager Certificate focuses on a practical understanding of credit risk analysis frameworks within financial institutions. The program is designed to be relevant to credit risk staff, as well as to [[Comptroller|financial controllers]], and [[Regulatory_compliance|compliance]] and legal officers. The exam is 2 hours duration. Preparation is the ''Credit and Counterparty Risk Manager Handbook''.

*The Market, Liquidity and Asset Liability Management Risk Manager Certificate covers the areas of [[market risk]], [[liquidity risk]], and [[asset liability management]], and similarly focuses on application in financial institutions. The exam is 2 hours duration. Preparation is the ''Market, Liquidity and Asset Liability Management Risk Manager Handbook''.

==Education and professional development==
PRMIA offers training and development programs in finance and risk management worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/training/professional-development PRMIA Professional Development]&lt;/ref&gt; In the classroom, these are through open enrollment courses, and through company-specific, in-house, customized training. Electronically, the offering comprises over 700 [[short course]]s and 20 professional courses, numerous live and recorded [[webinar]]s, as well other "Risk Resources". The association publishes the various books linked to its examination program, as well as others, and ''Intelligent Risk'', its quarterly newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/risk-resources/prmia-publications PRMIA Publications ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Selling to Zebras: How to Close 90% of the Business You Pursue Faster, More Easily, and More Profitably''''' is a sales book written by Jeff Koser.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Marc (March 5, 2009). “Selling to ‘Zebras’ to Overcome Tough Times.” The Street. http://www.thestreet.com/story/10467695/1/selling-to-zebras-to-overcome-tough-times.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the methodology every sales prospect is quantified by scoring seven traits.&lt;ref&gt;Shold, Clayton (April, 2009). “Selling to Zebras Podcast” Salesopedia. http://www.salesopedia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Margie Zable (July 10, 2010). “Find Your Zebra: Watch Your Sales Skyrocket” Small Business Trends. http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/07/find-your-zebra-watch-your-sales-skyrocket.html&lt;/ref&gt; The book won ''[[USA Book News]]''' "Best Book" in the Business:Sales category.&lt;ref&gt;(2008). “THE USA “BEST BOOKS 2008” AWARDS”(p.22). USA Book News. http://www.usabooknews.com/images/BBresults2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The book is featured in chapter one of "The Sales Gurus: Lessons from the Best Sales Books of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Andrew and the Editors of Soundview Executive Book Summaries (2010). The Sales Guru. Penguin Group. {{ISBN|9781591843382}}. https://www.amazon.com/The-Sales-Gurus-Lessons-Books/dp/1591845939&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of his son, Jeff wrote the book based on his 30 years of sales experience as a sales rep, sales manager and sales executive trying to perfect his selling techniques. The book was published in 2009 by Greenleaf Book Group Press.&lt;ref&gt;Koser, Jeff (2009). Selling to Zebras. Greenleaf Book Group. {{ISBN|978-1929774579}}. https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Zebras-Business-Pursue-Profitably/dp/1929774575&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jeff Koser wrote a book that I consider one of the best sales books I have read in the last decade. What made this book interesting was their methodology and process for identifying a company's best prospects. They developed a very scientific analytical model that can be used by any company." -[[Marc Kramer]], quoted from an article in ''The Entrepreneur''.

==Selling to Zebras, Inc.==
Koser created Selling to Zebras, Inc. as a consulting company in Wisconsin.  After a few years, with the help of long-time friend Brian Gallagher, revenues almost reached $1M a year. Jeff engaged multiple VC firms but none were interested in a small consulting company. So he struck up a deal with a local entrepreneur and software architect, Tom Bowe, to development a cloud-based sales automation software system based on the Selling To Zebras sales methodology&lt;ref&gt;Selling to Zebras, Inc. https://www.sellingtozebras.com&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criminal prosecution==
Following violence and unrest in Ukraine in February 2014, Office of the State Prosecutor in Vienna opened the criminal proceeding against the Klyuyevs and their associates.

Thus, on 11 December 2014 the High Court of Vienna issued decision where it found that the initial suspicion has not been substantiated. The argumentation is exclusively based up on reports of suspected money laundering, the Ukrainian Letter of Request, media reports, and the results of proceedings that were terminated; but there are no concrete indications &lt;ref&gt;[https://economistua.com/yevrosoyuz-znyav-sanktsiyi-z-klyuyeva/Суд ЄС зняв санкції з депутата ВР Сергія Клюєва]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2015 parliament stripped his prosecutorial immunity rights.&lt;ref name=DMK3615&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3109192/Ukraine-starts-criminal-case-against-ally-deposed-Yanukovich.html Ukraine starts criminal case against ally of deposed Yanukovich], [[Daily Mail]] (3 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; At that time Ukrainian state prosecutors were prepared to bring criminal proceedings against him for fraud and embezzlement of budget funds.&lt;ref name=DMK3615/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uatoday.tv/politics/ukrainian-parliament-strips-kliuyev-and-melnychuk-of-immunity-432245.html Ukrainian Parliament strips two MP's of their immunity from prosecution], [[Ukraine Today]] (3 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Klyuyev himself has stated his immunity was lifted due to "political pressure".&lt;ref name=DMK3615/&gt;

During 22 days of consideration of the Motion of the GPO, 3 official meetings of the Committee Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Organization of Work were held with participation of all members of the Committee, working groups with involvement of MPs and most of personnel of the Secretariat of the Committee.

On 21.05.2015 the Committee formally requested answers to 82 questions related to the lifting of MP Klyuyev’s immunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://censor.net.ua/news/336910/reglamentnyyi_komitet_vr_prosit_gpu_predostavit_dopolnitelnye_dokazatelstva_viny_klyueva Регламентный комитет ВР просит ГПУ предоставить дополнительные доказательства вины Клюева]&lt;/ref&gt;
Brief explanations were given on only 11 questions, 71 question remained without any response.

On 28.05.2015 a  Meeting of the Committee of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the Rules of Procedure and Organization of Work were held. Under the pressure of GPO the Committee session was continued on 29.05.2015 behind closed-doors with participation of GPO’s representative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rian.com.ua/politics/20150528/368206108.html Шокин настаивает на закрытом заседании комитета ВР без участия Клюева]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://censor.net.ua/news/337946/reglamentnyyi_komitet_vr_otkazalsya_rassmatrivat_predstavleniya_o_snyatii_neprikosnovennosti_s_klyueva Регламентный комитет ВР отказался рассматривать представления о снятии неприкосновенности с Клюева и Мельничука в закрытом режиме]&lt;/ref&gt;
Wherein, neither mass-media representatives, nor stenography personnel of the secretary of the Committee were permitted entry to this meeting.  Both S.P. Klyuyev and his attorney were denied participation in this meeting  and these actions violated the constitutional rights of defense of S.P. Klyuyev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://112.ua/glavnye-novosti/reglamentnyy-komitet-rady-nachal-zaslushivat-zakrytyy-otchet-gpu-po-klyuevu-232939.html Регламентный комитет Рады начал заслушивать закрытый отчет ГПУ по Клюеву]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the pressure of the GPO, the Committee decided that the motion does not have sufficient grounds, as the evidence provided could not be deemed sufficient; it is impossible to conclude the lawfulness of the collection of the evidence mentioned in the Motion, as the General Prosecutor of Ukraine has not provided the respective materials requested by the Committee, which would confirm otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reglament.rada.gov.ua/vru_reglament/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=42390&amp;cat_id=41622 Решение Регламентного комитета от 29.05.2015]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In compliance with Paragraph 4 of Article 220 of the Rules of Procedure of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Chairman of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine must return the Motion to the GPO in the absence of sufficient evidence to justify the Motion. For the first time in the history of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a precendent was established when a Motion was not returned to the General Prosecutor Office of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unn.com.ua/ru/news/1469507-deputati-viznali-zvinuvachennya-genprokuraturi-s-klyuyeva-neobgruntovanimi Депутаты признали обвинения Генпрокуратуры С.Клюева необоснованными]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2.06.2015, under political pressure, a  Meeting of the Committee of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the Rules of Procedure and Organization of Work were held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lb.ua/news/2015/06/02/306892_pinzenik_otkazalsya_vesti_zasedanie.html Пинзеник отказался вести заседание регламентного комитета по Клюеву и Мельничуку]&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite unprecedented extremely high political pressure on the members of the Committee, according to the Decision of the Committee dated 02.06.2015, the grounds of the motion were not deemed sufficient and the lawfulness of the evidence was not confirmed by the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://112.ua/politika/kuzhel-zayavila-chto-ne-budet-golosovat-za-snyatie-neprikosnovennosti-s-klyueva-i-melnichuka-233894.html (Кужель заявила, что не будет голосовать за снятие неприкосновенности с Клюева и Мельничук]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Not a single new evidence or argument was presented by the GPO and the Decision of the Committee dated 02.06.2015 was driven only by desire to adopt “more comfortable decision for the Chairman of the Parliament Groysman V.B.”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIkbTFIKX3g]&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the decision of the Committee still contains recommendation to return the motion back to the GPO, which is due pursuant to part 4 of the Article 220 of the Rules of Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reglament.rada.gov.ua/vru_reglament/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=42397&amp;cat_id=41622 Решение Регламентного комитета от 02.06.2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130065814/http://reglament.rada.gov.ua/vru_reglament/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=42397&amp;cat_id=41622 |date=2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 03.06.15, despite on the lack of sufficient evidence,.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSXDRCbbsU&amp;feature=youtu.be Video metings of the Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;  parliament stripped his prosecutorial immunity rights.[6]
The immunity lifting activities lack lawful grounding and are completely politically motivated.
Furthermore, the Pecherskyi District Court of Kyiv instructed the GPO to launch a criminal investigation (No. 42015000000001607) dated 24.07.2015 on the illegal influencing of Committee members. The GPO is now obliged to conduct an investigation examining illegal coercion activities performed by:
V.B. Groysman (Chairman of the Parliament),  A.V. Parubiy (First Deputy Chairman of the Parliament), O.V. Lyashko (Coalition Coordinator), Y.V. Tymoshenko (Member of Parliament), E.B. Sobolev (Member of Parliament), and other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ru.files.fm/u/hvdmht4v Ответ ГПУ на решение Суда]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ru.files.fm/u/pxtrgn46 Решение Суда]&lt;/ref&gt;

28 January 2016, the General Court of the EU has annulled the financial sanctions imposed upon Ukrainian Member of Parliament Serhiy Klyuyev by the Council of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/court-deals-new-blow-to-eu-on-ukraine-sanctions/ Court deals new blow to EU on Ukraine sanctions]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2016 the criminal proceeding in Austria was discontinued.  The Reasons of discontinuance of the criminal proceeding against Sergiy Klyuyev and his brother, issued by Public Prosecutor’s Office in the Republic of Austria by dated 4 April 2016  explicitly state that the investigation results now transmitted from the Ukraine were neither conducive to continue the proceeding [in Austria], nor to substantiate a satisfactory suspicion of the offence committed at an earlier date (p.247 Decision EU).
On December 2016, Head of PGO’s Main Investigative Unit Mr. Horbatuk stated to Ukrainian media: “this is the case with Austria, where the arrest of Klyuyev’s money was refused - they cited alleged political persecution by Ukraine. In our opinion, these allegations are groundless.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://ru.tsn.ua/politika/avstriya-otkazalas-arestovat-sredstva-klyueva-iz-za-yakoby-politicheskogo-presledovaniya-gorbatyuk-768798.html Австрия отказалась арестовать средства Клюева из-за якобы политического преследования – Горбатюк]&lt;/ref&gt; 

21 February 2018, the European Court of Justice has ruled on the illegality of the last wave of sanctions imposed by the EU Council in 2017 on Serhiy Klyuyev. In its decision, the court noted that the European Council, introducing sanctions, should have checked grounds for accusations against those named and if there were grounds for "doubting the authenticity of evidence," which Ukraine provide the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/486678.html/EU court lifts sanctions from MP Serhiy Kliuyev]&lt;/ref&gt;

5 March 2018, the Council of the European Union lifts sanctions from MP Serhiy Klyuyev. According to Council Decision (CFSP)2018/333 of 5 March 2018 all 28 th European Union member Countries remove the sanctions from MP Sergiy Klyuyev as well. &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018D0333&amp;from=EN/COUNCIL DECISION (CFSP) 2018/333 of 5 March 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  
16 March 2018, HM Treasury of the UK and the Government og Liechtenstein also excluded Sergiy Klyuyev fron their asset freeze lists.
According to Press Release # 172/18 of 26 March 2018 the Candidate Countries Montenegro and Albania, the EFTA country Norway, member of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, align themselves with this Decision and lift the sanctions from MP Sergiy Klyuyev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/03/26/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-on-the-alignment-of-certain-third-countries-concerning-restrictive-measures-directed-against-certain-persons-entities-and-bodies-in-view-of-the-situation-in-ukraine/Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the alignment of certain third countries concerning restrictive measures directed against certain persons, entities and bodies in view of the situation in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sports agent''' is a legal representative (hence [[agent (law)|agent]]) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and [[Testimonial|endorsement]] contracts for the [[principal (commercial law)|athlete or coach]] whom they represent.
Because of the unique characteristics of the [[sports industry]], sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals.  Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle [[public relations]] matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as [[International Management Group|IMG]], [[Creative Artists Agency]], Roc Nation Sports and [[Octagon (Sports Agency)|Octagon]], agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly.  For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]], which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm Job Profiles.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109035912/http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm |date=2010-01-09 }} – description of roles of sports agent and some educational programs to prepare for the field&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2007/07/16/an-industry-of-conglomerates/ An Industry Of Conglomerates] Sports Agent Blog, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most [[association football|football]] players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article396507.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "The Big Interview: Neil Webb"] ''Sunday Times'', Nov. 28, 2004, interview with soccer/football player&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html "Market Saturation of Agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181903/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html |date=2011-08-10 }}, May 23, 2002, note: source can be translated into English on the website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, there were 33.  According to [[FIFA]], there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[ FIFA – Players' agents list – by country]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. [[NFL]] agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and [[NBA]] agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
The popularity of television shows such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', which stars a [[talent agent]] named [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and ''[[Arliss]]'', have helped glamorize the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2008/12/04/so-you-want-to-be-an-agent-the-entourage-effect/ "So, You Want To Be An Agent? The Entourage Effect"] Sports Agent Blog, Dec. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that, movies such as ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'', and ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent [[Hazel Bailey]]. The television show ''[[Ballers]]'', which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

Due to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son decided to become a football agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/blairs-son-to-become-a-football-agent-1829864.html "Blair's son to become a football agent"] Nov. 28, 2009, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brewers Retail Inc.''', [[trade name|doing business as]] '''The Beer Store''',  is a Canadian privately owned chain of retail outlets selling [[beer]] and other [[malt beverage]]s in the province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Founded in 1927, it was owned at its inception by a consortium of Ontario-based brewers. It currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system primarily owned by 3 large multinational brewing companies. It is also partially owned (under 0.02%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE BEER STORE OPERATIONS REPORT 2017 |url=http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Operational%20Report/OpsReport2017-Final-secured.pdf |website=The Beer Store |accessdate=27 October 2018 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by 30 Ontario-based brewers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us "The Beer Store"&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and to set their own selling prices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/consultations/beer/agreement-exhibitD.html#ar2 "Master Framework Agreement"] Ontario Ministry of Finance&lt;/ref&gt; subject to LCBO price approval that must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Greg (February 10, 2014) [www.thebeerstore.ca/.../default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf "TBS Alcohol Deregulation"], retrieved May 02, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ontario's Liquor Control Act, The Beer Store was formerly the only retailer permitted to sell beer for off-site consumption, other than stores on the site of a brewery, locations of the provincial government-owned [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] (LCBO), and LCBO-authorized agency stores in certain smaller communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90l18_e.htm|title=Liquor Control Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. L.18)|publisher=ServiceOntario ([[Government of Ontario]])|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act and the company's articles of incorporation further stipulate that Brewers Retail cannot sell "hard liquor" (spirits) or consumer goods (like groceries).

Amendments made to the Liquor Control Act have since allowed for the sale of single and 6 packs of beer at select [[supermarket]]s in Ontario. That was done to enhance customer access and convenience. The Beer Store, however, continues to maintain pricing exclusivity in providing consumers discounts on larger packs of beer, along with retail partners, agency stores, combination stores and manufacturer outlets. What distinguishes the Beer Store is its characterization as a sort of "beer commons."&lt;ref name="Flanagan, Greg 2014"&gt;Flanagan, Greg.

==Company==
[[File:The Beer Store.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Beer Store shop.]]

The Beer Store follows an open ownership model whereby any qualifying brewer is allowed the opportunity to become a Beer Store shareholder. Currently, the Beer Store is owned by a consortium of 30 Ontario based brewers. In order to qualify, the brewer must operate at least one facility in Ontario, conduct the full brewing process and sell beer through the corporation. Valid Ontario and Canadian manufacturing licenses are required and the brewer must not produce beer in any other jurisdiction, or else meet minimum annual capacity and production goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Corporate%20Policies/Governance/Master%20Framework%20Agreement.pdf Master Framework Agreement (September 22, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store is governed by the Liquor Control Act (LCA) and is therefore regulated by the LCBO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90l18 Liquor Control Act, RSO 1990, c.L.18]&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, the company operates over 450 retail stores which sell beer to the general public. This makes The Beer Store (TBS) the largest distributor of domestic beer in Ontario, selling to over 20,723 licensed customers. Although many imported beers are available at the Beer Store, the LCBO serves as the primary importer. Once imported, the product is then sold to the Beer Store for further distribution. As the primary retailer of Ontario, The Beer Store sells more than 720 brands of beer and over 1,000 home consumer beer selling units from 180 different brewers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/did-you-know The Beer Store (August 16, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; Larger Beer Store outlets typically stock around 600 beer selling units with the smallest Beer Stores stocking around 200 units.

TBS has a policy of accepting any brewer in the world to sell its product, as long as the brewer meets the requirements set by the LCBO.&lt;ref name="officialhist"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/tbs-history.html
 | title = A proud history in Ontario
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unlike many other retailers, a brewer is given flexibility with regards to how many and which stores it would like to sell its product in.&lt;ref name="officialhist" /&gt; Because The Beer Store operates on a cost-recovery basis, listing fees for smaller breweries can be kept at a minimum. In 2016 TBS implemented a new lower tier rate for qualifying small brewers that is significantly less than the basic service rate paid by the larger brewing companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Corporate%20Policies/Governance/Unanimous%20Shareholders%20Agreement%20of%20TBS%282%29.pdf Shareholders Agreement: Brewers Retail Inc. (January 1st, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller breweries who produce under 1,000,000 hectoliters a year of beer qualify for this lower tier rate on their first 50,000 hectoliters of beer produced that year.  Additionally, qualifying small brewers who produce under 10,000 hectoliters a year are now provided with 2 free guaranteed product listings at 7 of their most proximate Beer Stores.

Currently, workers are represented by the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW) Local 12R24 union.

==History==
The company began in 1927, with the end of prohibition in Ontario. Although prohibition had proven to be unsuccessful, the provincial government still needed to placate angry temperance advocates and agreed that beer would be sold through a single network of stores. However, the government did not want to operate this network itself (as was done in some other Canadian provinces), and so permitted brewers to organize the Brewers Warehousing Company Ltd., which later became Brewers Retail/The Beer Store.

===Operating Model &amp; Pricing Market===
The Beer Store operates on a self-sustaining basis as an efficient distributor and retailer of Beer in the Province of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/ownership-governance/corporate-policy-financial-information TBS Financial Statements]&lt;/ref&gt; Operations take place on a fee for service basis, requiring brewers to pay a fee to sell their products through the Beer Store. The Beer Store publishes an annual rate sheet outlining their necessary financial requirements and consistency with annual budget and business plans.

The open nature of the Beer Store combined with pricing freedom for individual brewers is claimed to have created a highly competitive beer pricing market. The Beer Store processes hundreds of price changes every month and the average retail selling price in the system has only increased 2.8% from 2003 to 2014 while the general rate of Ontario inflation over the same period was approximately 20%.&lt;ref name="Flanagan, Greg 2014"/&gt; Ontario’s uniform pricing regulation precludes price competition between beer retailers such as the LCBO and the Beer Store. Price competition between individual brewers and brands within the Beer Store system is claimed to be significant, but there is little real competition as there is little variance in price both over time and between brands of similar quality. The system does benefit remote areas in that lower priced products are not restricted to larger outlets in urban centers, but are available at all Beer Store locations throughout the province. Hence rural consumers benefit as much (or as little) as urban consumers.

===Estimated profits===
The Beer Store states it operates as a not-for-profit entity.  While this may be true, critics have argued that the TBS system is structured to support relatively high prices and profits of the breweries and the detriment of consumers.  A series of studies, authored or co-authored by professor Anindya Sen of the University of Waterloo, estimated that the near-monopoly the Beer Store has in Ontario allows its owners to capture between $450 to $630 in “additional profits” each year.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya [http://economics.uwaterloo.ca/sites/economics.uwaterloo.ca/files/fac_files/Economic%20Analysis%20of%20Retail%20Liquor%20Sales%20in%20Ontario%20-%20Part%20I%20-%20June%2017.pdf "An Economic Analysis of Increasing Competition in Retail Liquor Sales in Ontario: Part I of a Two-Part Study for the Ontario Convenience Store Association", June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya [http://www.c-storecanada.com/attachments/article/96/An%20Empirical%20Analysis%20of%20Beer%20Price%20Differentials%20Between%20Ontario%20and%20Quebe~.pdf "An Empirical Analysis of Beer Price Differentials Between Ontario and Quebec: Part II of a Two-Part Study Conducted for the Ontario Convenience Store Association", August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya and Masson, Paul R., [https://www.cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed/Commentary_414.pdf, "Uncorking a Strange Brew: The Need for More Competition in Ontario's Alcoholic Beverage Retail System", C.D. Howe Institute Commentary No 414, August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The first of the Sen studies was commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Store Association and surveyed six 24-pack domestic brands from IGA and Metro Quebec flyers compared to the same brands at The Beer Store in Ontario over a 22 week period in 2013.   Sen corrected tax analysis associated with the original study and added three import brands from a Costco in Quebec in subsequent analysis.   Correcting for tax differentials between the two provinces, positive price differences of $1.3 - $3.3 were found to exist between their average price of 24-bottle packs of brands including Molson Canadian, Molson Dry, Coors Light, Budweiser and Bud Light. Using Molson Canadian as an example, the adjusted 24 pack price from Quebec IGA and Metro flyers was found to be $26.81 versus $28.12 for Ontario TBS locations.[16]&lt;ref&gt; Earnscliffe Strategy Group [http://saintjohnswort.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Comparing-Beer-Prices-Final.pdf, "Comparing Beer Prices Between Ontario and Quebec: Comments on the Ontario Convenience Store Association Study", November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Sen’s analysis, The Beer Store commissioned a survey of Quebec – Ontario beer pricing by Debra Aron, an economist with Navigant Economics, which reviewed average TBS home consumer beer prices for all of 2013 in comparison to all beer sales at Quebec seven largest grocery chains, utilizing Neilsen data, for the same period.  Aron’s study concluded that the average TBS beer prices, excluding all taxes, were 18% less than those at Quebec grocery stores in 2013 or on a per case basis approximately $4.40 less per case of 24 cans.&lt;ref&gt; Aron, Debra J., [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/report-prices-at-the-beer-store-lower-than-in-quebec-despite-higher-taxes-515330171.html, "The Price of Beer in Ontario and Quebec", May, 2014, Navigant Economics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green policies===
Since 1927, the Beer Store has refunded deposits on all empty beer containers purchased in Ontario. In February 2007 the [[Ontario Deposit Return Program]] (ODRP) was launched by the Government of Ontario. The ODRP’s goal is to ensure that 100 per cent of all packaging sold at the LCBO follows the same path of all packaging sold at the Beer Store, to be reused or recycled.&lt;ref name="officialeng"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/environmental-leadership
 | title = An Environmental Leader
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All alcoholic beverage containers (over 100ml) purchased in Ontario are accepted for deposit return at any Beer Store location that returns empty containers. ODRP continues to make a meaningful contribution to Ontario’s waste diversion objectives, with the return rate increasing more than 16 percentage points since its first year of operation in 2007. Between the ODRP and Blue Box, an estimated 63,909 additional tonnes of glass is being diverted from Ontario landfills. These materials continue to be directed toward higher-end recycling supporting Ontario’s green economy and generating environmental benefits. “This success means we have recycling factories making new products, instead of higher piles of waste in landfills,” said Jim Bradley, Ontario Minister of the Environment, in an April 2014 statement.&lt;ref name="thebeerstore.ca"&gt;{{cite web| date=August 2014| title=Investing in Ontario’s Common Future: Beer Store Responsible Stewardship 2013 - 2014| url=http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/widget/right/2014%20Stewardship%20Report%20Web_0.pdf| format=PDF| publisher=Brewers Retail, Inc.| accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ODRP, Ontario is now the principal source of quality glass cullet for Ontario glass manufacturing – previously Ontario glass manufacturers had to source glass cullet from other jurisdictions to support production. In 2013-2014, the Beer Store and ODRP program combined, avoided 196,332 tonnes of GHG emissions - equivalent to taking over 41,333 cars and trucks off Ontario roads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energyresources/ calculator.html#results&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, these programs avoided over 2,694,461 gigajoules of energy - equivalent to over $41 million of oil (Note ($94.73/barrel and 6.1 GJ/barrel of oil).

Between 2013-2014, the Beer Store achieved a system-wide recovery and re-use rate of 99 per cent for the industry standard bottles, which are reused 12 to 15 times.&lt;ref name="thebeerstore.ca"/&gt; The Beer Store has received praise from local and national organizations including the [[Conservation Council of Ontario]], [[Environmental Defence Canada]], [[The Recycling Council of Ontario]], and [[Toronto Environmental Alliance]].&lt;ref name="officialenvqt"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = What Others are Saying
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/environmental-leadership/what-others-are-saying
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBS’ recycling efforts translate into cost savings for municipal governments as municipalities need not spend tax revenue on recycling packaging that TBS sells. In 2008, TBS estimated that its return program has saved taxpayers $38 million in avoided waste management and recycling program costs per year.&lt;ref name = "report2008" /&gt; In 2012, the TBS estimated that savings had increased to $40 million with 94% of beer containers and 81% of LCBO containers recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2013/06/28/the_average_beer_bottle_is_refilled_15_times_in_its_environmentallyfriendly_life_cycle.html |title=The average beer bottle is refilled 15 times in its environmentally-friendly life cycle |last=Teotonio |first=Isabel |date= Jun 28, 2013 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store also is actively engaged in reducing its [[carbon footprint]] by finding innovative ways to reduce its energy consumption, a key input for any retail organization, especially one with a need to constantly refrigerate its product.&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/TBSopreport2008.pdf | title = 2008 Operational Report | publisher = The Beer Store | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130170644/http://thebeerstore.ca/TBSopreport2008.pdf | archivedate = 2010-11-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable initiative is the use outside air to cool beer when outside temperatures provide for such a tactic.&lt;ref name="report2008" /&gt;

Pierre Sadik, Senior Policy Adviser at the [[David Suzuki Foundation]] has stated, "Ontarians should be proud of The Beer Store's environmental achievements. It's time businesses across the province follow The Beer Store's lead and turn their talk about waste diversion into real action."&lt;ref name="officialenvqt" /&gt;

===Corporate responsibility===

TBS maintains a strict policy of WeID 25 and the right to refuse any customer who appears intoxicated or who is underage. Furthermore, TBS empowers its retail management to actively monitor and track every employee’s refusal rate to ensure proper conformance to company policy.&lt;ref name="report2008" /&gt; In 2017, TBS employee challenge and refusal rates are the following:

RETAIL BEER CHALLENGES AND REFUSALS CY17 | Jan, 2017 – Dec, 2017

# Minors Challenged/asked to produce I.D:3,388,975 
# Minors Refused service: 31,983
# Intoxicants Challenged/suspected for being impaired (alcohol/drugs): 13,583
# Intoxicants Refused service for impairment: 10,390  
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/social-responsibility
 | title = Social Responsibility
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store works closely with Police agencies across Ontario to report suspected impaired driving. Also Retail employees will work with the customer in finding other means of transportation(cab/transit/call a friend) home if suspected they are impaired and refused service, they go the extra step to make sure the customer will arrive alive and not just let them find a way home.

===Returns for Leukemia===
Since 2006 The Beer Store, UFCW Local 12R24 (the union representing its employees), and the [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada]] have partnered together to help raise awareness and funds for blood cancer research through the collection of empty bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title=2014 Annual Report| url=https://www.lls.org/sites/default/files/National/USA/Pdf/LLS_AR_2014.pdf| format=PDF| p=17| publisher=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society| accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bottle drive is formally called "Returns for Leukemia" but many refer to it as the "Leukemia Bottle Drive". It is held on the last Saturday of May and is also the world's largest bottle drive.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Over the last 13 years, through donations of cash and empties, the event has raised over $15 million for the cause.

==Criticism==
{{original research|section|date=January 2014}}

===Brewer neutrality===
The Beer Store employees are not allowed to recommend one brand over another. Staff can tell customers about the products but cannot encourage customers to choose a specific brand. This policy is known as brewer neutrality.
The Beer Store is permitted to charge non-shareholding breweries listing fees, for each beer carried in stock, that many critics perceive as substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/hughey-r/distribution.php
 | title = 	Beer distribution in Canada
 | first = Robert | last = Hughey | publisher = Real Beer Media, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listing fees have been criticized as restricting competition in the huge Ontario beer market, especially from smaller brewers who often cannot afford the fees, especially for multiple brands.

Some Canadian provinces have since allowed privately owned stores to compete for sales of beer and wine while retaining tighter controls over the sale of spirits, while Alberta has privatized all retail liquor stores. In Ontario no changes have been made, and The Beer Store continues to sell over 80% of the beer sold in the province, and is the only entity legally allowed to sell 12-packs, 24-packs, and other large cases. The Beer Store has only limited competition for retail sales of 6-packs and singles with the government-owned LCBO, select supermarkets, and individual brewer retailers, located on-site at most Ontario breweries. Furthermore, the competition is only with respect to location, as prices between supermarkets, LCBO and TBS are kept uniform. Many critics say this constitutes a foreign-owned monopoly.{{Who|date=May 2018}}

With regards to distribution, TBS operates its own fleet and provides service to over 16,000 licensed establishments in Ontario. TBS also delivers beer to Beer Stores on behalf of brewers who may choose to avoid the high cost of self-distributing. Critics have stated that TBS does not provide any credit terms for licensed clients, forcing them to pay cash on delivery, causing friction between TBS and the hospitality industry.{{Who|date=May 2018}} However, TBS does provide credit terms and flexible payment options for customers. Customers may receive up to seven days of credit terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Consumer prices===
Critics say TBS constitutes a foreign-owned [[monopoly]] over retail beer sales in Ontario, costing the consumer more in the long run in terms of convenience and price. Critics{{who|date=June 2014}} also state that if retail beer sales were opened up, then the average price to the consumer would drop due to competition within the marketplace. TBS has argued that the price of beer will increase if privatization occurs and points to the situations of BC and Alberta as prime examples. In an independent report titled “Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario” by economist Greg Flanagan, it was demonstrated that the general consequence of deregulating the sale of alcohol is an increase in average sale price. Since Alberta’s deregulation of alcohol in 1993, their retail alcohol prices have since tripled Ontario’s (28.2% vs 9.2%).&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Greg. (2014) "Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario."[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; By accounting for tax differentials and comparing the average (non-sale) 24 pack cost of beer between BC, Alberta, Quebec and Ontario, the report concludes stating that Ontarians are well served under the current regulated model.

===Political controversy===
The Beer Store has been subject to criticism following the [[Molson Coors Brewing Company|Molson-Coors]] merger, whose 49% stake in TBS was the last 100% Canadian-owned share of the venture under the pre-merger [[Molson]] Breweries. In 2005, Ontario's alcohol laws were reviewed and proposals to allow the sale of beer in grocery and convenience stores were put forth. A report called the Beverage Alcohol System Review was released on March 24, 2005 by the Ontario Government. However, the report’s findings dealt centrally with the LCBO and the economic and social impact of its privatization.

An online petition was started by a private citizen, Derek Forward, to ask the provincial government to end the monopoly enjoyed by the Beer Store. The petition has received coverage in the Toronto Star, and has generated enough support to allow it to be formally presented to the provincial legislature in the fall of 2008 for consideration (petition No. P–146: "Practice and arrangement of retailing beer"). However, on December 9, 2008, the Ontario government dismissed the petition citing the effectiveness of the TBS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the start of the 2007 provincial election campaign, [[Brick Brewing Company|The Brick Brewing Company]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] made headlines when it claimed The Beer Store engaged in a number of discriminatory practices and policies, such as restrictions on price advertising, for causing a decline in company sales. TBS representatives denied that their policies are hurting small brewers and implicitly questioned the timing of the Brick Brewing Company's statement, suggesting that in their view it is unethical for a brewery to use an electoral campaign to forward self-interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brick claimed  that TBS allegedly used monopolistic tactics to force what is now Ontario's largest independent brewer to stop offering beer in "Stubbies" by withholding supplies of industry standard "long-necked" bottles. The Beer Store claimed that Brick signed an agreement in 1992 to use the industry standard bottle and Brick said it never signed such an agreement. This dispute was settled out of court with the terms of the settlement undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brick has since stopped selling beer in "stubbies" because the cost was too high.

A July 2008 Toronto Star article attributed an industry analyst as estimating the three foreign entities that owned TBS earned $1 billion in profit per year in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/454836 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Dana | last=Flavelle | title=Why your beer costs more | date=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario Craft Brewers]] is the main lobby group for Ontario's smaller brewers, and has been increasingly critical of BRI/TBS. The 29 OCB members currently employ several thousand Ontarians. OCB wants to either acquire shares in TBS or be permitted to set up their own competing chain. Premier McGuinty responded by saying that his government would not consider any application to form a competing chain, and that his government would not consider compelling TBS shareholders to sell any shares, although some Liberal and Conservative backbenchers have said they would expect BRI to at least negotiate in good faith with craft brewers who made a serious offer. BRI responded by saying that it was not considering and would not consider selling shares at any price, and that they do more than enough to accommodate non-shareholding brewers already. Canada's National Brewers (the lobby group that represents the BRI shareholders) further said that in the event OCB did get to set up a competing chain, they would refuse to stock their products there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In February 2012, the website ''Canadian Beer News'' reported that The Beer Store has made thousands of dollars worth of political donations to the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] and [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]]. The report noted that it was odd for an Ontario-based company to be making such large donations to political parties in another province, and suggested that the co-owning breweries were funneling this money through The Beer Store in an attempt to put pressure on the BC government to give their brands favourable placements in [[Liquor Distribution Branch|BC Liquor]] stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Non-competitive business practices===

On December 9, 2014, [[Toronto Star]] investigative journalist Martin Regg Cohn exposed an agreement between The Beer Store and the [[LCBO]] to limit competition and the products offered to Ontario beer drinkers.&lt;ref name="sweetheart"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/09/the_beer_stores_secret_sweetheart_deal_with_lcbo_revealed_cohn.html|title=The Beer Store’s secret sweetheart deal with LCBO revealed|last=Regg Cohn|first=Martin|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lcbo-beer-store-deal-limits-competition-in-beer-sales-report-1.2866076|title=LCBO, Beer Store deal limits competition in beer sales: report|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document of June 1, 2000, provided to him by a [[whistleblower]], entitled “Serving Ontario Beer Consumers — Framework for Improved Co-operation and Planning Between the LCBO and BRI", was signed by then head of the LCBO [[Andy Brandt]] and head of BRI Daver Perkins, of which a copy was sent to [[Ministry of Consumer Services (Ontario)|Ministry of Consumer &amp; Commercial Relations]] Deputy Minister Sandra Lang.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

The agreement ensured that the LCBO would not offer beer products in large format sizes, being cases of 12 or 24 beers, it would not sell major brands to restaurants or bars, and would inform the Beer Store of any store it was planning to open in a new community.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/09/the_beer_stores_secret_sweetheart_deal_with_lcbo_revealed_cohn.html|title=The Beer Store’s secret sweetheart deal with LCBO revealed: Cohn - Toronto Star|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/12/11/how_the_secret_deal_between_the_lcbo_and_beer_store_affects_the_booze_you_buy.html|title=How the secret deal between the LCBO and Beer Store affects the booze you buy - Toronto Star|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regg Cohn says both retail consumers and the food and beverage industry are being gouged by this non-competitive business agreement. Former [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]] CEO Ed Clark, in a 2014 report to the government on maximizing assets, says that the LCBO (and the Government of Ontario) forgoes $515 million of revenue by not allowing sales of larger format beer packages and forgoes $500 million of revenue by not selling major brands to restaurants.&lt;ref name="sweetheart" /&gt;

[[Andy Brandt]], former highly successful head of the LCBO, is very critical of the agreement, and says it was forced upon him by the then [[Mike Harris]] [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt; When Regg Cohn questioned the Beer Store representatives about the agreement, suggesting it is [[collusion]], the reply from the BRI lawyer Michael A. Eizenga of Bennett Jones LLP stated the "use of the term 'collusion' which has significant legal meaning," and "This is an inaccurate and inappropriate characterization, to which my client objects."&lt;ref name="bitter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/10/bitter_fallout_from_the_beer_stores_sweetheart_deal_cohn.html|title=Bitter fallout from The Beer Store’s sweetheart deal|last=Regg Cohn|first=Martin|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Finance Minister [[Charles Sousa]], in response to these revelations, says he has "got the investigation underway" and that "I'm trying to ensure that what you’re suggesting doesn’t happen any further ... You're right, there's a monopoly, a duopoly, oligopoly — call it what you will."&lt;ref name="bitter" /&gt;

On December 10, 2014, [[Restaurants Canada]] filed an official complaint with the [[Competition Bureau]]. "'We did not know the depth of the complicity,' it said, pointing to 'new and disturbing information' in the Star that detailed price gouging of restaurants and bars forced to buy from The Beer Store ... A Competition Bureau spokesperson said it is 'reviewing it to determine whether the conduct in question could raise concerns under the criminal or civil provisions in the Competition Act.'"&lt;ref name="bitter" /&gt;

On April 15, 2015, [[Premier of Ontario]] [[Kathleen Wynne]] announced changes to provincial liquor laws that would, among other changes, allow up to 450 supermarkets in "urban population centres" (roughly equating the number of Beer Store locations) to be authorized to sell beer subject to conditions, require The Beer Store to improve the placement and marketing of Ontario craft brews, and allow LCBO locations to trial carrying 12-packs. Wynne stated that The Beer Store had become a "de-facto monopoly controlled by a small number of companies".&lt;ref name=cbc-grocerybeer&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario to sell off 60% of Hydro One, allow beer in grocery stores|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-to-sell-off-60-of-hydro-one-allow-beer-in-grocery-stores-1.3035347|website=CBC News|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new regulations took effect on December 15, 2015 with 58 designated supermarkets, and additional locations to be added in the future; all products must be below 7.1% alcohol by volume, and at least 20% of a store's stock must be Ontario craft brews. [[Loblaw Companies]] elected to go beyond the minimum quota and committed to stock 50% Ontario craft brews at its participating stores, in an effort to provide a wider array of options.&lt;ref name=torstar-beerfinallyarrives&gt;{{cite web|title=Beer finally arrives in Ontario grocery stores|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/12/15/beer-arrives-in-ontario-grocery-stores.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the sale of beer in supermarkets has increased availability to consumers, it has done nothing to increase competition or lower prices for consumers. Beer prices in supermarkets are dictated by the LCBO, to the point that the LCBO, and not the supermarket, inputs beer prices into store computer check-out systems. Those prices are kept in line with LCBO and TBS prices. Depending on and accounting for the exchange rate at time of purchase, it can cost 25-40% less to buy a 24 pack of Ontario brewed beer at a New York State supermarket than it will cost anywhere in Ontario. It should be noted that current Ontario beer commodity taxes are currently a $11.30 per case compared to New York’s beer excise tax of $0.41 per case.&lt;ref&gt;As of March 2018 under the Alcohol Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act, Ontario collects a basic beer tax of $0.8974 per litre, a volume levy of $0.176 per litre and an environmental levy of $0.0893 per non-refillable containers which equate to $11.30 per 24-cans.  New York’s 2018 state excise tax for beer is $0.14 per gallon which equates to $0.41 per case $Cdn dollars on a 24-pack of cans (assuming a U.S. conversion rate of $1.2861 (12 month average as of March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal beer excise tax and sales taxes are also higher in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://axethebeertax.ca/beertax/pdf/beercanada-report-en.pdf|title=Beer Taxes: A Canadian US Comparison: A Report for Beer Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or?|date=April 2018}}

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
In the film ''[[Strange Brew]]'' the [[McKenzie Brothers]] visit a Brewers Retail store demanding a refund after they attempt to return a bottle of beer that contained a mouse (the mouse was however placed in the bottle by the brothers). Due to the nature of the scene, Brewers Retail refused to allow the use of one of their actual stores for the filming, and also refused to allow the use of the name "Brewers Retail". In response, the filmmakers built their own replica store, and called it "The Beer Store". Coincidentally, several years later, Brewers Retail changed the name of its stores to "The Beer Store", and they continue to operate under this name.

The Beer Store was also showcased in episodes of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' during O'Brien's week-long tenure in Toronto during the week of February 10, 2004.

''''' Timberworld Ltd v Levin''''' was a landmark legal decision concerning whether the peak indebtedness rule operated in [[New Zealand]]. The peak indebtedness rule concerns how much a [[Liquidator (law)|liquidator]] can claw back of the value paid to a creditor of a company, as part continuing business relationship, prior to the debtor companies liquidation. The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] judgment rejected the liquidators contention that the rule should be adopted in [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand law]].

== Background ==
When companies go into [[liquidation]] the liquidator is entitled under s 292 of the [[Companies Act 1993]] to clawback property transferred, money paid, and goods or charges given if it is an insolvent transaction entered into within two years of the company commencing liquidation. An insolvent transaction is a transaction that, as per s 292 (2) of the Act, "(a) is entered into at a time when the company is unable to pay its due debts; and (b) enables another person to receive more towards satisfaction of a debt owed by the company than the person would receive, or would be likely to receive, in the company's liquidation".&lt;ref&gt;Companies Act 1993, s 292(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because the "fundamental principle" underpinning [[insolvency]] law is the ''[[pari passu]]'' or equal step principle.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [49].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as per section 292 (4B) of the Companies Act a "series of transactions will be treated as a single transaction where such transactions are an integral part of a continuous business relationship between the parties (as where the parties have used a running account) and the level of the [[debtor]] company’s indebtedness fluctuates from time to time as a result of the various individual transactions. With a transaction of this type the liquidator will only be entitled to claim the net difference of payments made and goods and services received from a creditor, where there is an ongoing business relationship with the debtor company."&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [30].&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidators in these two appeals heard together sought the court's adoption of the "peak indebtedness rule". The rule this; "would enable the liquidators to choose the point during the two-year specified period when the relevant indebtedness was at its highest, as opposed to an earlier date taking into account transactions predating peak indebtedness."&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [1].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Justice Stevens summarised of the decision's importance, "Naturally liquidators will wish to use the point where the indebtedness of the company is at its highest. On that basis, any later transactions under which the creditor provides further value to the company will be exceeded in value by other transactions reducing the company’s indebtedness. [[Liquidator (law)|Liquidators]] could then point to the net reduction in indebtedness as amounting to a preference. [[Supply chain|Suppliers]], however, will seek to use an earlier date so that any increase in indebtedness is offset by earlier transactions through which the creditor supplier gave value to the debtor company."&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgment ==

The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] ruled against the liquidators,&lt;blockquote&gt;We are satisfied the peak indebtedness rule is not part of the law in New Zealand. If Parliament had intended to adopt it, it could have done so without difficulty. It chose not to do so. Any change to the legislative policy as we have interpreted it would be a matter for Parliament. We therefore dismiss the liquidators’ appeal and cross-appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [99].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Justice Stevens, giving the judgment of the court, explained the "arbitrariness of peak indebtedness in operation" through an example where three different [[creditor]]s supply goods on differing terms to a company, but because of the peak indebtedness rule, the preference they are said to receive is wildly different as some transactions are disregarded by the calculation.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Despite each creditor advancing the same value of goods to Company X and receiving the same payments in return, the peak indebtedness rule can operate to produce vastly different outcomes, merely on the basis of the particular credit arrangements in each case.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Justice Stevens also noted that, &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[New Zealand Parliament|legislature]] did not see fit to address the peak indebtedness rule, or to include it in the wording of s 292(4B). ...The effect of the section, taken on its face, is to require all payments and transactions within the continuing business relationship to be netted off against one another. This includes both payments to the creditor and the supply of goods to the debtor. Of course where the business relationship began before the start of the two year period, only the transactions occurring within the period are taken into account. The statutory wording does not permit a liquidator to disregard some of those transactions. There is also no basis on which the liquidator can commence with only the first payment, and disregard the first supply of goods. The plain meaning of “all transactions” is just that.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [99].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Stevens J observed that similarly to the rule in ''[[Allied Concrete Ltd v Meltzer]]'' [2015] NZSC 7, &lt;blockquote&gt;The distinct treatment of trade creditors is, in our view, a similar mechanism. Parliament took the decision to set aside a particular group of creditors who continue to provide credit and goods on the assumption of future trade. That is seen as having distinct commercial benefits in the context of [[liquidation]]. It is a policy choice consistent with New Zealand’s insolvency scheme generally.&lt;ref&gt;''Timberworld Ltd v Levin'' [2015] NZCA 111 at [98].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Unfair business practices''' encompass [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and oppressive or [[unconscionability|unconscionable]] acts or practices by [[business]], often against [[consumer]]s and are prohibited by law in many countries. For instance, in the [[European Union]], each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], subject to transitional periods. Unfair business practices may arise in many areas, including:
*[[leasing|Tenancy]] matters
*Matters involving the advertising and sale of products and services to consumers
*Matters involving [[insurance]] claims and the settlement thereof
*[[Debt collection]] in cases of [[default (finance)|default]]

In addition to providing for the award of compensatory [[damages]], laws may also provide for the award of punitive damages as well as the payment of the plaintiff's legal fees.

At [[common law]], individuals were not entitled to attorneys fees or punitive damages for wrongful acts committed by businesses in most states.  Most often, laws prohibiting unfair business practices require consumers to send a demand letter to the business prior to commencing with a lawsuit.  If the business fails to make a reasonable offer of settlement within a specified period of time, and is subsequently found liable in court, it may be liable for punitive damages and the injured parties reasonable attorney's fees under many statutes.  In some instances, the statutes provide for prevailing plaintiffs to recover double or triple the actual damages against non-settling defendants.  

When statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices provide for the award of punitive damages and [[attorneys fee]]s to injured parties, they provide a powerful incentive for businesses to resolve the claim through the settlement process rather than risk a more costly judgment in court.

'''Zeppelin University''' (German: ''Zeppelin Universität'', '''ZU''') is a small and highly selective&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/zeppelin-universitaet-ist-bekannt-fuer-ihr-hartes-auswahlverfahren-a-875602.html|title=Zeppelin Universität ist bekannt für ihr hartes Auswahlverfahren|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=17 April 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/mediathek/video/2014/imagefilm-pioneers-wanted-auswahltag.php|title=Mediathek|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; private [[research university]] located at [[Lake Constance]] in [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Germany]]. It is named after the German general and airship constructor [[Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin]], whose foundation is the main financier of Zeppelin University.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the official status, see [http://www.hochschulkompass.de/kompass/xml/download/hs_liste.txt ''Hochschulrektorenkonferenz, Hochschulkompass''] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2003 and is known for its [[avant-garde]] character as well as for a sophisticated selection. On 10. September 2011, ZU was being bestowed the right to award [[doctorate]] and [[habilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-kompass2.de/kompass/xml/akkr/80540_17594_de.htm|title=Akkreditierte Studiengänge - Zentrale Datenbank|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes along with the right to use the title "university" (German: ''Universität'').

== Overview ==
Zeppelin University has the legal form of a non-profit, limited liability organization and calls itself "university bridging business, culture and politics". Thus it stresses the multi-disciplinary character of research and teaching that is an integral part of its self-image. The university is accredited nationally by the Academic Council of the Federal Republic of Germany ([[Wissenschaftsrat]]). The undergraduate major courses are accredited by ACQUIN, a German higher education accreditation agency.

Zeppelin University has two main campuses in [[Friedrichshafen]]: One right on the banks of [[Lake Constance]] (the ''LakeCampus'' or ''SMH'') and the nearby ''ZFCampus'' (or ''FAB3''), which was built from 2013 to 2015 to create more space for the quickly growing university. Both campuses are modern, designed by well-known architects, and contain [[classroom]]s, [[lecture hall]]s, offices, [[cafeteria]]s, a [[library]] and a wing free to use solely by students. From 2007 to 2008 (until the closure of the airport), Zeppelin University had an additional location in the foyer of [[Tempelhof International Airport]] in Berlin, the so-called “Institute for the Art of Swimming on Air”. Since 2011, there is a campus in Berlin again (''CapitalCampus'').

There are several [[student group]]s and projects, such as groups affiliated with political parties (''LHG, Jusos, RCDS''), a debating club (''Soapbox''), the Club of International Politics (''CIP''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international-politics.org/|title=CIP|website=CIP|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Model United Nations group (MUN), which also organizes ''LakeMun'', entrepreneurial groups, a cultural club which also organizes a music festival at the university (''SeeKult''), a student medical service, a filming group, several bands and many more - some of them are even known nationwide (e.g. ''RockYourLife''). In 2008, the student radio station ''Welle20'' went on air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/das-studium/studentische-projekte.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Applicants are selected by the university in an arduous two-step selection process: after a detailed written application, in which the first selection is made, the most auspicious candidates will be invited to an [[assessment centre|assessment day]] (''Pioneers Wanted''). Thereby, the candidates undergo a program consisting of several interviews with professors, students, [[alumni]], and external reviewers, as well as written tests. Furthermore, they have to accomplish a realistic project which is introduced by an associated organisation, whereby a problem has to be solved as a group and must be presented afterwards in front of the assessment committee.&lt;ref&gt;ZU: [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/bewerbung-bachelor/bewerbung.php Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection procedure of ZU is being considered as outstandingly sophisticated, also because of its deviating modalities compared to other universities: ZU deliberately refrain from the solely use of a [[numerus clausus]] (which is widely prevalent in German educational landscape), but instead tries to find personalities which - besides accomplishing the required performance - also fit to the university's character.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; Therefore, the university currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate, which is lower than 10% and a graduate acceptance rate of about 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeppelin-university.de/deutsch/zeppelinuniversity/facts_figures.php?navid=8|title=zu in zahlen|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
Students can graduate with the academic degree of a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A. with 240 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) and a consecutive, as well as a non-consecutive, [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]] (M.A. / M.Sc. with 120 ECTS).

The university offers Bachelor courses in the field of [[Liberal arts education]]. Programs of Study are offered in:
* B.A. [[Sociology]], [[Political Science|Politics]] and [[Economics]] (SPE)
* B.A. [[Business administration|Corporate Management]] &amp; [[Economics]] (CME)
* B.A. [[Communication Science|Communication]] &amp; [[Cultural studies|Cultural Management]] (CCM) and

There are Master programs in:
* M.Sc. Corporate Management &amp; Economics (CME)
* M.A. General Management (GEMA)

Furthermore, the university offers several Executive Master programs (E.M.A.) in:
* E.M.A. Family Entrepreneurship (FESH)

==Rankings==
Zeppelin University is a small and exclusive&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; private university and offers fewer programs than traditional universities in Germany. Due to its young age and small size, it typically goes unranked in international comparisons. Nevertheless, it has reached remarkable results in German Rankings: In the magazine ''Handelsblatt Karriere'', edition 07/08 dated April 27, 2007, Zeppelin University has appeared in a university ranking for the first time. It has instantly reached eighth place with its economic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idw-online.de/pages/en/news?id=206668|title=Zeppelin University unter den Top 10 der deutschen Unis|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most reputable German Ranking, the ''CHE University Ranking'', which was published by ''ZEIT Studienführer'' 2014/15, the university was able to reach the first place with “Corporate Management &amp; Economics” (CME), while [https://www.zu.de/studium-weiterbildung/pair/index.php?navid=538739538739 Politics, Administration &amp; International Relations (PAIR)] was ranked among the three best Political Science programs. In 2011/12 the Communication &amp; Cultural Management program was ranked first place by ''CHE''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zu.de/universitaet/rankings.php|title=Rankings|website=www.zu.de|language=de|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sociology, Politics, and Economics degree is not ranked, due to its multidisciplinarity.
