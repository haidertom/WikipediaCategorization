'''''A Cavalryman''''' is a 19th century painting by French artist [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a French cavalryman on a yellow field. The work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

== Description ==
''Cavalryman'' depicts a French [[dragoon]] of the [[Second French Empire]]. Dragoons were mounted infantry capable of riding into on an engagement on horses before dismounting to engage enemy forces on foot; this important role, coupled with the cost of horses, resulted in dragoons being known as elite-but-expensive troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/cavalry_Napoleon.html|title=Napoleon's Cavalry (Cuirassiers, Dragoons, Lancers, Chasseurs, Hussars)|last=me|website=www.napolun.com|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragoons became a subject of various works of military art, including the works of [[Ernest Meissonier]], whos style De Neuville directly emulated in ''A'' ''Cavalryman''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437220?searchField=All&amp;amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;amp;ao=on&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=Military&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=80&amp;amp;pos=59|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437052|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting itself was produced after the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] resulted an upsurge of interest in the military in the [[French Third Republic]]. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, De Neuville "capitalized on the intense patriotism and dreams of military glory that the French defeat aroused" with his work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Aerograd''''' ({{lang-ru|Аэроград}}, also referred to as '''''Air City''''' or '''''Frontier''''') is a 1935 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[adventure film]] by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] director [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], a coproduction between [[Mosfilm]] and [[Dovzhenko Film Studios|VUFKU]].

==Plot==
A [[Russia]]n outpost in Eastern [[Siberia]] comes under threat of attack by the [[Japan]]ese in this patriotic film from 1935. Aerograd is a new town with a strategically located airfield of vital interest to the government. Work on the new outpost is complicated when tensions develop between workers and a religious sect. The sect threatens to give their support to a band of marauding [[samurai]] warriors who battle for control of the region. Relations between the two countries are further strained in the days before [[World War II]], dating back to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905. In this feature, the Russians are victorious as airplanes throughout the country come to the aid of the beleaguered new town. Director Alexander Dovzhenko, long considered a giant in Russian classic cinema, also wrote the screenplay for this feature.

'''''Albino''''' (also known as '''''The Night of the Askari''''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=67656&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Death in the Sun'''''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioffer.com/i/albino-christopher-lee-178645961&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''Whispering Death''''') is a 1976 [[Germany|German]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] directed by [[Jürgen Goslar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ALBINO:  Directed by Jürgen Goslar, 1976|url=http://www.albinism.org/popcult/film.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and starring [[Christopher Lee]], [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] and [[Sybil Danning]] filmed on location during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. The film is based on the novel ''The Whispering Death'' by [[Daniel Carney]].

==Plot==
Terrick ([[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]]), a [[British South Africa Police]] officer in rural [[Rhodesia]], looks forward towards the end of his police service and early retirement to his farm with his fiancée, Sally ([[Sybil Danning]]). Terrick's hopes for a peaceful life with Sally are shattered, however, when black nationalist guerrillas attack the farm. Sally is raped and murdered by the guerrilla leader, an [[albino]] known only by the moniker ''"Whispering Death"'' ([[Horst Frank]]). Consumed by grief, Terrick and his farmworkers, led by Katchemu ([[Sam Williams (actor)|Sam Williams]]) set out to avenge Sally on their own. They subsequently learn that the guerrillas have summoned the local villagers to a meeting to politicize them and lay an ambush for "Whispering Death" there. However Terrick's party opens fire prematurely, killing and injuring some of the civilians present. The Rhodesian government demands that Terrick's police superior, Bill ([[Christopher Lee]]) hold him accountable for his recklessness and bring him to justice. From its perspective he has endangered the war effort by inflaming the relationship between the security forces and the locals through his irresponsible actions. Bill obligingly orders a manhunt for Terrick, but most of the policemen sympathize with their onetime colleague and are demoralized by the fact they are being ordered to pursue him instead of the guerrillas. They abandon the manhunt and return to their homes. Due to the apparent unwillingness of the police to apprehend Terrick, a crack army unit is called in to assist with the manhunt. 

"Whispering Death" and his guerrillas decide to flee across the border to their sanctuaries in a neighbouring country. However, Terrick and Katchemu, who is an expert tracker, are hot on their trail. The duo become increasingly desperate, with Katchemu torturing a captured guerrilla for information. During a series of bloody skirmishes, Katchemu and nearly all the guerrillas are killed, leaving only Terrick and "Whispering Death" to face each other. Terrick gains the upper hand and stabs his opponent to death. The next morning, pursuing Rhodesian troops finally catch up to Terrick, but he is no longer coherent, having lost his mind as a result of the collective trauma he endured. When he threatens the soldiers with his rifle, they shoot him dead.

==Cast==
* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] as Terrick 
* [[Christopher Lee]] as Member-in-Charge (Bill)
* [[Horst Frank]] as Whispering Death
* [[Sybil Danning]] as Sally 
* [[Sascha Hehn]] as Peter 
* [[Trevor Howard]] as Dr. Johannes
* [[Erik Schumann]] as Captain Turnbull
* [[Sam Williams (actor)|Sam Williams]] as Katchemu

==Reception==
Film scholars Mark Miller and Tom Johnson described ''Albino'' as "a nasty, repugnant tale of racial hatred and revenge", criticizing the "exploitative" treatment which contemporary Rhodesian sociopolitical issues received.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Mark|last2=Johnson|first2=Tom|title=The Christopher Lee Filmography: All Theatrical Releases, 1948–2003|date=1997|pages=281-282|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Incorporated|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0786446919}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also praised Lee and Faulkner's performances.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24011">An '''album cover''' is the front of the packaging of a commercially released audio recording product, or [[album]]. The term can refer to either the printed cardboard covers typically used to package sets of {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} 78-rpm records, single and sets of {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[LP record|LP]]s, sets of 45 rpm records (either in several connected sleeves or a box), or the front-facing panel of a [[compact disc|CD]] [[optical disc packaging|package]], and, increasingly, the primary image accompanying a [[music download|digital download]] of the album, or of its individual [[Track (CD)|tracks]].

In the case of all types of tangible records, it also serves as part of the protective sleeve.

== Early history ==
Around 1910, 78-rpm records replaced the [[phonograph cylinder]] as the medium for recorded sound. The 78-rpm records were issued in both 10- and 12-inch diameter sizes and were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer's name. These were invariably made out of acid paper, limiting conservability. Generally the sleeves had a circular cutout allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.

German record company [[Odeon Records|Odeon]] pioneered the "album" in 1909 when it released the ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'' by [[Tchaikovsky]] on four double-sided discs in a specially designed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | title= Recording Technology History | date= 6 July 2005 | first= Steve |last= Schoenherr | publisher= [[University of San Diego]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065002/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | archivedate= 29 March 2007 | accessdate= 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is not indicated what the specially designed package was.) The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been taken up by other record companies for many years.

Beginning in the 1920s, bound collections of empty sleeves with a plain [[paperboard]] or [[leather]] cover were sold as "[[record albums]]" (similar to a photograph album) that customers could use to store their records. (The name "record album" was printed on some covers.) These empty albums were sold in both 10- and 12-inch sizes.&lt;ref name=personal&gt;Example in personal collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, and suspending the fragile records above the shelf, protecting them.

Starting in the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78-rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled collections. These albums of several 78-rpm records could include a collection of popular songs related by either performer or style, or extended-length [[classical music]], including complete symphonies.&lt;ref name=personal /&gt;

In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] hired [[Alex Steinweiss]] as its first [[art director]]. He is credited with inventing the concept of album covers and [[Cover art#Album cover art|cover art]], replacing the plain covers used before. After his initial efforts at Columbia, other record companies followed his lead. By the late 1940s, record albums for all the major companies featured their own colorful paper covers in both 10- and 12-inch sizes. Some featured reproductions of classic art while others utilized original designs.

When the 10- and 12-inch long-playing records ([[LP record|LP]]s) came along in 1948, and box sets of 45-rpm records soon followed (see [[gramophone record]]), the name "album" was used for the new format of collections, and the creation of artistic original album covers continued.

== Formats ==
From the 1950s through to the 1980s, the 12" LP record and the 45 rpm record became the major formats for the distribution of [[popular music]]. The LP format remains in use  for occasional new releases, though other formats have largely supplanted it. The size of the typical cardboard LP sleeve cover is {{convert|12.375|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

Since the mid-1990s, the [[compact disc]] (CD) has become the most common form of physically-distributed music products. [[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats]] vary, including the jewel case (which since 1982 has been the most popular form of CD packaging), and the cardboard and plastic combination commonly known as a [[Digipak]] (which has been a popular alternative form of packaging in recent years, but remains supplanted by the jewel case due to higher manufacturing costs and lower durability). Typically the album cover component of these packages is approximately {{convert|4.75|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

== Design ==

The Album Art Cover with eyecatching illustration, vibrant colours and lettering, is generally attributed to the American designer Alex Steinweiss in the 1950s.
{{see also|Cover art#Album cover art}}
The cover became an important part of the culture of music.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Doggett|year=2015|title=Electric Shock: From the Gramophone to the iPhone: 125 Years of Pop Music |publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-1-847922182|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; Album art has also been discussed as an important postwar cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, [[the Beatles]]' ''[[With the Beatles]]'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and [[the Rolling Stones]]' [[The Rolling Stones (album)|self-titled debut album]] each contained a cover photograph designed to further the musical artist's public image. Author [[Peter Doggett]] also highlights the cover of [[Otis Redding]]'s ''[[Otis Blue]]'', containing a photo of a young white woman, as a design that "played a dual role: she represented the transcendent power of the music, and obscured the race of its creator."&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; The standard portrait-based LP cover was further challenged over 1965–66 by Dylan's ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', through the inclusion of symbolic artefacts around the singer; the artificially stretched faces of the Beatles shown on their ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album; and the darkened hues applied to the Rolling Stones on ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]''.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt;

[[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s (a folded double cover) and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable work in its own right. Notable examples are [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which had cut-out inserts, printed lyrics, and a gatefold sleeve, even though it was a single album; [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (taken by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]); and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve, and poster and sticker inserts. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'', which included a photograph by Seeff as a poster insert, is an early example of LP artwork quickly becoming a collector's item. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, although attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the reissue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.

The importance of design was such that some cover artists specialised or gained fame through their work. Such people include the design team [[Hipgnosis]], through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others; [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers; [[Cal Schenkel]], for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.

The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News. Retrieved May 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1975, photographer [[Norman Seeff]] was Creative Director at [[United Artists]] and in addition to his many cover photographs ([[The Band]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s [[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter than Hell]], [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]] etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', many of which received [[Grammy]] nominations. In addition to the examples mentioned previously, a number of world-renowned graphic artists and illustrators such as [[Ed Repka]] ([[Megadeth]]), [[Andy Warhol]] ([[The Velvet Underground]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1987) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Andy-Warhol-Velvet-Underground "Andy Warhol &amp; the Velvet Underground"]. In ''Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rolling Stones]]), [[Mati Klarwein]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Miles Davis]]), [[H. R. Giger]] ([[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Debbie Harry]]), [[Frank Frazetta]] ([[Molly Hatchet]]), [[Derek Riggs]] ([[Iron Maiden]]), [[Jamie Reid]] ([[The Sex Pistols]]), [[Howard Finster]] ([[R.E.M.]], [[Talking Heads]]), [[Al Hirschfeld]] ([[Aerosmith]]), [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]] ([[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Manowar]]), [[Gottfried Helnwein]] ([[Marilyn Manson]]), [[Rex Ray]] ([[David Bowie]]), [[Robert Crumb]] ([[Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company]]), [[John Van Hamersveld]] (The Rolling Stones), and [[Shepard Fairey]] ([[Johnny Cash]]) have all applied their talents to memorable music packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948670847|title=Total records : photography and the art of the album cover|others=Beaupré, Antoine de,, Vincendet, Serge,, Stourdzé, Sam,, Denis, Jacques,, Mondino, Jean-Baptiste, 1949-|isbn=9781597113847|edition=First Aperture|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=948670847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952207403|title=Art record covers|last=1978-|first=Spampinato, Francesco,|others=Wiedemann, Julius,|isbn=9783836540292|location=[Koln, Germany]|oclc=952207403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of record covers have also used images licensed (or borrowed from the public domain) from artists of bygone eras. Well-known examples of this include the cover of [[Derek and the Dominos]] ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (from the painting "La Fille au Bouquet" by French painter and sculptor [[Émile Théodore Frandsen de Schomberg]]), 'The Downfall of Icarus' by Genisson on the cover of the first album by [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]; [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] on the cover of [[Deep Purple (album)|Deep Purple]]; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Breugel]] on the cover of [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes]]; the cover of Kansas's debut album, adapted from a mural by painter [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Norman Rockwell]]'s cowboy ([[Pure Prairie League]]), and, more recently, [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva La Vida]]'', which features [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (a favorite in [[The Louvre]]) with the words "VIVA LA VIDA" brushed on top in white paint.

Legends from photography and video/film who have also produced record cover images include [[Drew Struzan]] ([[Black Sabbath]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[The Beach Boys]] and others), [[Annie Leibovitz]] ([[John Lennon]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Patti Smith]]), [[Richard Avedon]] ([[Whitney Houston]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]]), [[David LaChappelle]] ([[No Doubt]], [[Elton John]]), [[Anton Corbijn]] ([[U2]], [[The Killers]], [[Depeche Mode]]), [[Karl Ferris]] ([[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Donovan]], [[The Hollies]]), [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] ([[Patti Smith]], [[Peter Gabriel]]) and [[Francesco Scavullo]] ([[Diana Ross]], [[Edgar Winter]]), [[David Michael Kennedy]] others.

A number of artists and bands feature members who are, in their own right, accomplished illustrators, designers and photographers and whose talents are exhibited in the artwork they produced for their own recordings. Examples include [[Jimmy Page]] (''Led Zeppelin IV''), [[Chris Mars]] (Replacements' ''Pleased to Meet Me'' and others), [[Marilyn Manson]] (''Lest We Forget...''), [[Michael Stipe]] (REM's ''Accelerator''), [[Thom Yorke]] (credited as "Tchocky" on misc. [[Radiohead]] records), [[Michael Brecker]] (''Ringorama''), [[Freddie Mercury]] (''Queen I''), [[Lynsey De Paul]] (''Surprise''), [[John Entwistle]] (''Who By Numbers''), [[Graham Coxon]] (''13'' and most solo albums), [[Mike Shinoda]] (various [[Linkin Park]] albums), [[Joni Mitchell]] (''Miles of Aisles'' and several others) as well for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] (''So Far''), and [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] (credited variously on [[Elastica]]'s ''The Menace'', her records), and [[Captain Beefheart]], 'Mona Bone Jakon', 'Tea for the Tillerman' and 'Teaser and the Firecat' by [[Cat Stevens]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] (all albums released to date), ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' (for The Band), ''Self Portrait'' and ''Planet Waves'' by [[Bob Dylan]], ''Walls and Bridges'' by [[John Lennon]].

Album cover art was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, ''The Cover Story: Album Art'', by Eric Christensen, a [[San Francisco Bay Area]] record collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Whiting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Film-puts-lively-spin-on-album-cover-art-4209802.php#page-1 |title=Film puts lively spin on album cover art |publisher=SFGate |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical design of album covers has been the subject of creative innovation. ''[[Ogden's Nut Gone Flake]]'' by the [[Small Faces]] was originally in a circular metal tin, and ''[[Happy to Meet – Sorry to Part]]'' by [[Horslips]] was in an octagonal package. [[Anyway (album)|Anyway]] by [[Family (band)|Family]] was originally issued in an opaque plastic package through which a design (a Leonardo sketch) could be seen. ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' by the Beatles was first released as a double [[Extended play|EP]] with a booklet between the records. ''Sgt. Pepper'' contained a cardboard sheet of images, and ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (often referred to as the White Album) contained four large glossy photos of the individual Beatles along with a poster-sized collage. ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' by [[The Who]] also contained a generous supply of posters and printed material. ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' had a front cover that contained a revolving disc which brought different images into view through small cut-outs in the outer sleeve. A similar effect was used for the band's later album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' with cut-outs of the windows of a brownstone building. The original issue of ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' by [[the Rolling Stones]] had an actual zipper incorporated into the picture of the crotch area of a pair of jeans. ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' album had a Warhol-designed cardboard banana on the cover that could be peeled back. The record company [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] had a black-and-white design on the centre label that produced a hypnotic optical effect when the disc revolved on the turntable.

== Packaging ==
The album cover is a component of the overall packaging of an album. Especially in the case of vinyl records with paperboard  sleeves, these packages are prone to wear and tear, although wear and tear does often take place to some degree on covers contained within plastic cases. A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear plastic sleeves.

The surface of a vinyl record is readily damaged, so aside from the outer [[paperboard]] sleeve, there is usually an inner protective cover to protect against dust and handling. This is normally shaped to allow it to readily slide within the outer cover. The inner sleeve is either thin white paper, either plain or printed with information on other recordings available from the same company, or a paper sleeve supporting a thin [[plastic bag]]. These quite often have a circular cut out so that the record label can be read without directly handling the record, though when the inner sleeve is printed with lyrics, which became quite common, then there is usually no hole. Decca Records used a system of colour-coding on these sleeves where a blue color denoted a [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] recording while red denoted a [[Monaural|monophonic]] recording (the mono record players of the time were not always compatible with stereo records). This system was begun in the 1960s to reduce packaging costs.

[[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats for compact discs]] widened the variety of presentations as well, even as the size of the CD meant that album covers were no longer so large.

Besides the practicalities of identifying specific records, album covers serve the purpose of advertising the musical contents on the LP, through the use of [[graphic design]], [[photography]], and/or [[illustration]]. An album cover normally has the artist's name, sometimes in [[logo]] form; and the album title. Occasionally, though more common on historical vinyl records, the cover may include a reference number; a branding (the [[Record label|label]]), and possibly a track listing. Other information is seldom included on the cover, and is usually contained on the rear or interior of the packaging, such as a track listing together with a more detailed list of those involved in making the record, band members, guest performers, engineers and producer. On the ''spine'' of the package, the artist, title, and reference number are usually repeated so that albums can be identified while tightly packed on a shelf.

== Album covers in the age of downloads ==
With the increasing popularity of digital music downloading services and the inflating cost of conducting business, the purpose and prevalence of the album cover is evolving. While the [[music industry]] tries to keep up with technological and cultural shifts, the role that packaging (and thus the "album cover") will play in consumer music sales in the near future is uncertain, although its role is certainly changing{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}, and digital forms of packaging will continue to surface, which, to some degree (and to some consumers) take the place of physical packaging.  Both MP3 and WMA music files are able to contain embedded digital album artworks (called cover images or simply covers) in jpeg format. {{as of|2008}}, physical music products, with a physical "album cover", continue to outsell digital downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN3049009520071231?sp=true|title=Digital album packaging should improve in 2008|first = Antony | last= Bruno|publisher=Reuters|date=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, album cover designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], responsible for cover art on albums by [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Roxy Music]], suggested that the album cover was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/45430/designer-peter-saville-the-album-cover-is-dead|title=Peter Saville Says Album Cover is Dead|author=Jason Gregory|publisher=Gigwise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, some artists have used Internet technology to generate even more cover art. For instance, [[Nine Inch Nails]] initially released its album ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'' as a free download on the band's website, attaching separate but thematically connected images to each individual track.

One digital solution is the [[iTunes LP]] format for interactive album artwork introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] on 9 September 2009.

Album art is still considered a vital part of the listening experience to many, and despite the less-tangible nature of digital images, there are still many collectors trading cover art and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |title=About |publisher=Albumartexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013083754/http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |archivedate=2015-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Interactive Marketing and Creative Studio [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/ Beaumonde] released a first of its kind fully [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/blog/trill-sammy-press-release immersive and interactive album cover] for Houston-based rapper Trill Sammy. For the first time ever fans can view the 2D album like they traditionally would, then dive into the album cover via an immersive world available on Trill Sammy's Website. 

== Banned covers ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
{{see also|List of controversial album art}}
Some album covers have been banned due to violence, nudity and other imagery. [[Guns N' Roses]]'s 1987 album ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''{{'}}s cover depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' depicted West naked being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] with her bare breasts and bare buttocks showing.

On 23 October 2008, the [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for the Arts]], [[Peter Garrett]], announced that ANAM would not receive any government funding in 2009&lt;ref name=Age&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/canberra-axes-music-academy-funds-20081023-57gq.html Canberra axes music academy funds], Robin Usher, ''[[The Age]]'', 24 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; despite funding having been arranged initially in 1994 by the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Paul Keating]]. A spokesman for Garret is reported to have said, "ANAM no longer represents the most efficient way of delivering support for elite classical music training." The ANAM Artistic Director Brett Dean said, "That is heart-breaking for music education in this country."

'''Bald arch''' is a technical term used to describe the decay of the crucial [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in stone or masonry buildings. Left unchecked, the progression of the condition will eventually lead to the failure of the arch and any structures supported by it.  

== Causes ==
The structural degradation of arches can occur for a variety of reasons. The stones or masonry components that make up an arch are vulnerable to physical and chemical attack over long periods of time. Sources of damage include atmospheric conditions, human induced mechanical stress, improper design, and natural disturbances like earthquakes or wildlife.

=== Ground Shifting ===
Movement of the ground beneath an arch will eventually destroy an arch by changing the mechanical relationship between stones in the arch. An arch will evenly distribute forces across the surfaces of each stone when it is properly emplaced. Moving the ground below the arch will negatively affect the distribution of stress. An arch will slump in the center if the two sides move apart. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/883973264|title=Conservation of ruins|last=John.|first=Ashurst,|date=2007|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780750664295|oclc=883973264}}&lt;/ref&gt;If the sides are moved closer together, a hinge will form in the arch, increasing the stress on that area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feilden|first=Bernard|date=2007-06-07|title=Conservation of Historic Buildings|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780080502915|doi=10.4324/9780080502915}}&lt;/ref&gt;Arches can also become angled away from level, inducing forces that are not normal to the faces of the individual stones. 

The ground can shift over long periods of time for many reasons. Earthquakes, frost, swelling clays, tree roots, animal burrows, and unstable soils all have the potential to move the foundation of a building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weathering ===
The weather plays an important role in destroying stone structures. Daily or annual freeze/thaw cycles cause water trapped in cracks to expand, breaking up the stones or causing them to shift from their original setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Frost heaving in the ground may move the structure, making it unstable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Precipitation can also be detrimental for certain materials. Limestone and cement are subject to weathering from rain.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/878934936|title=Conservation of buildings|last=John.|first=Harvey,|date=1972|publisher=John Baker|oclc=878934936}}&lt;/ref&gt;Natural rainwater has a pH of 5.6 due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willey|first=Joan D.|last2=Bennett|first2=Ramona I.|last3=Williams|first3=Jeanne M.|last4=Denne|first4=Robert K.|last5=Kornegay|first5=Cynthia R.|last6=Perlotto|first6=Mark S.|last7=Moore|first7=Beth M.|date=January 1988|title=Effect of storm type on rainwater composition in southeastern North Carolina|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00166a003|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=41–46|doi=10.1021/es00166a003|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is low enough to dissolve the calcium carbonate that constitutes limestone and cement. Air pollution can greatly enhance this effect by dropping the pH of the rainwater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;In the eastern United States, the pH of rainwater can be as low as 2.0.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Rain can also dissolve salts from the stone or other sources and redeposit the salt into cracks in the stones or between them. The salts will then crystalize as the water evaporates, putting pressure on the edges of the crack and causing the stones to move or chip.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;This effect is most pronounced in coastal and urban environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Salt damage is also prevalent in cities that employ salts to deice roads and sidewalks. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If an arch includes mortar between the stones the mortar becomes a likely point of weathering. As the mortar decays, the stones on either side will become unsupported and lead to failure.

=== Vibration ===
Human activities can inadvertently damage stone arches. The vibrations caused by road traffic can allow stones to shift over time. An arch will constantly apply pressure to the sides and downwards, so anytime a space is created by vibration on the sides the arch will shift to fill the gaps. As the stones move, the structure will eventually become unstable and collapse.

Many&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|who?]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;attribute the decay to low pitch [[Oscillation|vibrations]] produced by late 19th Century pipe [[Organ (music)|organs]], the proliferation of the 32 foot pipe particularly responsible, although some&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|who?]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;blame the vibrations from inner [[city]] [[traffic]]. The [[Rock (geology)|stone]] becomes crumbly, producing a fine powdered stone. Also, large sections loosen and often fall off, creating another [[hazard]]. 

=== Design Flaws ===
Arches that lack adequate support on the sides will slump and fail. All arches convert some of the weight of the structure into a horizontal outwards thrust. The structure may be stable for a time, but the arch will push the walls around it outwards continuously. This is prevented by proper engineering. Arches can be supported by a buttress on the outer wall, thick, heavy wall construction between the arch and the corner, or by using arches in a series so that each arch is opposed by two others on its sides.

== Prevention ==
The bald arch condition can be prevented by taking precautions during the construction phase and by properly maintaining the stonework over time. Ground movement can be avoided by using a solid foundation. Removing vegetation from near the foundation and preventing animals from burrowing will help to keep the foundation stable.

Frost damage can be reduced by ensuring drainage around the building and by keeping the roof in good condition. This will keep water from saturating the stone and cracking it during cold weather. Keeping water off of the stone will also prevent salt and acid rain damage. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep the rainwater off the walls. Paint can be applied to the stones to protect them from rain and pollution, but this is often rejected because it alters the appearance of historic buildings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;Cleaning the stone regularly can help to reduce the effects of chemical weathering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;Pollutants accumulate on the exterior surfaces of the stone. They react with the stone and degrade the outer portions. This will degrade the appearance pf the stone and eventually weaken it to the point of failure. The most popular methods are scrubbing with fresh water or steam cleaning. This is very expensive and time consuming for a large building. It may be impossible to treat the entire building in one season, and scaffoldings will need to be erected to reach the higher parts. 

== Restoration ==
It is often desirable to preserve an arch because they are common in historic and monumental architecture. Numerous methods are employed for restoring or preserving degraded arches. The first stage in restoring an arch is to evaluate the structure to determine how serious the damage is and what technique is best suited for repair. An architect or engineer will measure the rate of deformation over some period of time, to see how fast the arch is degrading. The deformation could have occurred immediately after construction during the settling period. If that is the case, it is less urgent to repair the damage. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The goal of the restoration is an important consideration. If the goal is only to prevent further deterioration, there will be less work than if the goal is to restore the original condition.

=== Shoring ===
An arch may be shored up by adding new materials to the structure. The mode of failure determines how the arch should be reinforced. The most common failure for arches is an outwards movement of stones near the top. An arch will constantly apply pressure sideways, so the outwards pressure must be managed. If the arch is failing sideways, a buttress can be built to contain the lateral thrust. Steel tensioning rods can take the place of an external buttress to maintain the original appearance in some cases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Removing any stone from an arch without preparing the entire arch will cause it to fail. The arch must be supported before any work can be done. This is done with a falsework of wooden trusses, similar to how the arch is initially built. The entire arch is supported by the wooden falsework. Individual stones can then be removed and repaired or replaced. Repointing or grouting the joints between stones can greatly improve the integrity of the structure. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;If the arch has slumped it can be shored up using a hydraulic jack, and then the stones can be pushed into place and repointed. This can be a very demanding job, since any structures supported by the arch will need to be supported while the arch is repaired. 

The arches can be also be reinforced using steel trusses. Some opponents believe that this degrades the appearance of the arches, that it makes them look like [[Dental brace|dental braces]]. Without this support, the building would be structurally unsound.

== Examples ==
On Wednesday, 14 March 2003, the church of [[Ælfwold II (Bishop of Sherborne)|St Ælfwold]] in the village of [[Ramsbury]] in England was closed temporarily while the masonry was reinforced with steel braces. An example of the damaged stonework is on display in the shop and has been made into a [[box]] for donations.

'''Bjelaj Fortress''' locally known as ''Stari Grad Bjelaj'', is a Medievil town-fortress complex near the Village of [[Bjelaj]], [[Bosanski Petrovac]][[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Location==
Located on the edge of [[the Petrovac plain]] (or part thereof Bjelajsko fields), on the northern slope of the [[Osječenica]] mountain. The area around the city is uninhabited and lean. The whole complex is situated on a plateau about {{convert|850|m}} long.

==History==
On the south end of the northern half, there is a great fort, a prehistoric site from the Bronze and Iron Age. On the north end, there is a small fort. The fort itself has two parts: a medieval southern and northern [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] part. The medieval town has a ground plan of an irregular rectangle over 40 meters long and a width of about 35 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalpark-una.ba/addDocuments/uploads/14666750291810023626.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the tower on the west side is the beginning of the remains of a large pen that was added along with the medieval city in the Ottoman period.

First mentioned in written sources in 1495 and named after the whiteness (or tint) by which it stood out above Bjelajsko field. Ownership is attributed to of King Vladislav II Treasurer, who in 1495 is recorded paying to [[Gašpar Perušić]] the sum of 30 [[forint]]s "to preserve his city of Belaj" (''egregio Caspar Perusyth pro conservatione castri sui Belay dati sunt 30 fl.''). This clearly shows the settlement was defended by this point. Ten years later, in 1505 had most of the city together with the [[Sokolac fortress]] and Ripač by Princess [[Beatrice Frankopan]], limbs Duke Johannes Corvinus, and is in her name all three cities managed kaštelan Dujam Orlovčić.

Between 1530 and 1537, Bjelaj (Bilaj) came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], becoming part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], the villagers and the cadillac Neretva. Already in 1540, it is mentioned for the first time on Bjelaj nahija, and later it is mentioned as Nahija Bjelaj-Blagaj, but soon falls under the cadiluk Kamengrad, which is mentioned as a cadil in the Bosnian or Klis sandbag. From 1562, Nađija Bjelaj was connected to the cadillac Novosel, who was in the cliché sandžak. It was noted that in 1577 a crew of 370 Ottoman mercenaries was placed in the fortress under the dizdar command. From 1592, the city was part of the Bihac captaincy, and from the 18th century to the composition of the Petrovac captaincy. Dizdar Bjelaj (Bilaja) Alijaga was in the demining commission with the Republic of Venice. In 1747 in Bjelaj there was a crew of 30 members and Dizdar Hasanag. According to the list of fortifications and weapons in them from 1833, in Bjelaj (Bilaj) there was 1 top of 12 pedals and 3 small canopies of 6 pedals.&lt;ref&gt;https://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stari_grad_Bjelaj#cite_note-Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
Old town Bjelaj (Bilaj) has two parts: the southern medieval and northern Ottoman part. The medieval city has a layout of irregular rectangles over 40 m long (north-south) and about 35 m wide (east-west). The entrance to the city is in the northward.

===Medieval part=== 
It is half-closed, with partially preserved arches and doorways. In the northwest corner, there is a massive round tower 2/3 off the ramparts, about 16 m high. The entrance to the tower is at a height of about 4 m above the current level of the land. According to the outer form, it is assumed that the inside of the tower was divided into three levels: the ground floor or basement, the level at the entrance level, and the space above the entrance because the ceiling can be seen on the canvas wall continuously. East of the entrance are the remains of a narrow, hollow, heavily-walled area as high as the ramparts (15-16m). That space was built up beside the rampart. Only the upper part of it was preserved and probably served for the rise of soldiers to the top of the wall on which they were coarse, and sometimes small loopholes. On the ground are the remains of the eastern part of the longitudinal wall that forms a whole with the vertical rest of the described wall beside the wall. These remains of a wall on the ground share the easternmost part of the interior of the city from the west. After a few meters they are lost to the south, and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved. Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone. Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded. and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces.

Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded.

They are designed to shoot from a wooden or stone platform in a standing position. On some of them, the vertical and horizontal, nicely carved stone blocks and slabs that were used as frames are still on the inside of the ramparts. Above the loophole is a horizontal array of holes for the ceiling beams above which there are stone consoles. From the ramparts, there is a view of the entire Bjelas field and the surrounding area. The southern slum is completely demolished. Towards the tower next to the western ramparts is the remains of the tank. The fortresses and towers of an older fortress were built of travertine blocks and broken stone. In front of the northern rampart and entrance to the old part of the city, there is a ditch that is saturated, but its contours can be identified.

===Ottoman part=== 
From the tower on the west side are the remains of a large patch which was built alongside the medieval city in the Ottoman era. The precinct is located north of the older part of the city, almost regular in a four-legged shape, 110 m long, about 40 m wide. Only parts of the western ramparts are preserved, up to a height of 2 m. According to the material, they are completely different from the walls of the medieval city. They were built from a finely broken stone blended with plenty of plaster. There was a small mosque in the backyard. Today, at its place, the hollow is filled with a bunch of stones. The entrance to the pavement was on the north wall. He was overwhelmed by a "shaggy bow". In this place, the overhead remains of the ramparts are barely visible or only its traces. The most well-preserved part of the Ottoman times is south and north of the medieval trench, along with the west side of the plateau. At the end of one section of the western ramparts, another entry appeared to be in that wall north of the ditch. Along the eastern side of the fortress is not preserved.

==Current state==
On-site inspection in February 2007, found that the medieval city was still quite well preserved, while only parts of the western wall remained from the Ottoman peninsula. In the walls of the medieval city, the holes from which the stone was taken were seen. It is exposed to deterioration due to neglect, lack of maintenance and absence of an appropriate management plan.

Today Old town Bjelaj is located in the contact zone with the National Park "Una", and in 2007 it was declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7473">The '''black panther''' ({{lang-sl|črni panter}}), also known as the '''Carantanian panther''' ({{lang|sl|karantanski panter}}) after the Medieval principality of [[Carantania]], is a [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthian]] historical [[symbol]], which represents a stylized heraldic [[Panther (legendary creature)#Heraldry|panther]]. As a heraldic symbol, it appeared on the coat of arms of the Carinthian Duke [[Herman II, Duke of Carinthia|Herman II]] as well as of the [[Duchy of Styria|Styrian]] Margrave [[Ottokar III of Styria|Ottokar III]]. In this region it was most frequently imaged on various monuments and tombstones. The symbol can still be found in the coat of arms of the [[Austria]]n state of [[Styria]], although the colours have changed. The symbol is also widely used within structures of the [[Slovenia]]n [[security forces]]; namely by the [[Slovenian Armed Forces]] and the [[Slovenian Police]]. Since 1991, there have been several proposals to replace the [[Coat of arms of Slovenia|Slovenian coat of arms]] with the black panther.

==Origin==
The origins of the symbol are unclear. According to the archaeologist and historian Andrej Pleterski, it appears for the first time in the coat of arms of the [[Sponheim]] family from Carinthia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mladina.si/50763/mitoloske-prikazni/ |title=Mitološke prikazni |language=Slovenian|trans-title=Mythological Apparitions |work=Mladina.si |first=Erik |last=Valenčič |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Peter Štih has denied any historically attested relation to symbols of [[Carantania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mladina.si/93367/slo-intervju--gregor_cerar/ Intervju P. Štiha v Mladini, 15. 12. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the economist [[Jožko Šavli]], an adherent of the autochthonist [[Venetic theory]], believed that it originated from the Roman province of [[Noricum]], was later adopted by Carantania, and then by the [[Duchy of Styria|Styrian]] nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Slovenska znamenja |language=Slovenian|trans-title=Slovene Symbols |year=1994 |first=Jožko |last=Šavli |isbn=961-6097-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later disputed usage==
===Symbol of Carantania===
The symbol of the black panther in its current version was first reconstructed by the historian [[Jožko Šavli]] in the 1980s. Šavli claimed that he had discovered several feudal families originating from the old [[Carantania]]n area that had a black panther in their dynastic coat of arms. He also claimed that he had discovered several documents mentioning the black panther as an ancient symbol of Caranthania. From all these evidences he reconstructed the probable appearance of the symbol of [[Carolingian]] Caranthania.

Šavli's reconstruction soon gained some popularity among younger generations of Slovenian patriots and nationalists. In the last two decades, it has become one of the most recognizable symbols of Slovenian patriotism. It is also used by several nationalistic groups.

===Symbol of Carinthia===
Several academic historians, such as [[Peter Štih]], have disputed the hypothesis that the black panther was the symbol of Carolingian and [[Ottonian]] [[Duchy of Carinthia]]. According to their views, all mentions which would suggest such a conclusion are vague. Furthermore, there is no direct evidence of the symbol dating to the time of the Slavic principality of Carantania. Nevertheless, the ties of the black panther symbol with the territory of the early Ottonian Carinthia seem to be beyond doubt.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Current usage==

[[Jožko Šavli]]'s stylized version of the black panther is widely used within structures of the [[Slovenia]]n [[security forces]]; namely by the [[Slovenian Armed Forces]] and the [[Slovenian Police]]. Within the Slovenian military the symbol is present on a Coat of Arms of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces ({{lang-sl|Generalštab Slovenske vojske}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slovenskavojska.si/struktura/generalstab/ | title = Generalštab Slovenske vojske |trans-title=General Staff of the Slovenian Army | author =  | publisher = [[Slovenian Armed Forces]] official website | date =  | accessdate = 25 March 2016 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Operational Center ({{lang-sl|Združeni operativni center}}), although in the latter case the symbol is reversed and is facing to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slovenskavojska.si/struktura/zdruzeni-operativni-center/ | title = Združeni operativni center |trans-title=United Operational Center | author =  | publisher = [[Slovenian Armed Forces]] official website | date =  | accessdate = 25 March 2016 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The panther is also used in the Coat of Arms of the [[Specialna Enota Policije|special forces unit]] of the Slovenian Police, although in their case stylized in red and presented on a black shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.policija.si/index.php/delovna-podroja/175 | title = Specialna enota |trans-title=Special unit | author =  | publisher = [[Slovenian Police]] official website | date =  | accessdate = 25 March 2016 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit is commonly referred to as the ''Red Panthers'' ({{lang|sl|Rdeči panterji}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/rdeci-panterji-se-dan-za-dnem-urijo-za-pomoc-udarnost-in-ostrino.html | title = Rdeči panterji se dan za dnem urijo za pomoč, udarnost in ostrino  |trans-title=Red Panthers train day-to-day for help, strike and sharpness | author = Mitja Felc | publisher = [[Delo (Slovenia)|Delo]] official website | date = 2 August 2011 | accessdate = 25 March 2016 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.policija.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67167 | title = Rdeči panterji sodelovali v taktični vaji Atlas Common Challenge 2013 |trans-title=Red Panthers participated in a tactical exercise Atlas Common Challenge 2013 | author =  | publisher = [[Slovenian Police]] official website | date = 19 April 2013 | accessdate = 25 March 2016 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/foto-policijski-specialci-najprej-znoj-in-kri-nato-zvestoba-do-groba/309411 | title = Foto: Policijski specialci – najprej znoj in kri, nato zvestoba do groba |trans-title=Foto: Police special forces – first sweat and blood, then loyalty until the end | author = Tina Hacler | publisher = [[RTV Slovenija]] official website | date = 23 May 2013 | accessdate = 25 March 2016 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/specialna.html | title = Foto: Policijski specialci – najboljši med najboljšimi |trans-title=Foto: Police special forces – the best among the best | author = M.

'''Erotica''' is any artistic work that deals substantively with subject matter that is [[eroticism|erotically]] [[sexual stimulation|stimulating]] or [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] but is not [[pornographic]]. [[Erotic art]] may use any artistic form to depict erotic content, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drama]], [[erotic film|film]] or [[music]]. [[Erotic literature]] and [[erotic photography]] have become genres in their own right.

'''Curiosa''' is erotica and pornography as discrete, [[collectable]] items, usually in published or printed form. In the [[antiquarian]] book trade, pornographic works are often listed under "curiosa", "erotica" or "[[facetiae]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary Of Library And Information Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X9CSLFKKC0C|first=V.K.|last=Suraj|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|year=2005|isbn=9788182052536|page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erotica and pornography==
Distinction is often made between erotica and [[pornography]] (as well as the lesser known genre of sexual entertainment, [[ribaldry]]), although some viewers may not distinguish between them. A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes, while erotica "seeks to tell a story that involves sexual themes" that include a more plausible depiction of human sexuality than in pornography.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html "Erotica Is Not Pornography"]. William J. Gehrke. ''The Tech''. December 10, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, works considered degrading or exploitative tend to be classified by those who see them as such, as "porn" rather than as "erotica" and consequently, pornography is often described as exploitative or degrading.&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt;&lt;ref name=India&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/815524.cms "Don't confuse erotica with porn"]. Jug Suraiya. ''[[The Times of India]]''. August 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist writer [[Gloria Steinem]] distinguishes erotica from pornography, writing: "Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain." Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes: "Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|title=Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|year=1984|location=New York|edition=1|isbn=|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Erotica and Pornography: A Clear and Present Difference|magazine=Ms.|date=November 1978|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Pornography—Not Sex but the Obscene Use of Power|magazine=Ms.|date=August 1977|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugène-Baptiste Émile Marie Dauphin''' (30 November 1857, [[Toulon]] - 1930, [[Paris]]) was a French [[marine artist]] and landscape painter.

== Biography ==
His father, Étienne Dauphin, was an entrepreneur who developed properties along the Boulevard de Strasbourg in Toulon. In 1878, he abandoned a preparatory course for the [[École centrale de Lyon]], to pursue a career in art.

He attended the workshops of the "Atelier des Beaux-Arts de Toulon", where he studied with [[Vincent Courdouan]]. After that, he moved to Paris and continued his studies with [[Henri Gervex]]. His début came in 1880, at the "[[Salon des Artistes Français]]", followed by an exhibition at the Salon of the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], of which he later became a member. 

He was named an official [[Peintre de la Marine]] in 1889 and was elected to the "Académie des Peintres de la Marine" in 1894. Shortly after, he paid an extended visit to Algeria. He was created a Knight in the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=COTE&amp;VALUE_1=19800035%2F165%2F21136 Documentation] @ the Base Léonore.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, he was one of numerous painters chosen to decorate the restaurant at the [[Gare de Lyon]] (now known as ''[[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|Le Train Bleu]]''), creating a panel in the main hall, depicting Toulon.&lt;ref&gt;
Louise Gaggini, et al., ''Le Train Bleu'', éd. Presse Lois Unis Service, Paris, 1990 {{ISBN|2-908557-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also decorated the buffet at the [[Gare de Nice-Ville]]. 

In 1922, a major decorating project was begun in the foyer at the [[Opéra de Toulon]]. Sixteen large canvases were commissioned from sixteen painters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toulon.fr/envie-bouger/proxy/opera Opéra de Toulon] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Dauphin provided one, called ''Le Vaisseau Fantôme'' (The Ghost Ship), based on ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]].

'''''Fallen Astronaut''''' is an {{convert|8.5|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[aluminium]] [[sculpture]] created by '''Paul Van Hoeydonck'''. It is a small stylized figure, meant to depict an [[astronaut]] in a [[spacesuit]], intended to commemorate the astronauts and [[cosmonaut]]s who have died in the advancement of space exploration. It was commissioned and placed on the [[Moon]] by the crew of [[Apollo 15]] at [[Mons Hadley|Hadley Rille]] on August 1, 1971, next to a plaque listing the fourteen men known at the time to have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Sculpture, Fallen Astronaut| url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A19860035000| website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum| accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew kept the memorial's existence a secret until after completion of their mission. After public disclosure, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] requested and received a replica of the statue. Controversy soon followed, as Van Hoeydonck claimed a different understanding of the agreement made with the astronauts and attempted to sell up to 950 copies of the statue. He finally relented under pressure from [[NASA]], which has a strict policy against commercial exploitation of the US government space program.

==Commission==
[[Image:Willy Bosschem255.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Portrait of Van Hoeydonck'' by [[:nl:Willy Bosschem|Willy Bosschem]]]]
Prior to his [[Apollo 15]] lunar mission, astronaut [[David Scott]] met [[Belgian]] painter and printmaker Paul Van Hoeydonck at a dinner party. It was there agreed that Van Hoeydonck would create a small statuette for Scott to place on the Moon, though their recollections of the details disagree.  Scott's purpose was to commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts who had lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration, and he designed and separately made a plaque listing fourteen American and Soviet names. Van Hoeydonck was given a set of design specifications: the sculpture was to be lightweight but sturdy, capable of withstanding the temperature extremes of the Moon; it could not be identifiably male or female, nor of any identifiable ethnic group. According to Scott, it was agreed Van Hoeydonck's name would not be made public, to avoid the commercial exploitation of the US government's space program.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|Shapiro|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott kept the agreement secret from NASA management prior to the mission, smuggling the statue aboard his spacecraft.

Van Hoeydonck gives a different account of the agreement: according to an interview in Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'', the statue was supposed to be a representation of all mankind, not only fallen astronauts or cosmonauts.  He claimed he did not know the statue would be used as a memorial for the fallen space-goers, and the name given to the work was neither chosen nor approved by him; he had intended the figure to be left standing upright.  He also denies it was agreed he would remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Soir|17 July 2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both his and Scott's versions of events are given in an article in [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'' magazine]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;

==Placement on the Moon==
During the [[Apollo 15]] mission, near the completion of his work on the lunar surface on August 1, 1971, Scott secretly placed the ''Fallen Astronaut'' on the Moon, along with a plaque bearing the names of eight American astronauts and six Soviet cosmonauts who had died in service:

Scott photographed the memorial, but waited for a post-mission press conference to publicly disclose its existence. Later, he noted that "Sadly, two names are missing (from the plaque), those of [[Valentin Bondarenko]] and [[Grigori Nelyubov]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leonov|Scott|2013|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that the western world was unaware of their deaths, because of the secrecy surrounding the Soviet space program at the time. Also missing was the name of [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.]], the first black astronaut and a U.S. Air Force officer selected for the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program who was killed in a training accident in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7018497/#.Vp9XNk_YxIU |title=The Unsung Astronaut |last=Oberg |first=James |work=[[NBC News]] |date=2005-02-23 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Brief Jan Stalmans - Paul Van Hoeydonck 11-09-2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Query from Jan Stalmans to  Van Hoeydonck about the number of outstanding replicas, with handwritten reply]]

After the crew disclosed the statuette's existence during their press conference, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] requested that a replica be made for public display. The crew agreed, on condition that it be displayed "with good taste and without publicity".  The replica was given to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] on April 17, 1972, the day after CBS anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]] referred to the ''Fallen Astronaut'' and plaque as the first art installation on the Moon during the broadcast of the Apollo 16 launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19860035000| title=Sculpture, Fallen Astronaut| work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now on display with a replica of the plaque&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19772403001|title=Plaque, Fallen Astronaut and Cosmonaut, Reproduction|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Museum's [[National Mall]] Building in the Space Race Wing, Gallery 114.

In May 1972, Scott learned that Van Hoeydonck planned to make and sell more replicas. Believing that this would be a violation of the spirit of their agreement, and NASA's policy against commercial exploitation of the space program, Scott tried to persuade Van Hoeydonck to refrain. It was advertised in a full-page advertisement in the July 1972 issue of ''Art in America'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After complaints from NASA about the intended sale, Van Hoeydonck retracted his permission for it and no statues were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Bussche|1980|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2007, art journalist Jan Stalmans wrote to Van Hoeydonck, asking him how many replicas were in existence. Van Hoeydonk returned a handwritten response on the letter, that 50 copies had been made, most of which were still in his possession, unsigned. Van Hoeydonck wrote that he had only ever received money for one copy of ''Fallen Astronaut'', despite many purchase offers he had received (see the English translation [[:File:Brief Jan Stalmans - Paul Van Hoeydonck 11-09-2007.jpg|of the letter]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8063">'''Famous People Players''' is a [[black light puppet]]ry theatre company. It is based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and tours worldwide. It is a [[non-profit organization]] which employs people with physical and intellectual disabilities. Those individuals share duties in dining room management, arts administration, and theatrical and visual arts performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous PEOPLE Players Dine &amp; Dream Theatre|url=http://www.seetorontonow.com/listings/famous-people-players-dine-dream-theatre/|website=See Toronto|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inception, the company has paid homage to the works of famous people within its own theatrical context, hence the name '''''Famous People'' Players'''.

==History==
The Famous People Players was founded on June 1, 1974, by Diane Dupuy of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. At inception, the company consisted of Dupuy and an assistant, eleven performers, and Dupuy's mother Mary Thornton; Thornton designed and built the costumes and props.

The company's original piece was ''Aruba Liberace'', in which a life-size character of [[Liberace]] plays the piano. It is still the company's signature performance. Liberace attended a showing of ''Aruba Liberace'', and was so impressed he invited Famous People Players to perform with him in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The company debuted in Las Vegas in October 1975; over the subsequent ten years, the company performed with Liberace both in Las Vegas and internationally.

As a result of the increasing popularity of Famous People Players, the company was featured as regulars on [[CBC Television]]'s 1976-1977 variety series, ''[[The Wolfman Jack Show]]''; the network also later produced and aired ''Carnival of the Animals''. In 1980, ''Sorcerer Apprentice'' premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York. In 1982, Famous People Players was invited to perform in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The company's first Broadway Show, ''A Little Like Magic'', opened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City and ran for 49 performances in 1985.&lt;ref name="PlaybillVault"&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/7116/A-Little-Like-Magic Playbill Vault: A Little Like Magic], accessed April 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to New York in 1994 for a 4 week run, under the sponsorship of Phil Collins and actor Paul Newman, where they performed the show ''A Little More Magic'' for inner city kids to dream BIG!&lt;ref name="PlaybillVault"/&gt;

==Dine and Dream Theatre==
In 1994, the company opened the '''Dine and Dream Theatre'''; [[Paul Newman]] funded the restaurant's development from some of the proceeds of [[Newman's Own]] products and [[Phil Collins]] funded the theatre's [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]]. In 2009, facing the demolition of its 25-year location, the company moved further west to a new location. Despite damage caused by storms and unexpected costs from the city of Toronto, the company survived and opened its first show in its new location on October 23, 2009.

The '''Dine and Dream Theatre''' is located at the company's Toronto west-end headquarters. Guests first arrive to the restaurant for dinner, where they are served by individuals who also perform in Famous People Players productions. After dinner, they are led to the '''Phil Collins Theatre''', where the main production is performed. The theatre is named after [[Phil Collins]], who became a source of inspiration for the actors when he viewed a performance interpretation of his music. It is currently the only theatre in Canada exclusively devoted to puppetry performance.

==Recognition==
The troupe has been subject of numerous talk shows, specials and documentaries. A 1984 [[CBS]] movie-of-the-week entitled ''Special People'' was based on the company's early history. ''A Little Like Magic'', which detailed the company's operation and success, was an [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary. The company was also featured in the plot of an episode of the popular U.S. television drama ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' in 2002.

In co-production with Treehouse's "Roll Play" Famous PEOPLE Players program for the juice box set {{Clarify|date=February 2009}} is hugely popular.  The theatre troupe first broke into this market with their Toronto Dinner Theatre as a guest spot location for Treehouse kingpin "This is Daniel Cook."

Founder Diane Dupuy has been inducted as a member of the [[Order of Canada]] in recognition for her contributions to Canadian society through the company and mother Mary C. Thornton has won many accolades, most recently with The Toastmasters as woman of the year.

==Productions==
Famous People Players has created many productions over its 30-year history. (''Note: The table below is currently incomplete.'')

''Leave the Porch Light On'' was the company's first original, full-length musical production and was created for the company's 25th-anniversary. The initial performance of ''Leave the Porchlight On'' was attended by a number of celebrities and other well-known people, including the [[Governor General of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=66 Governor General of Canada: Opening Performance of "Leave the Porch light On" -- the 25th Anniversary Production of the Famous People Players]&lt;/ref&gt; The production was very successful and is still occasionally performed at the company's theatre in Toronto and on tour. A sequel of sorts followed two years later, entitled ''Hide and Seek: A Game of Human Spirit''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4399">'''Film rights''' are rights under [[copyright]] law to produce a [[film]] as a [[derivative work]] of a given item of [[intellectual property]]. In [[US law]], these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or "[[option (filmmaking)|option]]") them to someone in the film industry—usually a [[film producer|producer]] or [[film director|director]], or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties—who will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as "exhibition rights" or "public-performance rights".

==Origins==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from [[case law]].  In 1907, the [[Kalem Company]] produced a one-reel [[silent film]] version of General [[Lew Wallace]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'' without first securing film rights.  Wallace's estate and his American publisher, [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] sued for [[copyright infringement]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the [[precedent]] that all adaptations are subject to copyright.

== Options ==
When producers '''option''' a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property.  A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it "greenlit".    Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights.

The contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.

== Chain of title ==
As it is common for scripts to be stuck in [[development hell]], the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights.  This lineage is referred to as the [[chain of title]].  This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided.  Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights.

In some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights.  It is important for an [[entertainment lawyer]] to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.

The '''flag of Quebec''', called the '''''Fleurdelisé''''' ('''''the Lily-flowered''''') represents the province of [[Quebec]]. It was adopted by the [[government of Quebec]] during the administration of [[Maurice Duplessis]]. It was the first provincial [[flag]] officially adopted in [[Canada]], first shown on January 21, 1948, at the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building of the National Assembly]] in [[Quebec City]]. Quebec's [[Flag Day]] (January 21) commemorates its adoption each year, though for some time it was celebrated in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/D_12_1/D12_1.HTM|title=''Flag and emblems of Québec, An Act respecting the'', R.S.Q. c. D-12.1|website=www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one parade marked the flag's 60th anniversary in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Motor parade through the streets of Quebec City. CTV Newsnet broadcast, Jan. 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==
Article 2 of ''An Act respecting the flag and emblems of Québec'' confers the status of [[national emblem]] ({{lang-fr|emblème national}}) to the flag of Québec.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/drapeau-et-symboles-nationaux/ Drapeau et symboles nationaux] on the [http://www.gouv.qc.ca/ Government of Quebec's website], retrieved on May 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-d-12.1/latest/ An Act respecting the Flag and emblems of Québec, R.S.Q. c. D-12.1]", in ''CanLII''. Federation of Law Societies of Canada, retrieved August 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
The ''Fleurdelisé'' takes its white cross from the ancient royal flags of France.

Its white [[fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]] (symbols of purity) and blue field (symbolizing Heaven) come from a banner honouring [[the Virgin Mary]]. One such was reputedly carried by [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] militia at General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]]'s [[battle of Carillon|victory at Carillon]].

The flag is [[blazon]]ed ''Azure, a cross between four fleurs-de-lis argent''. Its horizontal symmetry allows both sides of the flag to show the same image.

== Protocol ==
[[File:Flag of Quebec (1-2).svg|thumb|1:2 variant]]
The flag's official ratio is 2:3 (width to length), but the flag is very often seen as a 1:2 variant to match the [[flag of Canada]] in size when flying together.

The Act concerning the flag and emblems of Quebec states that "in all cases, the flag of Quebec has precedence over any other flag or emblem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/d-12.1/20061117/whole.html|title=''Flag and emblems of Québec, An Act respecting the'', R.S.Q. c. D-12.1|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under federal protocol, the Canadian flag takes precedence when both are flown.&lt;ref&gt;Federal protocol gives precedence to the Canadian flag over provincial ones, and to the flags of the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], 10 [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governors]] and some 24 members of the British-based [[House of Windsor|royal family]] over the Canadian flag, when they are present at a specific location.[http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/2_e.cfm PCH.GC.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official shade of blue is [[Pantone]] 293. In [[8-bit]] [[RGB color model|RGB]], it is # 003399.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdeie.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/contenu/documents_soutien/piv/normes_quebec.pdf|title=Normes d’utilisations / Signature du gouvernement du Québec|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficial variants using a lighter blue are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ca-qc.html#color|title=Quebec  (Canada)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{ref improve|section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Flag of the Patriote movement (Lower Canada).svg|thumb|left|150px|The green, white and red tricolour used by the [[Parti canadien|Parti patriote]] between 1832 and 1838]]The desire of French Canadians in Quebec for a distinctive flag was longstanding. Other flags that had been used included the ''[[Parti canadien|Parti Patriote]]'' flag, a horizontal green, white, and red [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]], which became the flag of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]]; as well as the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]].

The direct predecessor of the modern Fleurdelisé was created by [[Elphège Filiatrault]], a parish priest in [[Saint-Jude, Quebec]]. Called the ''Carillon'', it resembled the modern flag except that the fleurs-de-lis were at the corners pointing inward. It was based on an earlier flag with no cross and with the figure of [[the Virgin Mary]] in the centre.

The ''Carillon'' flag was first raised on September 26, 1902, and is preserved in the [[Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec]] archives. Another version, with the [[Sacred Heart]] in the centre, also appeared, but was left behind in the push for a new provincial flag after [[World War II]]. The ''Carillon'' flags were used informally.

On May 26, 1868, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] approved [[Coat of arms of Quebec|Quebec's first coat of arms]]. A flag might have been devised by using the arms to deface a [[blue ensign]] (a [[Union Flag]] in the [[flag terminology|canton]], and the Quebec coat of arms in the [[flag terminology|fly]]). However, it appears to have never been used&amp;nbsp;— various sources including the official Quebec government site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/drapeau/histoire/fleurdelise.html|title=Drapeau et symboles nationaux|website=www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; mention that it was the [[Union Flag]] that flew over the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] until January 21, 1948, not the blue ensign. In addition, in 1938, at the opening of a mining school in [[Val-d'Or]], the flag used to represent the Quebec government was a banner of arms. This was done at the behest of public servant Burroughs Pelletier,&lt;ref&gt;Father of [[Jean Pelletier]]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been told that the Ministry wanted a symbol but were unsure as to what should be used.

In 1947, an independent member of the Legislative Assembly, [[René Chaloult]], demanded a new provincial flag to displace the unpopular (amongst some segment of the population of Quebec) [[Canadian Red Ensign]] and to replace the neglected Quebec blue ensign. Various ideas were discussed between Chaloult, [[Lionel Groulx]], and [[Maurice Duplessis]]. One such idea involved incorporating a red maple leaf (later to be adopted for the [[flag of Canada]]). Burroughs Pelletier was also asked to present a few proposals to Duplessis, none of which were adopted. He was however consulted about what became the present design.

On January 21, 1948, the new flag was adopted and was flown over the Parliament Building that very afternoon. Apparently, it was the ''Carillon'' flag that flew that day, because the modern Fleurdelisé (with the fleurs-de-lis repositioned upright to their modern configuration in correspondence with the rules of [[heraldry]]) was not available until February 2.&lt;ref&gt;Bouvier, Luc.  "[http://pages.infinit.net/cerame/heraldicamerica/etudes/drapeaux.htm Histoire des drapeaux québécois: du tricolore canadien au fleurdelisé québécois]", in [http://pages.infinit.net/cerame/heraldicamerica/ ''HeraldicAmerica''], retrieved May 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag was adopted by [[Royal Proclamation]], and the news was presented to the Legislative Assembly more or less as a ''fait accompli''. Opposition leader [[Adélard Godbout]] expressed his approval, as did René Chaloult. A law governing the usage of the flag was later officially adopted by the Quebec Parliament on March 9, 1950. A more recent version of such a law was adopted in 2002.

A 2001 survey by the [[North American Vexillological Association]] ranked the Fleurdelisé as the best provincial or territorial flag, and the third-best of the flags of all U.S. and Canadian provinces, territories, and states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nava.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NAVANews_2001_vol34no2.pdf|title=North American Vexillological Association News – Issue #170|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag of Quebec was the basis for the jerseys of the [[Quebec Nordiques]], which included the same colour blue, the fleurs-de-lis, and white stripes.

'''Georg Nees''' (23 June 1926 – 3 January 2016) was a German academic who was a pioneer of [[computer art]] and [[Generative art|generative graphics]]. He studied mathematics, physics and philosophy in [[Erlangen]] and [[Stuttgart]] and was scientific advisor at the [[Semiosis|SEMIOSIS]], International Journal of semiotics and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Semiosis, http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/kuenstler/nees/biografie/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he was appointed Honorary Professor of [[Computer science|Applied computer science]] at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]]&lt;ref&gt;Arbeitsberichte des Instituts für Informatik Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg, 2003  [https://www.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/wp-content/uploads/Jahresberichte/JB_2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Nees is one of the "3N" computer pioneers, an abbreviation that has become acknowledged for [[Frieder Nake]], Georg Nees and [[A. Michael Noll]], whose computer graphics were created with digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Klütsch (2007, Juli): Computergrafik: Ästhetische Experimente zwischen zwei Kulturen. Springer, 2007, Page 20, {{ISBN|9783211394090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst'', Staatsgalerie Stuttgart In: Katalog, 1972, Page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and studies ==
George Nees was born in 1926 in [[Nuremberg]], where he spent his childhood. He showed scientific curiosity and interest in art from a young age and among his favorite pastimes were viewing art postcards and looking through a microscope. He attended a school in [[Schwabach]] near Nuremberg, graduating in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwv-net.de/index.php?art=Grenzzeichen&amp;mod=Onlineshop&amp;view=Artikel&amp;abid=129 Autorenvita] auf der Webseite des Deutschen Wissenschafts-Verlags.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1945 to 1951, he studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Erlangen]] then worked as an [[Applied mathematics|industry mathematician]] for the [[Siemens-Schuckert|Siemens Schuckertwerk]] in Erlangen from 1951 to 1985. There he started to write his first programs in 1959.&lt;ref name="on1.zkm.de"&gt;http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$5255&lt;/ref&gt; The company was later incorporated into the [[Siemens AG]].

From 1964 onwards, he studied philosophy at the [[University of Stuttgart|Technische Hochschule Stuttgart]] (since 1967 the [[University of Stuttgart]]), under [[Max Bense]]. He received his doctorate with his thesis on [[Generative art|Generative Computergraphik]] under Max Bense in 1969. His work is considered one of the first theses on [[Generative art|Generative Computer Graphics]]. In 1969, his thesis was published as a book entitled "Generative Computergraphik" and also included examples of program code and graphics produced thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Generative Computergraphik, Siemens AG, Berlin, München, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement in 1985 Nees worked as an author and in the field of [[computer art]].

== Computer Art ==
In February 1965, Nees showed - as works of art - the world's first [[Generative art|computer graphics]] created with a [[digital computer]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart'' In: ''Katalog'', 1972, Page 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition, titled ''computer graphik'' took place at the public premises of the "Study Gallery of Stuttgart College".&lt;ref&gt;computer grafik, edition rot 19, Max Bense und Elisabeth Walther, Stuttgart, 1965,  {{ISBN|3874510190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he started to work on "computer-sculptures".&lt;ref name="Franke"&gt;Herbert W. Franke: ''Grenzgebiete der bildenden Kunst, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart'' In: ''Katalog'', 1972, Page. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalog of the [[Kunsthalle Nürnberg|Biennale 1969 Nuremberg]], Nees describes how the computer program controlled the milling machine so that instead of a workpiece, a sculpture was created. Three painted wooden sculptures and several graphics were shown at the Biennale 1969 Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Computerkunst'', in: Katalog, Konstruktive Kunst: Elemente + Prinzipien, Biennale Nürnberg, 1969, No page numbers in the catalog&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 at the 35th [[Venice Biennale]] his work was part of the special exhibition "Research and Design. Proposals for an experimental exposure" and showcased his sculptures and graphics of art and architectural design.

[[File:Automatisches Zeichengeraet ZUSE Z64 ubt.JPG|thumb|Flatbed drawing machine ZUSE Z64, Photograph by Tomasz Sienicki (one work)]]
In 1963, Nees was instrumental in the purchase of a [[flatbed plotter]], the Zuse Graphomat Z64 designed by [[Konrad Zuse]], for the data center at the Schuckertwerke in Erlangen.&lt;ref&gt;http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader$5232&lt;/ref&gt; At the exhibition ''Georg Nees – The Great Temptation'' at the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]] Nees said: ″There it was, the great temptation for me, for once not to represent something technical with this machine but rather something ‘useless’ – [[Geometric patterns|geometrical patterns]].″&lt;ref name="on1.zkm.de"/&gt;

Using the [[ALGOL]] language, Nees created drawings and graphics for production, art and architectural drawings. He wrote the new graphics libraries G1, G2 and G3 with ALGOL, for controlling the Z64 and [[random number generator|random number generation]].&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W. (1971), "Computers and visual art", Leonardo 4 (4): Page 331–338, {{doi|10.2307/1572504}}, {{JSTOR|1572504}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 Nees experimented with random numbers and [[Arc (geometry)|circle arcs]] (''Kreisbögen''). The graphic ''Kreisbogengewirre'' (Arc confusion)&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: "Generative Computergraphik", Siemens AG, Berlin, München, 1969, Page 236-239.&lt;/ref&gt; was a graphic of this series, also known as ''Locken''. [[Frieder Nake]] explains how this graphic was created: ″In fact, the picture does consist of one continuous path of arcs. … The length and radius of the individual arcs are randomly chosen within the limits defined by the programmer  … The picture in it present form is due to a fairly serious programming error … It was designed to be less complex and it had to be ended manually because of the error.″&lt;ref&gt;Frieder Nake: Computer Art: Where‘s the Art?; Bilder Images Digital. Computerkünstler in Deutschland 1986. München, Barke, 1986, de, en, Page 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Nees worked with the ''Siemens System 2002''&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Siemens 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; to create aesthetic graphics, such as the graphic ″gravel ″ (''Schotter'') in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Computerkunst'', in: Katalog, Konstruktive Kunst: Elemente + Prinzipien, Biennale Nürnberg, 1969.No page numbers in the catalog&lt;/ref&gt; This artwork is well known and can be seen on the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref&gt;https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O221321/schotter-print-nees-georg/.&lt;/ref&gt; When writing the program Nees introduced commands for random numbers, which produced from a designated point on the resulting chaos. This causes the graphic to develop from order to disorder or vice versa, if the graphic is turned through 180 degrees (upside down).

Robert J. Krawczyk wrote in his text ''A Shattered Perfection'': Crafting a Virtual Sculpture: ″Georg Nees’s Gravel Stones … What attracted me to this piece was the simplicity of the concept and the overall interpretation of transforming order into disorder. … What intrigues me with this "ancient" piece was the use of exact mathematical computations to model a chaotic image and the progression from the ordered to the disordered.″&lt;ref&gt;http://mypages.iit.edu/~krawczyk/rjkiv02.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer designed architecture ===
The first computer graphic produced in architecture by Nees was the motive ''corridor'' (''Flur'') in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf Herzogenrath (Hsgr.), Barbara Nierhoff-Wielk: Ex Machina - Frühe Computergrafik bis 1979: Die Sammlungen Franke und weitere Stiftungen in der Kunsthalle Bremen. Herbert W. Franke zum 80.Geburtstag. Deutscher Kunstverlag, Bremen, 2007, Page 440-443, {{ISBN|9783422066892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 started his collaboration with the architect Ludwig Rase for the Siemens Pavilion at the [[Hannover Messe|Hannover Industrial Fair]] in 1970. The drawings of the [[truss| truss roof]] was first calculated with the System 2002 and drawn with the Graphomat Z64. For the Hannover fair in 1970 the drawings were created with the modern System 4004 again. One of the drawings was printed as a poster for the Hannover Fair and for the 35th [[Venice Biennale]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf Herzogenrath (Hsgr.), Barbara Nierhoff-Wielk: Ex Machina - Frühe Computergrafik bis 1979: Die Sammlungen Franke und weitere Stiftungen in der Kunsthalle Bremen. Herbert W. Franke zum 80.Geburtstag. Deutscher Kunstverlag, Bremen, 2007, Page 443, {{ISBN|9783422066892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also computer drawings for fair pavilions of the Siemens AG, such as the "German Industry Exhibition" in [[São Paulo]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf Herzogenrath (Hsgr.), Barbara Nierhoff-Wielk: Ex Machina - Frühe Computergrafik bis 1979: Die Sammlungen Franke und weitere Stiftungen in der Kunsthalle Bremen. 2007, Page 440-443, {{ISBN|9783422066892}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[fair pavilion, São Paulo, http://www.tu-cottbus.de/projekte/de/great-engineers/ingenieure/mengeringhausen-max-1903-1988/erfindungen.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db-bauzeitung.de/allgemein/max-mengeringhausen/ fair pavilion, São Paulo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Rase experimented based on the [[cuboctahedron]] for residential dwellings and urban design&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Rase: ''Computerdesign für Raum und Fläche''. In: NOVUM Gebrauchsgraphik Heft 8, 1972, S. 48-56&lt;/ref&gt; with Nees creating the computer aided design plans for the project. The graphic "Cuboctahedron" developed during this was used for the cover and poster of the exhibition ''Computer art. nees rase'' in the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jul/5/prosthetic-knowledge-picks-algorists/ Ludwig Rase, Georg Nees: Kuboktaeder, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From 1985 on ===
Nees retired in 1985 and started his research and experiments again. He devoted his time solely to semiotics and aesthetics for media and design. He published the results from 1995 onwards in several books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;''Formel, Farbe, Form: Computerästhetik für Medien und Design'', Springer, Berlin, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Grenzzeichen. Bilder und Gedanken zu einer constraint-orientierten Ästhetik'', Deutscher Wissenschaftsverlag, Baden-Baden, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Alex Kempkens]] asked Nees whether he wished to participate in the exhibition ''Bilder Images Digital'' in the ″Gallery of the Artist″&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Galerie der Künstler|Gallery of the Artist]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Munich]], which was planned for October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Giloth, Copper; Pocock-Williams, Lynn (1990), "A Selected Chronology of Computer Art: Exhibitions, Publications, and Technology", Art Journal 49 (3): Page 292, {{doi|10.2307/777121}}, {{JSTOR|777121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helga Biesel: [http://www.computerwoche.de/a/ausstellung-digital-belebte-kunstwelt,1166909 ''Berufsverband Bildender Künstler entdeckt Computer als Handwerkszeug. Ausstellung: Digital belebte Kunstwelt.''] In: [[Computerwoche]] vom 14. November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; He said yes and created a new series of computer graphics. These graphics have a special position within the oeuvre by Nees. To generate the graphics he gave the [[Artificial intelligence|AI engine]] simple, [[Philosophy|philosophical]] as well as [[Mythology|mythical]] commands. Based on the commands, the computer produced different graphics. He wrote the programs in the Lisp language and a System 7000 calculated the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: Künstliche Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz, In: Bilder Images Digital, Barke Verlag, 1986, de, en, Page 112, {{ISBN|3-926167-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nees wrote in the exhibition catalog: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;My own computer graphics in the spring of 1986, I understand as studies on ambience, as they could be synthesized by perhaps a future Reagiblen machines. An essential part task in the design of such machines is thinking out sample dialogues, which one would like to perform with the finished instrument. The following dialog could then be feasible: ″Show me a [[sphere]].″ The automaton would respond with the production of the image ″sphere north-west-nadir.″ The dialog would continue with ″Add on the context, [[Mythology|myth]]; visualize the contrast between [[law]] and [[coincidence]].″; The response would be the image, ″Apollo and Dionysius″.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Künstliche Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz'', In: ''Bilder Images Digital'', Barke Verlag, 1986, de, en, Page 112, {{ISBN|3-926167-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The art critic Eva Karcher wrote in the interpretation of his graphics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The automaton as &gt;creativity stimulant&lt;?  A mental concept which one can only consider cautiously and which however can call in question all the hitherto binding definitions of the inviolability of the human creative capacity.Looking at the multi-patterned constructions in Nees' graphics, with their floating ellipsoids, crystalloid spheres and bizarre forms, one cannot help but acknowledge and appreciate their atmospheric and inspiration-inducing effects.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: ''Künstliche Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz'', In: ''Bilder Images Digital'', Barke Verlag, 1986, de, en, Page 114, {{ISBN|3-926167-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nees died on 3 January 2016 at the age of 89.&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/agent/15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Modern generative graphic design ===

{{main|Generative Design}}
Georg Nees was not only a pioneer of computer art, but also one of the grandfathers of computer supported design processes – the [[Generative Design]].
In 1963, the Zuse Graphomat Z64 was used to draw technical plans, which are required for the manufacture of parts and products. As he said, he thought also of his ideas - to make experimental and generative design. The reason for him to write the book "Formel - Farbe - Form", 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783642633850&lt;/ref&gt; was to convey his knowledge about "Computer aesthetics of Media and Design" - based on generative design - to the next generation of designers. The current generation of designers uses as professional title for example "generative design" and operates under the concept of generative Design, data driven art or computational design. Nees also makes it one of the progenitors of today's generative design for art, advertising and animation – based on his Ph.D. thesis ''Generative Computergraphik'' and the book ''Generative Computergraphik'' in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Nees: "Generative Computergraphik", Siemens AG, Berlin, München, 1969.

'''Gesso''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒɛsso}}; "[[chalk]]", from the {{lang-la|[[gypsum]]}}, from {{lang-el|γύψος}}) is a white [[paint]] mixture consisting of a [[Binder (material)|binder]] mixed with [[chalk]], [[gypsum]], [[pigment]], or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1DFuGQeG10C&amp;pg=PA32 |title=The materials and techniques of medieval painting |author= Daniel Varney Thompson| page= 32 |via=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[work of art|artwork]] as a preparation for any number of substrates such as wood panels, [[canvas]] and sculpture as a base for paint and other materials that are applied over it.

==Traditional gesso==
"''Gesso''", also known "glue gesso" or "Italian gesso"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o23u0SuRLxsC&amp;pg=PA321 ''The Painter's Handbook: A Complete Reference'' by Mark David Gottsegen. p. 321] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603155459/https://books.google.com/books?id=o23u0SuRLxsC&amp;pg=PA321 |date=June 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a traditional mix of an animal glue binder (usually [[rabbit-skin glue]]), chalk, and white pigment, used to coat rigid surfaces such as wooden [[panel painting|painting panels]] as an absorbent [[Primer (paint)|primer]] coat substrate for [[painting]]. The colour of gesso was usually white or off-white. Its absorbency makes it work with all painting media, including water-based media, different types of [[tempera]], and [[oil paint]]. It is also used as a base on three-dimensional surfaces for the application of paint or [[gold leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHa9dxrh5g0C&amp;pg=PA148 |title=Lettering &amp; Calligraphy Workbook |publisher= Diagram Group| page= 148 |via=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing and applying it is an art form in itself since it is usually applied in 10 or more extremely thin layers. It is a permanent and brilliant white substrate used on wood, [[masonite]] and other surfaces. The standard hide glue mixture is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking, thus making it suitable for rigid surfaces only. For priming flexible [[canvas]], an [[emulsion]] of gesso and [[linseed oil]], also called "half-chalk ground", is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160624135136/https://books.google.com/books?id=o23u0SuRLxsC&amp;pg=PA64 ''The Painter's Handbook: A Complete Reference'' by Mark David Gottsegen, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt; In geology, the Italian "gesso" corresponds to the English "gypsum", a calcium sulfate mineral (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

=== Use in sculpture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Gesso is used by [[sculpture|sculptors]] to prepare the shape of the final sculpture (fused bronze) or directly as a material for sculpting.
Gesso can also be used as a layer between sculpted wood and gold leaf. In this case, a layer of refined and coloured clay, called ‘bole’ is used to cover the gesso before applying the gold. This is usually red in colour.

==Acrylic "gesso"==
Modern "[[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] gesso" is a widely used ground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCN21wUqnS8C&amp;pg=PA28 |title=Elizabeth Tolley, Oil Painter's Solution Book – Landscapes: Over 100 Answers to Your Oil Painting| page =28 |via=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a combination of [[calcium carbonate]] with an acrylic polymer medium [[latex]], a [[pigment]] and other chemicals that ensure flexibility, and increase archival life. It is technically not ''gesso'' at all&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o23u0SuRLxsC&amp;pg=PA321 ''The Painter's Handbook: A Complete Reference'', by Mark David Gottsegen. p. 321] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603155459/https://books.google.com/books?id=o23u0SuRLxsC&amp;pg=PA321 |date=June 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkf05ZPoysC&amp;pg=PA56 |author=Michael Friel |title=Still Life Painting Atelier: An Introduction to Oil Painting|publisher= Random House Digital, Inc| page =58 |via=Books.google.com |date=2010 |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its non-absorbent acrylic polymer base makes it incompatible with media that require traditional gesso such as egg tempera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU56YgWzIM8C&amp;pg=PA33 |author=Altoon Sultan|title= Luminous Brush: Painting with Egg Tempera| page =33 |via=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sold premixed for both [[sizing]] and priming panels and flexible [[canvas]] for [[painting]]. While it does contain calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to increase the absorbency of the primer coat, [[titanium dioxide]] or "titanium white" is often added as the whitening agent.

Acrylic gesso can be colored, either commercially by replacing the titanium white with another pigment, such as [[carbon black]], or by the artist directly, with the addition of an acrylic paint. Acrylic gesso can be odorous, due to the presence of [[ammonia]] and/or [[formaldehyde]], which are added in small amounts as preservatives. Art supply manufacturers market canvases pre-primed with gesso.

''The Painter's Handbook'' notes a problem with using oil paints over an acrylic gesso ground instead of a traditional oil ground, citing a mismatch in flexibility over time that could cause the oil paint to delaminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Revised, Expanded| publisher = Watson-Guptill| isbn = 978-0-8230-3496-3| last = Gottsegen| first = Mark David| title = Painter's Handbook: Revised and Expanded| location = New York| date = 2006| page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Green Wheat Field with Cypress''''' (French: '''''Champ de blé vert avec cyprès''''') is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was completed in 1889, while van Gogh was voluntarily incarcerated at the asylum of St. Paul near [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] in [[Provence]]. Several paintings of [[Wheat Field with Cypresses|wheat fields with cypresses]] were made when van Gogh was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|affinty with wheat fields]]; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration.

In mid-June 1889, Vincent wrote to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]] that he had just completed the painting: {{quote|Then yet another [landscape] depicts a field of yellowing wheat surrounded by brambles and green bushes. At the end of the field a little pink house with a tall and dark cypress tree that stands out against the distant purplish and bluish hills, and against a [[forget-me-not]] blue sky streaked with pink whose pure tones contrast with the already heavy, scorched ears, whose tones are as warm as the crust of a loaf of bread."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let780/letter.html Letter 780] To Willemien van Gogh. Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, Sunday, 16 June 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the composition is similar to several paintings by [[Monet]], [[Renoir]], [[Sisley]] and [[Pissarro]], Ronald Pickvance says that "compared to high [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] practice, color is used more locally and the brushstrokes are more organic and vigorously hatched." However, "with no spatial distortions, no excessively heightened color tonalities, and no revolutionary symbolism, this landscape affirms its normality within an Impressionist convention. It neither manifests psychological tension nor projects a morbid vision."&lt;ref name="Pickvance1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pickvance|first=Ronald |title=Van Gogh in Saint-Rémy and Auvers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXlLAFG2kFIC&amp;pg=PA97|year=1986|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-477-7|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hamilton King Award''' is an annual award, presented to one individual, for excellence in illustration by the [[Society of Illustrators]].

== History ==

The Hamilton King Award was established in 1965 by Mrs. Hamilton King in memory of her husband through a bequest and is presented annually for the best illustration in the annual exhibition executed by a member of the [[Society of Illustrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Society of Illustrators | url=http://www.societyillustrators.org/HamiltonKing.aspx?id=140 | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton King (1871–1941)&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00098749?rskey=dp4IvD&amp;result=9 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent illustrator who worked in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanartarchives.com/king,h.htm americanartarchives]&lt;/ref&gt; King illustrated the "[[Coca-Cola]] girls" for calendars from 1910 to 1913. The Coca-Cola calendar work was considered significant because the artist's signature appeared in all printed matter for Coca-Cola, including serving trays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Famous Artists Who Have Worked With Coca-Cola | url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-lore-commissioned-artists | date=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King became well known for his "Hamilton King Girls", significantly working on behalf of [http://www.metmuseum.org/en/collections/search-the-collections?&amp;what=Color+lithographs&amp;who=Turkish+Trophies+Cigarettes&amp;pg=1 Turkish Trophies Cigarettes]. A majority of this collection is held by [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Metropolitan Museum of Art | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections?ft=*&amp;amp;who=Hamilton+King | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional collections of the artist are held by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Smithsonian Institution | url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=Hamilton%20King&amp;sType=%22phrase%22 | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holy Grail''' or '''San Graal tapestries''' are a set of six [[tapestry|tapestries]] depicting scenes from the legend of [[King Arthur]] and the quest for the [[Holy Grail]].  The tapestries were commissioned from [[Morris &amp; Co.]] by [[William Knox D'Arcy]] in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall,&lt;ref&gt;Stanmore Hall, a [[Gothic Revival]] house of the 1840s, stood in [[Stanmore]], Middlesex, northwest of London; commissions at Stanmore are discussed by Susan Moore, "The Marxist and the Oilman: Morris &amp; Co. at Stanmore Hall", ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'', '''178''', no. 4604 (14 November 1985:1494-96).&lt;/ref&gt; outside London.&lt;ref name="Morris Textiles"&gt;Parry (1983), pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burne-Jones"&gt;Wood (1997), pp. 116–18&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional versions of the tapestries with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris &amp; Co. over the next decade.

==The series==

The six original tapestries illustrate the story of the Grail quest as told in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]''.  Like other Morris &amp; Co. tapestries, the Holy Grail sequence was a group effort, with overall composition and figures designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[heraldry]] by [[William Morris]], and foreground florals and backgrounds by [[John Henry Dearle]].&lt;ref name="Morris Textiles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burne-Jones" /&gt; The narrative panels were accompanied by smaller verdure or woodland panels featuring deer, the knights' shields hung on trees, and text telling the story of the panel hung above. The sequence was worked over a period of five years, from 1891 to 1894, at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]].  The ''Attainment'' was the first of the series to be completed, and was shown at the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society|Arts and Crafts Exhibition]] in 1893.&lt;ref name="Morris Textiles" /&gt;

The six tapestries are:
* ''The [[Knights of the Round Table]] Summoned to the Quest by the Strange Damsel''
* ''The Arming and Departure of the Knights''
* ''The Failure of Sir [[Lancelot|Launcelot]] to enter the Chapel of the Holy Grail''
* ''The Failure of Sir [[Gawain]]e: Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine at the Ruined Chapel''
* ''The Ship''
* ''The Attainment: The Vision of the Holy Grail to Sir [[Galahad]], Sir [[Bors]], and Sir [[Percival|Perceval]]'' (also known as ''The Achievement of the Grail'' or ''The Achievement of Sir Galahad, accompanied by Sir Bors, and Sir Perceval'')&lt;ref name="Morris Textiles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burne-Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildman (1993), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile historian Linda Parry wrote of the series "their design, decoration and weaving establish them, beyond doubt, as the most significant tapestry series woven in the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name="Morris Textiles" /&gt;

The original set of tapestries remained at Stanmore Hall until D'Arcy's death in 1920.  They were subsequently sold and dispersed.  Morris &amp; Co. wove a second subset of the narrative panels  in 1895 and 1896 for the drawing room at Compton Hall, Lawrence Hodson's seat near [[Wolverhampton]].  A third complete set was woven for [[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] in 1898 and 1899.  Some hangings from these subsequent weavings are in the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Morris Textiles" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild and Leary (1981), p. 107-109&lt;/ref&gt; Others are in the collection of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/sep/17/3 ''Guardian''] accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stanmore Hall weaving of ''The Attainment'' was purchased by guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] in 1978; the piece failed to meet its reserve at auction in 2008 and remains in Page's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/2146345.walthamstow_william_morris_tapestry_fails_to_sell_at_auction/ ''Guardian''] accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theearthlyparadise.com/2008/03/jimmy-page-collects-pre-raphaelite-art.html The Earthly Paradise] accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homestead Book Company''' was a publisher and wholesale distributor of books, magazines, videos, games, and novelty items. Founded in 1972 and closed in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.homesteadbook.com/ Homestead Book Company] official site, accessed 2017-06-13&lt;/ref&gt; the organization was located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. They specialized in [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]] books and currently distribute over 3,000 titles to retailers as well as their own [[Mail order|mail-order]] business.

==History==
[[File:Seattle - Homestead Book Company 03.jpg|thumb|left|Homestead Book Company, 6101 22nd Avenue NW, in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.]]
Homestead Book Company was founded in 1972 by David Tatelman. They began as a distributor of underground comix for [[Rip Off Press]]. Tatelman initially delivered comix to various accounts between [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] and [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Steve Krupp’s Curio Shoppe | title=Seattle Simpleton Tabloid No.1 (1975) |url=http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=VC_simpleton1&amp;Category_Code=| accessdate = 17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon began distributing books with their first book being ''The Complete Guide to Growing Marijuana'' by David Fleming. Homestead Book Company was also one of the first distributors for ''[[High Times|High Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="OurHis"/&gt;

== Mushroom kits ==
During the Teononacatl Mushroom Conference in 1977, Tatelman met with author Bob Harris and they decided to start offering home grown [[Psilocybe]] mushroom kits. The kits were introduced with growing methods that were outlined in Harris' book ''Growing Wild Mushrooms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=The Vaults of Erowid | title=Mushroom Pioneers – Bob Harris | url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/mushroom_pioneers/mushroom_pioneers14.shtml | accessdate = 17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first kits were introduced in 1978 and sold through advertisements in ''High Times Magazine''. The kits are still on the market and are now referred to by the name EZ-Gro Mushroom Kits.&lt;ref name="OurHis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Hunt Slonem''' (born '''Hunt Slonim''', July 18, 1951) is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker. He is best known for his [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionist]] paintings of tropical birds, often based on a personal aviary in which he has been keeping from 30 to over 100 live birds of various species. Slonem's works are included in many important museum collections all over the world; he is exhibiting regularly at both public and private venues, and he has received numerous honors and awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousebooks.com/site/?p=8923 Pleasure Palaces: The Art and Homes of Hunt Slonem ''[[powerHouse Books]]'' Official web site]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Hunt Slonem was born in [[Kittery, Maine]], in an [[upper middle class]] family, the eldest of four children. His father was a Navy officer, and mother – a homemaker who spent much of her time doing volunteer work. As a result of his father's military career, Slonem's family moved around as frequently as every two to three years. He lived in Hawaii, Virginia, Connecticut, California and Washington State. Slonem's grandmother was a Tennessee native who married a Minnesota-born amateur artist and educator who became the Superintendent of Public Schools in [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. It was Slonem's grandfather who always encouraged young Hunt to paint.  "I grew up around painting, and my parents dabbled in painting themselves. I was given paints as a child, and I wanted to be a painter from first grade onwards," Slonem told the online magazine ''Art Interview''. His younger brother, Jeffrey Slonim, is a prolific journalist, and contributing editor of the ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview Magazine]]'', and his cousin is the best-selling author [[Tama Janowitz]].&lt;ref name="Art Interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.art-interview.com/Issue_014/interview_Slonem_Hunt.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117074723/http://www.art-interview.com/Issue_014/interview_Slonem_Hunt.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-17|title=Hunt Slonem|date=Spring 2012|publisher=''Art Interview online Magazine''|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing school, which included living in [[Nicaragua]] as an exchange student when he was 16 years old, Slonem commenced undergraduate studies at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He then spent about six months of his sophomore year at the [[Universidad de las Américas Puebla|University of the Americas]] in [[San Andrés Cholula, Puebla]], Mexico, but later graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Painting]] and [[Art History]] from [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He also took courses at the reputable [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] in Maine, where he was exposed to such influential artists from the New York area as [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Jack Levine]], and [[Al Held]]. During that period, Slonem altered the "i" to an "e" in his family name as a nod to [[numerology]]. He moved to New York in 1973 to further his art practice, and [[Manhattan]] had become his consistent base ever since.&lt;ref name="Art Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pmc-mag.com/2012/03/hunt-slonem/|title=HOUSES AS MUSES |work=[[Patrick McMullan|PMc Magazine]] |date=March 2012|first=Jeffrey |last=Slonim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{quote|I would say my whole life could be summed up by the word 'exotica'.|Hunt Slonem&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/hunt-slonem-acadian-dreams|title=Lincoln is Hunt Slonem's Marilyn |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] Magazine |date=December 2011|first=Clare|last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hunt Slonem's artistic career began in New York, in the late 1970s. When he first came to Manhattan, in 1973, he was hired by the Department of Social Services to teach painting to senior citizens. He was unhappy at his job and seriously considered moving to Amsterdam when, unexpectedly, in 1975, he got a call from artist [[Janet Fish]] who offered him her studio for the summer.&lt;ref name="Art Interview"/&gt; That telephone call turned Slonem's life around. Shortly afterwards, In 1976, Hunt Slonem received a painting grant from the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and began painting in earnest. His first solo show was held at New York's Harold Reed Gallery in 1977, followed by a major exhibition at the prestigious [[Fischbach Gallery]]. As Slonem's career progressed, he was introduced to people like [[Andy Warhol]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Sylvia Miles]], and [[Truman Capote]]. Through Jeffrey Slonim, who would later serve as an usher at Andy Warhol's funeral, he also met and befriended the Belgian-born actress Monique van Vooren, the star of Warhol's film ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein]]''. He soon became a habitué of New York's trendiest hot spots and an active participant in the city's burgeoning art scene.&lt;ref name="Art Interview"/&gt;

Slonem's move to New York had a profound influence on his development as an artist. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', he fell in love with "a very particular kind of New York life, one most people can only fantasize about. But people this determinedly unusual do exist here, and that is one of the city's surest charms. They feed off the city and the city feeds off them." Novelist [[Tama Janowitz]] put it succinctly, saying, "His pictures are the subtext of Manhattan, an imaginary, vivid and grotesquely evocative world that bubbles beneath the paved-over, gray city of New York which he physically inhabits -- a city where people have come from all over the world, bringing their images of other places and other lives with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/nyregion/about-new-york-this-artist-draws-inspiration-from-his-birds-all-72-of-them.html?scp=5&amp;sq=%22hunt+slonem%22&amp;st=nyt |title=About New York; This Artist Draws Inspiration From His Birds, All 72 of Them|work=The [[New York Times]] |date=25 December 1991 |first=Douglas|last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite living in the heart of Manhattan,  Slonem remained true to his boyhood fascination with exotica, which he had developed as a youth in Hawaii and during his time as a foreign exchange student in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]]. His paintings expressed a strong affinity for nature, especially the various species of exotic butterflies and tropical birds living on the island. He soon became well known for creating grisaille paintings of small birds in their cages.  He often painted them wet-on-wet and grit off the surfaces to denote wire enclosures after the birds had been strategically placed. Art critic [[Roberta Smith]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' that Slonem's "witty [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] strategy meshes the creatures into the picture plane and sometimes nearly obliterates them as images, but it also suspends and shrouds them in a dim, atmospheric light that is quite beautiful. If [[Joseph Cornell]] had concentrated on painting, the results might have looked like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/25/arts/review-art-condo-creates-a-future-with-layers-of-nostalgia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Review/Art |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=25 March 1988 |first=Roberta |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds also fill the surface of his largest project yet – a 6-foot by 86 foot [[mural]] he painted for the iconic [[Bryant Park|Bryant Park Grill Restaurant]] in New York City, completed in 1995.&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt; According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "The most notable aspect of the [restaurant's] interior is an 86-foot long mural by the artist Hunt Slonem, which depicts hundreds of birds, similar to those found in the artist's studio, where he can be found painting away with a bird or two perched on his shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1995/06/19/1995_06_19_032_TNY_CARDS_000370644 |title=Miracle on 42nd Street |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=19 June 1995 |first=Brendan |last=Gill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt Slonem's oil paintings pivot between the fantastic and the natural. These natural forms ultimately become the subjects for many of his artworks, appearing in large lavishly colored paintings and constructed sculptures. As an artist, he endeavors to explore the many expressive faculties of color. His paintings are layered with thick brushstrokes of vivid color, often cut into in a cross-hatched pattern that adds texture to the overall surface of the painting. Slonem often hides his subjects "behind a grid of incised lines, blurring their contours and emphasizing the paint's tactile quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEFD7153EF930A25752C1A9639C8B63&amp;scp=21&amp;sq=%22hunt+slonem%22&amp;st=nyt |title=Art Review; Landscapes: Fantastic, Elemental Or Formal |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=13 November 2005 |first=Helen A. |last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surface patterning combines with the rich colors and recognizable subject matter to create paintings that are physically and aesthetically rich. Poet and critic [[John Ashbery]] observed, "From the narrow confines of his grids, half cage, half perch, Slonem summons dazzling explosions of the variable life around us that need only to be looked at in order to spring into being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ashbery|Ashbery, John]]. "Hunt's Place", ''Didegnodiverso'', Turin, Italy, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonem's obsessive and repetitive rendering of his subjects reflects his desire to explore issues of spatial complexity, compression and density in what the acclaimed [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] curator [[Henry Geldzahler]] deemed "a consistent investigation of post-cubist abstraction."&lt;ref name ="Henry"&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler|Geldzahler, Henry]]. "Hunt Slonem", ''Kunst Editions/Jano Group'', New York, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The repetitive imagery also makes a reference to Andy Warhol. "I was influenced by Warhol's repetition of soup cans and Marilyn," says Slonem. "But I'm more interested in doing it in the sense of prayer, with repetition... It's really a form of worship."&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; He is not interested in realism or, unlike Warhol, in advertising or media, and his paintings are neither narrative nor specific in detail. Rather, Slonem's work is deeply rooted in the act of painting. His jarring color choices, spontaneous mark making, and scratched hatch marks are the result of his ongoing fascination with the manipulation and implementation of paint. For Slonem, cross-hatching has "a feeling of a tapestry, it's like weaving. I'm making colors bleed into each other, I'm revealing the under-painting. I'm making these marks to allow the light to come through, basically. So you're seeing about five levels of paint, instead of one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.studio360.org/2012/feb/24/hunt-slonems-artist-aviary/ |title=Hunt Slonem's Artist Aviary |work=Studio360.org |date=24 February 2012|first=Kurt |last=Andersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this kind of devotion to the process of painting that prompted Henry Geldzahler to observe in 1993 that "Slonem is a painter, a painter's painter with an enormous bag of technical tricks which become apparent to the viewer the longer he stands before the work."&lt;ref name ="Henry"/&gt;

Another recurring theme of Slonem's pictorial work is portrait painting, and that of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in particular. He is interested in history and memorabilia, and for him, the "larger-than-life" Lincoln is a catchall. In Slonem's words, "On [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn [Monroe]]]'s desk, she had a picture of her mother and a picture of Lincoln. And she said, 'I really didn't know who my father was, so it might as well be Abraham Lincoln.'" According to the ''[[Interview|Interview Magazine]]'', "Slonem's portraits of Lincoln feel personal, and in surprising ways, he's close to the long-deceased." "I work with diviners and mystics, and one of them started channeling Lincoln in my house," says Slonem. "[Lincoln] guided me to paint certain things, like my doves: he wanted me to paint them as a symbol of freedom."&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, Slonem began working on a new series of so-called "Rabbit paintings."  The idea for this critically acclaimed series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2010-01-28/culture/check-out-hunt-slonem-s-rabbit-art-at-the-coral-springs-museum/|title=Check Out Hunt Slonem's Rabbit Art at the Coral Springs Museum |work=[[New Times Broward-Palm Beach]] |date=28 January 2010|first=Michael|last=Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to him after he had discovered that the year of his birth, 1951, was the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|year of the Rabbit]] in the [[Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac calendar]]. He often repeats imagery in this series, just like in his other series, because, he told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the act is similar to spiritual meditation: "Mantras are holy because you repeat them." This theme continued to inspire Slonem over the years, and the series is as prominent in his work today as it was over thirty years ago.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

Apart from painting, Slonem is also making sculptures, like the sizable, "Tocos," an 18-foot acrylic and aluminum tower of toucans exhibited at the [[Polk Museum of Art]] in 2012. He has also restored several historic houses. "I consider it part of my art form,"  Slonem said in an interview with ''NewsChief.com''.  His "art form" also includes [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] furniture - in his homes, studios, and exhibits. In 2009, [[Bergdorf Goodman]], a luxury department store in New York City, recreated Slonem's distinct art-filled living room for its windows display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/bergdorf-goodman-x-hunt-slonem/25365 |title=Bergdorf Goodman x Hunt Slonem |work=Herald de Paris |date=26 February 2009|first=Julia|last=Chesky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Slonem's view, "Art incorporated with furniture becomes a work of art itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newschief.com/article/20120119/NEWSCHIEF/201195025?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar |title=Hunt Slonem exhibit on display at Polk Museum of Art through March |work=NewsChief.com |date=16 January 2012|first=Donna|last=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, German automaker [[Audi]] enlisted Hunt Slonem to create an exclusive design for its sleek new [[Audi A5|A5 coupe]], and he created a one-of-a-kind design based on one of his oil painting for the car's exterior. "It's an earlier work of mine with birds flying through the sky; the original work is in the collection of the [[Colby College Museum of Art|Colby Museum]] in Maine, where I was born," said Slonem of the piece, which is painted in blues, blacks, reds, and whites with cockatoos. The mobile artwork was unveiled in conjunction with the [[New York International Auto Show]] at the Audi Forum in Manhattan. The "Hunt Slonem Audi A5," as it was dubbed, then toured Audi dealerships throughout the United States, before returning to New York where it was auctioned off to benefit a cancer research charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fashionweekdaily.com/the-fix/article/21145 |title=Hunt Slonem's Creative Car|date=14 February 2008 |publisher=''[[Daily Front Row]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Albert Maysles]], the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary filmmaker ([[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]], [[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]], [[Grey Gardens]]), announced that he will be shooting a feature-length [[documentary]] on Hunt Slonem's life and his art.&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt;

In 2014, he collaborated with fashion accessories company [[Echo Design Group]] for a limited edition scarf and handbag collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msfabulous.com/2014/08/echo-design-hunt-slonem-collaboration.html |title=Echo Design &amp; Hunt Slonem Collaboration|date=8 August 2014 |publisher=''[[Ms. Fabulous]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum exhibitions and collections==

Hunt Slonem's paintings are widely represented in important private collections all over the world. According to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "Slonem's work has attracted many well-known [Hollywood] art collectors including [[Sharon Stone]], [[Gina Gershon]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Kate Hudson]], and [[J.Lo]]", among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/photo/Painter-Hunt-Slonem-poses-for-a-portrait-with-his-2337471.php|title=Hunt Slonem Gallery a bright addition to SoMa |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "I'm a big fan of Hunt's work," Brooke Shields told ''[[Daily Front Row]]''.

==Personal life==

Hunt Slonem has never been married and has no children. Until 2010, he occupied a Tenth Street studio in Manhattan that was 40,000 square feet, divided into 89 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1S9SxfyPmE |title=Hunt Slonem |work=Men.Style.com |date=7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Slonem moved to a 15,000 square foot fourth floor former headquarters of the film company Moviola, on West 45th Street. The space served as his painting studio and was divided into a number of small rooms, all of which Slonem painted in old Louisiana plantation-house colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hunt-slonems-studio/|title=Hunt Slonem's Studio |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] Magazine|date=24 February 2012|first=Hunt |last=Slonem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio housed his ever-expanding quirky collections, from [[Neo-Gothic]] chairs to top hats, to marble busts of [[Marie Antoinette]], to various [[Objet d'art|''objets d'art'']], mined from flea markets and antique fairs. In an interview in Vincent Katz's book ''Pleasure Palaces: The Art &amp; Homes of Hunt Slonem,'' he describes his collecting technique as "cluttering."&lt;ref name ="Katz"&gt;Katz, Vincent. ''Pleasure Palaces: The Art &amp; Homes of Hunt Slonem,'' ''[[powerHouse Books]]'', New York, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  For him, objects are "friends;" the more there are, the more he is inspired. "I have to have a certain amount of stuff in place before I can function and paint," he says.&lt;ref name="NYM"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/homedesign/greatrooms/64276/|title=Living With a Thousand Best Friends|work= [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |date=28 February 2010 |first=Wendy|last=Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Slonem still lives in the loft apartment he moved into in 1973, according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he does nearly all his entertaining at his new 25,000 square foot West 34th Street studio in the industrial [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of Manhattan where he moved in 2011. He christened the third floor loft space with a birthday party attended by more than 200 people.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204190504577040280261991196|title=An Oddball Menagerie|work= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date=19 November 2011 |first=Kelly|last=Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt Slonem also owns two historically important Louisiana plantations—one called [[Albania Plantation House|Albania Plantation]], on the [[Bayou Teche]] in [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]], about two hours' drive northwest of [[New Orleans]], and the other – the Lakeside Plantation, in a remote location near the town of Batchelor, one hour north of [[Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref name ="Katz"/&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', the Batchelor property includes "an 1832 plantation house called Lakeside, pink if you please, as surprising in this community of shoebox houses as an aged diva in a pink organdy dress at McDonald's. Also as indifferent, inasmuch as a house can be indifferent, to the bruising of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31hunt.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=Southern Gothic: Ghosts Welcome|work=The [[New York Times]] |date=31 May 2007 |first=Joyce|last=Wadler}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once owned by [[Marquis de La Fayette]] whose close relationship with lifelong friends such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Monroe]], [[John Adams]], and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]] played a pivotal role in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  In a show of gratitude, the United States gave La Fayette land which is known today as Lakeside Plantation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acadianmuseum.com/marquis.html Acadian Museum Exhibit: 2007 Marquis de La Fayette Commemoration: “The Overlooked Legacy of La Fayette: The Louisiana Purchase” [[Erath, Louisiana|Acadian Museum]] Official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The property is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Louisiana]].

The '''Institute of Videography''' ('''IOV''') is a UK-registered, not-for-profit trade association for professional [[videographers]].  Its membership predominantly operates in the [[corporate video]], [[wedding videography]] and special interest video ([[documentary]]) markets - but extends into every area of media production. 

==History==

The IOV recognised the need to provide an association of like-minded professionals within the, then, developing videography market. The IOV and its list of membership benefits soon expanded, and the organisation adopted its present incorporated form and constitution in June 1991.
Today, the IOV is owned by its members and managed by a board of elected Executive Members.

'''John Prentiss Benson''' (also '''John P. Benson''') (1865–1947) was an American architect and artist noted for his maritime paintings.

==Early life==

Benson was born into a prosperous family in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].  He was trained as an architect at the [[Académie Julian]] and the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]].  He was the brother of [[Frank Weston Benson]].  He married Sarah Bissell Whitman in 1893; they lived in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] and then in [[Flushing, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033027/http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Upon his return from Paris, Benson was employed by [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] in New York City. He and Albert Leverett Brockway, a fellow architecture student from his Paris days, soon formed their own firm, Benson and Brockway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033027/http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For six months between 1904 and 1905, Benson created "The Woozlebeasts," a comic strip written almost entirely in limericks, accompanied by his nonsensical drawings. These were influenced by [[Edward Lear]]'s [[literary nonsense]], but took an even more fantastical angle. Some of these strips were collected in book form, &lt;i&gt;The Woozlebeasts&lt;/i&gt;. New York: Moffat, Yard &amp; Co., 1905.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nonsenselit.org/john-prentiss-benson/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 at Benson and his wife traveled to England where he rented a studio and painted several pictures. He shipped them to New York's [[Kennedy Galleries]], and when they sold he became a full-time painter. Benson and his wife moved to a house they called "Willowbank" on the [[Piscataqua River]] in [[Kittery, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033027/http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the [[Harmony Grove Cemetery]] in Salem, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://salem.essexcountyma.net/HarmonyGroveCemetery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A retrospective John Benson exhibition was held in 1968 at the [[Peabody Museum of Salem|Peabody Museum]] in Salem, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033027/http://www.johnpbenson.org/jpbenson/aboutjpb.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Chasse''''', also referred to as '''''The Hunt''''', is a painting created in 1911 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. The work was exhibited at the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]] (no. 610); [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]], Moscow, 1912; the Salon de la [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], Rouen, summer 1912; the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie, 1912 (no. 37), ''Le Cubisme'', [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris, 1953 (no. 64 bis), and several major exhibitions during subsequent years.

In 1913 the painting was reproduced in ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations esthétiques]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].

Executed in a highly dynamic [[Cubism|Cubist]] style, with multiple faceted views, the work nevertheless retains recognizable elements relative to its subject matter.

==Description==
''La Chasse'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 123.2 by 99&amp;nbsp;cm (48.5 x 39 inches) signed "Albert Gleizes", lower right. Painted in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4531269 Christie's, Albert Gleizes, 1911, La Chasse, oil on canvas, 123.2 x 99 cm, Lot description ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this outdoor hunting scene the [[horizon]] line is almost on top of the canvas. Seven people are present, along with numerous animals.&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;P. Alibert, ''Albert Gleizes, naissance et avenir du cubisme'', Saint-Etienne, 1982, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; A man with a hunting horn (''Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur'') can be seen in the foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt; This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Le Dépiquage des Moissons, Harvest Threshing, oil on canvas, 269 x 353 cm, National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, Japan.jpg|thumb|300px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'', oil on canvas, 269 x 353 cm, [[National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo, Japan]]
With its epic subject matter—far removed from neutral themes of the ''fruit dish'', ''violin'', and ''seated nudes'' exhibited by Picasso and Braque in the private boutique of Kahnweiler—''The Hunt'' was destined form its very inception to be exhibited at the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]], at the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées; a huge public venue where several thousand viewers would see the works exhibited. Gleizes rarely painted still lifes, his epic interests usually finding sympathetic echos in more inclusive themes, such as ''La Chasse (The Hunt)'' and the monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Harvest Threshing (Le Dépiquage des Moissons)]]'' of 1912. He wished to create a heroic art, stripped of ornament and obscure allegory, an art dealing on the one hand with relevant subjects of modern life: crowds, man and machines, and ultimately, the city itself (based on observations of the real world). And on the other, he wished to project tradition and accumulated cultural thought (based on memory).&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes continually stressed subjects of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. He regarded the painting as a manifold where subjective consciousness and the objective nature of the physical world could not only coincide but also be resolved.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here Gleizes not only created a synthetic landscape, in which elements are placed in unreal but symbolic relationships to each other, but also created a synthesis of social experience, showing two distinct types of human use of the land. Le Fauconnier painted a similar subject [''Le Chasseur''] the following year. Dorival has suggested that the treatment of the horses may well be an important source for those of Duchamp-Villon in 1914. [...] In his [1916] attempt to organize in plastic terms the abstract equivalent of his earlier broad panoramas, Gleizes reverted to the tilting planes reminiscent of smaller ones in such volumetric cubist works as ''The Hunt'' and ''Jacques Nayral'', both of 1911. ([[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], Guggenheim, 1964)&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorival, B., ''Les Peintres du XXe siecle'', Paris, 1957, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meetings at the studio of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] include young painters who want to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Divisionist, or Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color. The hanging committee of the [[Salon des Indépendants]] ensure that the works of these painters with similar ambitions be shown together. Albert Gleizes, [[Jean Metzinger]], Henri Le Fauconnier, [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Marie Laurencin]] are shown together in Room 41 (''Salle 41''). [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] has become an enthusiastic supporter of the new group. The result of the exhibition is a major scandal.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The public is outraged by the apparent obscurity of the subject matter, and the predominance of the elementary geometrical shapes, which give rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although the term 'cube' has been used before with respect to the works of Metzinger (1906), Delaunay and Metzinger (1907), and [[Georges Braque]] (1908), this is the first time the word 'Cubism' is used. The designation becomes widespread as an artistic movement.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957. Reprinted, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Ampuis, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''"Cubisme"'' is accepted in June 1911 as the name of the new school by Guillaume Apollinaire, speaking in the context of the Brussels Indépendants which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Le Fauconnier and [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
Over the Summer of 1911, Gleizes, living and working in Courbevoie, is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Gleizes paints [[Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (Gleizes)|Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon]]. The two have extensive conversations about the nature of form and perception. Both are discontent with classical perspective, which they feel give only a partial idea of the subject matter as experienced in life, seen in movement and from many different angles.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

===1911 Salon d'Automne===

Exhibited at the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]]]]
[[File:Jean Metzinger, Le goûter, Tea Time, 1911, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1911, ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)|Le Goûter (Tea Time)]]'', oil on canvas, 75.9 x 70.2 cm (29 7/8 x 27 5/8 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Exhibited at the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]]. [[André Salmon]] dubbed this painting "The Mona Lisa of Cubism"]]
Following the [[Salon des Indépendants]] of early 1911, a new scandal is produced; this time in the Cubist room at the Salon d'Automne. Gleizes shows his [[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait de Jacques Nayral]] and ''La Chasse (The Hunt)''. Metzinger exhibits [[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]. Other artists join the ''Salle 41'' group: [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[František Kupka]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Francis Picabia]], occupying rooms 7 and 8 of the salon. At about the time of this exhibition, through the intermediary of Apollinaire, Gleizes meets Picasso and sees his work along with that of Braque for the first time. He gives his reaction in an essay published in ''La Revue Indépendante''. He considers that Picasso and Braque, despite the great value of their work, are engaged in an ''Impressionism of Form'', i.e., they give an appearance of formal construction which does not rest on any clearly comprehensible principle. [...] We went to Kahnweiler's for the first time and saw the canvasses of Braque and Picasso which, rightly or wrongly, did not thrill us. Their spirit, being the opposite of our own. [...] And as far as Kahnweiler is concerned I never again put my foot in his boutique after this first visit in 1911.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Jean Metzinger'', La Revue Indépendante, n°4, September 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Salon d'Automne, Gleizes becomes associated with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7 rue Lemaître in the Parisian suburb Puteaux, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, a regular meeting places for the Cubist group. The Puteaux studios share a garden with the studio of [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter who is developing a non-representational style based on music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The critic Jean Claude writes, in a review of the 1911 Salon d'Automne titled ''Cubistes, Triangulistes, Trapézoïdistes et Intentionnistes'', published in Le Petit Journal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a cubist art... Those who doubt can go into the room where enclosed are the productions of wild beasts [''fauves''] who practice it...

You will see there the ''Paysage lacustre'', by Le Fauconnier, the ''Jeune homme et Jeune fille dans le printemps'', mosaic of yellow, green, brown and pink, represented by small trapezoids of color, juxtaposed, the ''Paysage'' and ''Goûter'' by Jean Metzinger, classic cubist... A ''Marine'' by Lhote who invented the cubistic water. A ''figure nue'' by de la Fresnaye, which seems made with wooden bricks, and a mind-boggling ''Essai pour trois portraits'' by Fernand Léger. There too, Gleizes, a ''Chasse'' and a ''Portrait'', which I find deeply regrettable, because the author, once, proved he had talent.

Non of this would have any importance if these horrors did not take up space that could be usefully occupied by other works, and if, above all, a few snobs did not offer them to the crowds as the last canons of modern beauty. But, really, extravagance, has it ever been art? And can art survive without beauty and without nobility? The Cubists and other "artists" will hardly make us forget Ingres, Courbet or Delacroix. So much for them. To be continued. (Jean Claude)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k564111k/f5.image Jean Claude, ''Le Salon d'Automne, Cubistes, Triangulistes, Trapézoïdistes et Intentionnistes'', Le Petit Parisien, Numéro 12756, 2 October 1911], p. 5. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes later recalled of the two major 1911 Salons:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in 1911 that, ''for the first time'', the public was confronted with a collection of paintings ''which still did not have any label attached to them''. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

With the Salon d'Automne of that same year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent as it had been at the Indépendants. I remember this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled ''Le Goûter''; Léger his sombre ''Nus dans un Paysage''; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself ''La Chasse'' and the ''Portrait de Jacques Nayral''. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The winter season in Paris profited from all this to add a little spice to its pleasures. While the newspapers sounded the alarm to alert people to the danger, and while appeals were made to the public authorities to do something about it, song-writers, satirists and other men of wit and spirit, provoked great pleasure among the leisured classes by playing with the word 'cube', discovering that it was a very suitable means of inducing laughter which, as we all know, is the principle characteristic that distinguishes man from the animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The contagion, naturally, spread in proportion to the violence of the effort that was being put into stopping it. It quickly went beyond the frontiers of its country of origin. Public opinion throughout the world was occupied with Cubism. As people wanted to see what all the fuss was about, invitations to exhibit multiplied. From Germany, from Russia, from Belgium, from Switzerland, from Holland, from Austro-Hungary, from Bohemia, they came in great numbers. The painters accepted some of them and writers like Guillaume Apollinaire, Maurice Raynal, André Salmon, Alexandre Mercereau, the advocate-general Granié, supported them in their writings and in the talks they gave. (Albert Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', translation by Peter Brooke. Originally written by Gleizes in 1925 and published in a German version in 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', in a series called ''Bauhausbücher'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his review of the 1911 Salon d'Automne published in L'Intransigeant, written more as a counterattack in defense of Cubism, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] expressed his views on the entries of Metzinger and Gleizes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The imagination of Metzinger gave us this year two elegant canvases of tones and drawing that attest, at the very least, to a great culture... His art belongs to him now. He has vacated influences and his palette is of a refined richness. Gleizes shows us the two sides of his great talent: invention and observation. Take the example of ''Portrait de Jacques Nayral'', there is good resemblance, but there is not one form or color in this impressive painting that has not been invented by the artist. The portrait has a grandiose appearance that should not escape the notice of connoisseurs. This portrait covers [revêt] a grandiose appearance that should not elude connoisseurs... It is time that young painters turn towards  the sublime in their art. ''La Chasse'', by Gleizes, is well composed and of beautiful colors and sings [chantant].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k786131q/f2.image Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', L'Intransigeant, Numéro 11409, 10 October 1911, p. 2].

==Art market==
Gleizes had always detested the art market falsified by a speculation on works of art imposed by the fantasy of fictitious bids to push up the prices in the public sales. When [[Léonce Rosenberg]], whom Gleizes found the most sympathetic of the art dealers, offered to push up the price of his pre-war painting ''La Chasse'', which was coming up for auction. Gleizes replied that he preferred to buy it himself and therefore wanted the price to be as low as possible.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

'''Macro Sea''' is an American real estate development firm formed in 2009 by developer [[David Belt]]. Primarily known for its development of adaptive reuse and interim use projects, Macro Sea has been the subject of substantial media coverage recently because of its development of New Lab, Building 128 in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brooklyn Navy Yard Is Home to Manufacturing Cooperative|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/brooklyn-navy-yard-is-home-to-manufacturing-cooperative.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-05-08|access-date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Mcgeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From Relic to Beacon: Brooklyn Navy Yard Gets New Life as Cutting-Edge Manufacturing Hub|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231905|accessdate = 2015-10-02|first = Catherine|last = Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Manufacturing Renaissance at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|url = http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/08/a-manufacturing-renaissance-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their portfolio includes educational, arts, retail, residential buildings, student housing, and cultural centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = David Belt - One Thing Leads to Another|url = https://vimeo.com/91425413|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Although Macro Sea is often dubbed a "creative" company in news coverage, Belt, the firm's managing principal and founder, has tended to disagree with this description. In a recent interview he argued: "I think all developers should care about design. I’ve met super creative people in business, in law, in government, and the idea that artists have the only right to be creative is becoming less prevalent as the field of design and design impact becomes more ubiquitous in the business world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Innovator: Interview with David Belt of Macro Sea {{!}} Artinfo|url = http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1231264/the-innovator-interview-with-david-belt-of-macro-sea#|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the firm's official website, Macro Sea's mission is to: "pursue projects we find interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea — About|url = http://macro-sea.com/about/|website = macro-sea.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent lecture introduction at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning]], Venezuelan architect [[Mónica Ponce de León]], described Macro Sea as a development firm that "draws on a multi-disciplinary approach...to create real estate projects that make money, look good, and have meaning," that transforms "underused objects and areas into covetable destinations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = David Belt - One Thing Leads to Another|url = https://vimeo.com/91425413|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Organizationally, Macro Sea is unique in that it exists as a series of ongoing collaborations between experts in a wide variety of disciplines including lawyers, artists, architects, designers and others. The company has served as the entrepreneurial framework for most of Belt's development pursuits since 2009.

Early collaborators included Jocko Weyland (2009-2011), Alix Feinkind (2009-2012), Elise DeChard (2011–2013), and Alexandra Escamilla (2012-2014). Currently the firm is composed of Belt, Rebecca Birmingham who serves as Creative Director and General Counsel (2010–present), Nicko Elliott as Design Director (2013–present), Liz Song as Designer and Project Manager (2015–present), Studio Director Stephanie Hemshrot (2014–present), and Special Projects Coordinator Allison Moss (2016-present).

==Notable projects==

=== New Lab ===

The result of a public-private partnership with the City of [[New York City|New Yor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;k, [[New Lab]] is a repurposing of Building 128 in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], which was a boiler and machine shop for shipmaking during most of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History  : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|url = http://brooklynnavyyard.org/the-navy-yard/history/|website = brooklynnavyyard.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a design and new manufacturing facility for companies and individuals creating products and hardware, many of which use [[additive manufacturing]] technologies. New Lab opened in June 2016 and has received substantial recent coverage in the media because of its significant role in attracting new industry back to the once dormant [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brooklyn Navy Yard Is Home to Manufacturing Cooperative|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/brooklyn-navy-yard-is-home-to-manufacturing-cooperative.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-05-08|access-date = 2015-10-01|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Mcgeehan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From Relic to Beacon: Brooklyn Navy Yard Gets New Life as Cutting-Edge Manufacturing Hub|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231905|accessdate = 2015-10-01|first = Catherine|last = Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Manufacturing Renaissance at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|url = http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/08/a-manufacturing-renaissance-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Design Brooklyn|url = http://design-brooklyn.tumblr.com/|website = Design Brooklyn|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== G27 Global Institute ===
[[File:MacroSeaG27BerlinGlobalInstituteExterior.jpg|left|thumb|Exterior of G27 Global Institute]]

Located in the historic Kreuzberg neighborhood in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea: G27|url = http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2015/09/01/macro_sea_g27.html|website = domusweb.it|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; G27 Global Institute is a "design-centric"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 CIEE Global Institute / Macro Sea|url = http://www.archdaily.com/772841/g27-ciee-global-institute-macro-sea|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; residence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 Academic Campus &amp; Student Housing  DBI Projects|url = http://projects.dbinyc.com/g27-academic-campus-student-housing/|website = projects.dbinyc.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for study-abroad students. The project confronts the current design paradigm of student housing as it is, according to Belt, "one of the most overlooked and under-explored design disciplines. At its best, it's institutional and sterile and at its worst is confined to dilapidated couches and condescending amenities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Innovator: Interview with David Belt of Macro Sea {{!}} Artinfo|url = http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1231264/the-innovator-interview-with-david-belt-of-macro-sea#|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent article in Slate magazine said the project was indicative of a major paradigm shift in student housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Berlin’s New Stylish Student Housing Doesn’t Look Anything Like Standard Dingy Dorms|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/09/22/g27_global_institute_from_macro_sea_and_ciee_are_stylish_digs_for_study.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2015-09-22|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 1091-2339|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Macro Sea's theme of finding buildings that have a history with which a forthcoming project will resonate, the firm identified the former Roka manufacturing complex in Berlin.

In order to realize their vision, Macro Sea and sister firm DBI Projects completely gutted and renovated the 85,000 sq. ft. complex and courtyard. Roka's facility would be transformed into "a five-story front building located at 27 Gneisenaustrasse, home to future administrative offices and faculty apartments, and a large six-story factory building set back from the street and separated by a magnificent tree-lined interior courtyard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 CIEE Global Institute / Macro Sea|url = http://www.archdaily.com/772841/g27-ciee-global-institute-macro-sea|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MacroSeaG27BerlinGobalInstituteInterior.jpg|thumb|G27 Global Institute interior]]

Macro Sea conceived G27 "as a veritable vertical campus, meaning that spaces for living, academic classes, dining and socializing are configured in a vertical fashion, creating a campus within a building."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Innovator: Interview with David Belt of Macro Sea {{!}} Artinfo|url = http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1231264/the-innovator-interview-with-david-belt-of-macro-sea#|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of G27 consists of contemporary, custom-made and vintage furniture of Bavarian and Danish origin. Many of the furnishings are repurposed local items and salvaged objects from the original facility. From a design perspective G27 is laid out to encourage interaction between students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea: G27|url = http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2015/09/01/macro_sea_g27.html|website = domusweb.it|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus orients around an open common room that contains a large fireplace and a marble bar and cafe. The residential portion of the building will house 200 people and the rooms and bathrooms are customizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Old Factory Becomes Germany's College Housing of the Future {{!}} The Creators Project|url = http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/an-old-factory-becomes-germanys-college-housing-of-the-future|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; G27 opened for the Fall 2015 semester and has been leased to the [[Council on international educational exchange|Council on International Educational Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G27 CIEE Global Institute / Macro Sea|url = http://www.archdaily.com/772841/g27-ciee-global-institute-macro-sea|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Macro Sea)|url = http://designandviolence.moma.org/glassphemy-macro-sea/|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was set up in a private space in [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]], as a 20' x 30' steel and bulletproof glass structure provided a means to "make recycling a more direct, visceral experience and to purge some New York aggression simultaneously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Eco-Friendly Aggression at David Belt’s Glassphemy!|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/arts/design/12glass.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2010-05-11|access-date = 2015-10-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Melena|last = Ryzik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were afforded the opportunity to throw glass bottles at one another without harm. Standing at one end of a raised platform those involved could hurl their bottles at people standing or walking by on the lower opposite platform, but with the protection of the bulletproof glass.

Design and installation on the project was the collaborative effort of Vamos Architects, John Wischmann, Paul Maiello, and Jason Krugman. It was made of plexiglass, steel, wood, responsive light installation, and glass bottles. Glassphemy! was featured in the 2013 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Design and Violence Exhibition and book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://designandviolence.moma.org/glassphemy-macro-sea/|title = MoMA|date = 4 December 2013|accessdate = 19 September 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Manaugh|first = Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile Pools ===
[[File:MacroSeaDumpsterPools2009.JPG|thumb|MacroSeaDumpsterPools2009|left]]
Macro Sea's 2009-2010 mobile pool project, sometimes referred to as the "dumpster pools"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/tag/dumpster%20pools%20new%20york|title = Vice|date = August 5, 2015|accessdate = 2015-10-15|website = vice.com|publisher = |last = Smith|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first projects the firm undertook and served as a "way to experiment with underused space and materials, repurposing them with urban renewal in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macro Sea — Mobile Pools|url = http://macro-sea.com/projects/mobile-pools-2010/#1|website = macro-sea.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pools were made from donated dumpsters which were readily available due to the economic downturn at the time. They were cleaned, sealed with plastic liners, and given filtration systems much like those found on above ground pools in other parts of the country. Belt, Jocko Weyland and Alix Feinkind used the idea as a "template for a larger idea: turning eyesore strip malls into artsy community destinations, with Dumpster pools and other indie attractions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Forget the Trash Bag, Bring a Towel to the Dumpster Pools|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/design/20pool.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-07-19|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Melena|last = Ryzik}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the firm had plans to repurpose a strip mall in Atlanta, Georgia, with a similar adaptive aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Forget the Trash Bag, Bring a Towel to the Dumpster Pools|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/design/20pool.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-07-19|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Melena|last = Ryzik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, in 2010, the New York City Mayor’s Office and the Department of Transportation invited Macro Sea to participate in NYC’s Annual Summer Streets event. The pools were set up at the [[Park Avenue Viaduct]], on the east side of Park Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, for three Saturdays in August 2010. Hundreds of New Yorkers came out to swim over the course of the three weekends. In 2011 the pools were featured in the Venice Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = US Pavilion at Venice Biennale Focuses on Design Actions for Common Good|url = http://inhabitat.com/us-pavilion-at-venice-biennale-will-focus-on-design-actions-for-common-good/|accessdate = 2015-09-25|first = Andrew|last = Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monteverde Angel''' or '''Angel of [[Resurrection of Jesus|the Resurrection]]''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] ''Angelo di Monteverde'' and ''Angelo della Resurrezione'') is the name given to a [[marble]] statue of 1882 that guards the [[tomb]] of the Oneto [[family]] in the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno|cemetery of Staglieno]] in [[Genoa]], [[Northern Italy]]. It is one of the most famous works by the [[neo-classicism|neo-classical]] Italian [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Giulio Monteverde]] (1837-1917) and was commissioned by Francesco Oneto, a president of the Banca Generale, in honour of deceased members of his family. Portraying a pensive angel with long, richly detailed wings, it is acknowledged as one of the most beautiful and sensual sculptures in its genre, to which Monteverde contributed other important neo-classical works.

[[File:The cover of "Composanto Di Genova.jpeg|thumb|250px|right]]
A picture of the work graces the cover of the publication, ''Camposanto Di Genova''.  The booklet calls the work, "a true masterpiece" and states, "The Angel, who guards the urn, is admired for the perfect moulding of the arms, neck and head, the deep and soft expression of grief which appears on her features; she holds a trumpet in her right hand, as if ready to sound it on the last judgement day."&lt;ref&gt; Camposanto Di Genova, Fratelli Lichino  Piazzale Clmitero Staglieno, Genova&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy''''' (1987) is a history of a notable slave mutiny of 1839 and its aftermath, written by professor Howard Jones.

The book explores the events surrounding the slave mutiny on the Spanish schooner ''[[La Amistad]]'' in 1839. The ship was taken into United States custody off the south coast of Long Island, New York. The book discusses the roles and international dynamics of the case, involving Spain, England, and the United States as they related to the 19th-century slave trade.  It examines [[United States v. The Amistad|'''''United States v. The Amistad Africans''''']] [[Case citation|40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 518]] (1841), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that adjudicated the property issues and ultimately the fate of the [[Mende people]] who were held captive on ''[[La Amistad|Amistad]]'' and the ownership of the vessel.

==Reception==
The book is by Howard Jones, a historian at the University of Alabama, and published in New York by Oxford University Press.

In his review published in ''Civil War History,'' Dudley T. Cornish noted that in 1965, the historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] described the ''Amistad'' case of 1839 as "the most famous involving slavery," until it was "eclipsed by the [[Dred Scott]] decision."&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/civil_war_history/v034/34.1.cornish.pdf Dudley T. Cornish, ''Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy'' (review)], ''Civil War History'', Volume 34, Number 1, March 1988, pp. 79-80, Project Muse 10.1353/cwh.1988.0011, accessed 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cornish wrote that Jones' work was "a careful, comprehensive study" that should make it easy to restore references to the case in textbooks, where it had been overlooked in the prior decade.&lt;ref name="cornish"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The 1997 film ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]'', directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], is based on this book, including the Supreme Court case. It stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Morgan Freeman]] as an American abolitionist, [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Joseph Cinqué|Cinqué]], leader of the slaves; and [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], the [[lawyer]] to the [[Mende people|Mende]] captives.

== Examples ==
One of the most common forms is dramatic action, which engages the reader into wondering what the consequences of the action will be.{{Example needed}}  This particular form has been recommended from the earliest days, stemming from [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]].{{Example needed}}

The use of action as the hook, and the advice to so use it, is so widespread as to sometimes lead to the use of the term to mean an action opening, but other things can be used for narrative hooks, such mysterious settings, or engaging characters, or even a thematic statement, as with [[Jane Austen]]'s opening line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." (''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')

When a story does not lend itself to a good hook when it is laid out linearly, the writer may tell the story out of order to engage the reader's interest.  The story may begin with a dramatic moment and, once the reader is curious, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the history necessary to understand it.  Or it may be told as a [[story-within-a-story]], with the narrator in the [[frame story]] telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand latter actions. A famous early example of this technique was used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', in which the frame story consists of [[Sheherazade]] telling stories to King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryar|Shahriyar]]; she must keep him 'hooked' to each of the stories, in order to prevent him from executing her the next morning.

=== ''In medias res'' ===
''[[In medias res]]'' is where the relating of a story begins at the midpoint, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=Tim|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of story telling might be used as a narrative hook. Narrative hooks often play an important role in [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thrillers]] and [[mystery fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Treat, America | year = 1982 | title = Mystery Writer's Handbook | publisher = Writer's Digest Books | page = 111 | isbn= 0898790808}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of both these occurrences is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which a tale, "[[The Three Apples]]," begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body, thus keeping the reader interested in "[[whodunit]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ File:Giorgione - Sleeping Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Giorgione's ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (c. 1510), Dresden, [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].]]
In [[art history]], "'''Old Master'''" (or "'''old master'''")&lt;ref&gt;The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/old_master Oxford Online Dictionaries], [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=old%20master American Heritage Dictionary], Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christies1&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/old-master-and-early-british-paintings-70-1.aspx Old Masters Department], Christies.com.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any [[painting|painter]] of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An "[[old master print]]" is an original [[printmaking|print]] (for example an [[engraving]] or [[etching]]) made by an artist in the same period. The term "old master [[drawing]]" is used in the same way.

In theory, "Old Master" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were [[Master craftsman|Master]]s of their local [[Guild of Saint Luke|artists' guild]], and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were "primitives", but this distinction is no longer made. The  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''  defines the term as "A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries." The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of [[John Evelyn]]: "My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"old master, n. and adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when ''oude meester'' mostly meant [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]] of the previous century. ''Les Maitres d'autrefois'' of 1876 by [[Eugene Fromentin]] may have helped to popularize the concept, although "vieux maitres" is also used in French. The famous collection in [[Dresden]] at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the [[Baroque]] period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, [[Goya]] (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master,&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; though he was still painting and [[printmaking]] at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for [[John Constable]]&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; (1776–1837) or [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1868), but usually is not.

The term tends to be avoided by [[art historian]]s as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms "Old Master Prints" and "Old Master drawings" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, "Old Master Paintings", "Nineteenth-century paintings" and "Modern paintings". [[Christie's]] defines the term as ranging "from the 14th to the early 19th century".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as ''[[Master E.S.]]'' (from his monogram), ''[[Master of Flémalle]]'' (from a previous location of a work), ''Master of [[Mary of Burgundy]]'' (from a patron), ''[[Master of Latin 757]]'' (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), ''[[Master of the Brunswick Diptych]]'' or ''[[Master of Schloss Lichtenstein]]''.

'''Peadar Kearney''' ({{lang-ga|Peadar Ó Cearnaígh}} {{IPA-ga|ˈpʲad̪ˠaɾˠ ɔ ˈcaɾˠnˠəi|pron}}; 12 December 1883 – 24 November 1942)&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.18, 231&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republican]] and composer of numerous [[Irish rebel music|rebel songs]]. In 1907 he wrote the lyrics to "[[Amhrán na bhFiann|The Soldier's Song]]" ("Amhrán na bhFiann"), now the Irish [[national anthem]]. He was the uncle of [[Irish literature|Irish writers]] [[Brendan Behan]], [[Brian Behan]], and [[Dominic Behan]].

==Background==
Kearney was born in 1883 at 68 [[Dorset Street, Dublin|Lower Dorset Street, Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.18&lt;/ref&gt; above one of the two [[grocer's]] shops owned by his father, John Kearney (1854–1897),&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.14, 17, 28&lt;/ref&gt; originally from Funshog, [[Collon]], [[County Louth]].&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.13&lt;/ref&gt; John's soon after lost his businesses and lived precariously as an insurance agent.&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.26&lt;/ref&gt;  Peadar's mother, Katie ''née'' McGuinness (1859/60–1907),&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.17,58&lt;/ref&gt; was from Rathmaiden, [[Slane]], [[County Meath]].&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Peadar was educated at the [[Model School(Dublin)|Model School]], Schoolhouse Lane and [[St Joseph's Christian Brothers School]] in [[Fairview, Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.18, 26&lt;/ref&gt; He heard Willie Rooney give nationalist lectures on history in the [[Mechanics' Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.24–25&lt;/ref&gt; He started at [[Belvedere College]] but played truant to escape beatings, so that his father ended his education and got him a job at a bicycle repair shop.&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.26–28&lt;/ref&gt; His father died of pneumonia soon after, leaving Peadar to support his mother and five younger siblings.&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.18, 28&lt;/ref&gt; He had various menial jobs for three years before being apprenticed to a house painter.&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.28–32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
In 1901, the death of Willie Rooney prompted Kearney to join the Willie Rooney Branch of the [[Gaelic League]].&lt;ref&gt;de Burca 1957 p.25&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] in 1903.&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centenary of Amhrán na bhFiann - The Soldier's Song |date=26 July 2007 |first=Mícheál |last=MacDonncha |url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/20014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104085322/http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/20014 |archivedate=4 Nov 2007 |work=[[An Phoblacht]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught night classes in Irish and numbered [[Seán O'Casey]] among his pupils.&lt;ref name="from-ireland.net"&gt;[http://www.from-ireland.net/history/origin.htm Origin of the Irish National Anthem] from-ireland.net&lt;/ref&gt; He found work with the National Theatre Society and in 1904 was one of the first to inspect the derelict building that became the [[Abbey Theatre]], which opened its doors on 27 December of that year. He assisted with props and performed occasional walk-on parts at the Abbey until 1916.&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt;

Kearney was a co-founder of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913. He took part in the [[Howth]] and [[Kilcoole]] gun runnings in 1914.&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt; In the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 Kearney fought at Jacob's biscuit factory under [[Thomas MacDonagh]], abandoning an Abbey Theatre tour in England to take part in the Rising.&lt;ref name="from-ireland.net"/&gt; He escaped before the garrison was taken into custody.&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt;

He was active in the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]]. On 25 November 1920 he was captured at his home in [[Summerhill, Dublin]] and was interned first in [[Collinstown Camp]] in Dublin and later in [[Ballykinler]] Camp in [[County Down]].&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt;

A personal friend of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], Kearney at first took the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] side in the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]] but lost faith in the Free State after Collins's death.&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt; He took no further part in politics, returning to his original trade of house painting.  Kearney died in relative poverty in [[Inchicore]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="pgil-eirdata.org"&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/k/Kearney_P/life.htm Peadar Kearney - Riscorso.net] Princess Grace Irish Library, Monaco&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] in Dublin. He was survived by his wife Eva and two sons, Pearse and Con.

==Songs and legacy==
Kearney's songs were highly popular with the Volunteers (which later became the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) in the 1913–22 period.  Most popular was "The Soldier's Song". Kearney penned the original English lyrics in 1907 and his friend and musical collaborator [[Patrick Heeney]] composed the music. The lyrics were published in 1912 and the music in 1916.&lt;ref name="from-ireland.net"/&gt; After 1916 it replaced "[[God Save Ireland]]" as the anthem of Irish nationalists. The [[Irish Free State]] was established in 1922 and formally adopted the anthem in 1926. Subsequently, theatres and the state broadcaster began playing the anthem at the end of performances, and Kearney prepared to take legal action to demand [[royalties]], obliging the state to acquire the [[copyright]] in 1934 for £980 (half each to Kearney and the heirs of Heeney, who had died).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Department of Finance|first=|title=Estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31st March, 1934, for the acquisition by the state of copyright in the national anthem |url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Library2/DL054933.pdf |format=PDF|series=Official publications|volume=P.1116|date=November 1933|publisher=Stationery Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sherry"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s, the anthem was increasingly sung in Irish, in a translation by [[Liam Ó Rinn]].

Other well-known songs by Kearney include "[[Down by the Glenside (The Bold Fenian Men)|Down by the Glenside]]", "[[The Tri-coloured Ribbon]]", "Down by the Liffey Side", "Knockcroghery" (about the village of [[Knockcroghery]]) and "Erin Go Bragh" ([[Erin Go Bragh]] was the text on the [[Irish nationalism|Irish national]] flag before the adoption of the [[Flag of Ireland|tricolour]]).

Kearney was the uncle of the writers [[Brendan Behan|Brendan]], and [[Dominic Behan]], both of whom were also republicans and songwriters, via his sister [[Kathleen Behan|Kathleen Kearney]] who married [[Stephen Behan]], one of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]'s "[[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|Twelve Apostles]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cottrell|first1=Peter|title=The War for Ireland: 1913-1923|date=2009|publisher=Osprey|isbn=1846039967|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFctAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brendan+behan+stephen+%22twelve+apostles%22&amp;dq=brendan+behan+stephen+%22twelve+apostles%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QokAVMG8FZHN7AbHoYHwAQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brendan Behan was in prison when Kearney died, and was refused permission to attend his funeral. In a letter to Kearney's son, Pearse, he said, "my Uncle Peadar was the one, outside my own parents, who excited the admiration and love that is friendship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Letters of Brendan Behan |editor=E.

'''Rapid visualization''' (also known as '''rapid vis''') is a technique used by [[graphic artist]]s to create a [[Concept art|drawing of a concept]] in several stages. After the completion of [[thumbnail|thumbnail drawing]]s, a preferred drawing is selected and rendered in full size, usually in [[pencil]]. Then a sheet of paper (layout bond) is put over the drawing and it is redrawn/traced with corrections, additions, and alterations. This process is repeated several times, often with color added at some stage, until the image is perfected to the desire of the artist.

The purpose of rapid vis is to take an idea from concept to accurate rendering without having to start over from scratch each time an edit or alteration is desired. The completed drawing is usually still considered a rough layout or comprehensive for approval submission (as opposed to [[work of art|finished art]] for framing or [[camera-ready]] art for reproduction).

'''Ruth Brown Snyder''' (March 27, 1895 – January 12, 1928) was an American [[murderer]]. Her [[death penalty|execution]] in the [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing Prison]] for the murder of her husband, Albert, was recorded in a well-publicized photograph.

==Crime==
In 1925, Snyder was a housewife from [[Queens Village, Queens]], [[New York City]] who began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married [[corset]] salesman. She then began to plan the murder of her husband, enlisting the help of her new lover, though he appeared to be very reluctant. Her distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late [[fiancée]], Jessie Guischard, on the wall of their first home, and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as "the finest woman I have ever met," had been dead for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:93NhH52erasJ:http://www.trivia-library.com/a/the-snyder-gray-murder-case-part-2.htm+Ruth+Brown+Snyder+was+born&amp;hl=en&amp;strip=1|title=Snyder/Gray case details|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Snyder first persuaded her husband to purchase insurance, and, with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for [[forgery]]) "signed" a $48,000 [[life insurance]] policy that paid extra ("[[double indemnity]]") if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Henry Judd Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill her husband, all of which he survived.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1928/01/13/page/2/article/ruths-brother-and-mother-object-to-prison-post-mortem|title=Story of the Crime|date=January 13, 1928|publisher=Chicago Tribune|page=2|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1927, the couple [[garrotte]]d Albert Snyder and stuffed his nose full of [[chloroform]]-soaked rags, then staged his death as part of a burglary.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Detectives at the scene noted that the burglar left little evidence of breaking into the house. Moreover, the behavior of Mrs. Snyder was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife witnessing her husband being killed.&lt;ref name=murder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1935/12/29/page/65/article/snyder-murder-husband-victim-of-wife-and-her-weakling-paramour|title=Snyder Murder|author=Murchie, Guy, Jr.|date=December 29, 1935|pages=9–10|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police then found the property that Ruth claimed had been stolen. It was still in the house, but hidden. A breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the letters "J.G." on it (it was a memento Albert Snyder had kept from former lover Jessie Guischard), and asked Ruth about it. A flustered Ruth's mind immediately turned to her lover, whose initials were also "J.G.," and she asked the detective what Gray had to do with this. It was the first time Gray had been mentioned, and the police were instantly suspicious. Gray was found upstate, in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. He claimed he had been there all night, but eventually it turned out a friend of his had created an alibi, setting up Gray's room at a hotel. Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was caught and returned to [[Jamaica, New York|Jamaica, Queens]] and charged along with Ruth Snyder.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story/&gt; [[Dorothy Parker]] told Oscar Levant, an American in Paris, that Gray tried to escape the police by taking a taxi from [[Long Island]] to Manhattan, New York, which Levant noted was "quite a long trip." According to Parker, in order "not to attract attention, he gave the driver a ten-cent tip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levant|first=Oscar|title=The Memoirs of an Amnesiac|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1965|location=New York|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trial===
Snyder was imprisoned at [[Sing Sing]] in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]], about 30 miles north of New York City. Her prison cell there would in the future also be used to hold Eva Coo and "Lonely Hearts killer" [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck|Martha Beck]].{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}

The trial at the [[Long Island City]] Courthouse was covered by such figures as [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]], [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]], [[Aimee Semple McPherson]], [[D. W. Griffith]], [[Damon Runyon]], [[Will Durant]], [[James M. Cain]] (crime reporter who wrote the novella that became the movie, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'') and, a year before her own death from [[cancer]], [[Nora Bayes]].{{citation needed|date = March 2018}} Runyon disparaged the crime's status as a clever attempt at a murder—he nicknamed it "the dumb-bell murder case" because "it was so dumb!"{{citequote|date = March 2018}}

Ruth Snyder and Gray turned on each other, contending the other was responsible for killing Albert Snyder; both were convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1927/05/05/page/1/article/women-faint-at-grays-horror-story|title=Women Faint at Gray's Horror Story|date=May 5, 1927|pages=2, 4|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
On January 12, 1928, Snyder became the first woman to be executed in Sing Sing since 1899. She went to the electric chair only moments before her former lover.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Her execution (by [[New York State Electrician]] [[Robert G. Elliott]]) was caught on film, by a photograph of her as the electricity was running through her body, with the aid of a miniature plate camera custom-strapped to the ankle of [[Tom Howard (photographer)|Tom Howard]], a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' photographer working in cooperation with the ''Tribune''-owned ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="siedu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=472|title=HistoryWired: A Few of Our Favorite Things|website=National Museum of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's camera was owned for a while by inventor [[Miller Reese Hutchison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owner of camera that took death cell pictures a recent visitor here|url=http://bplonline.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4017coll2&amp;CISOPTR=171&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=4|work=Clipping from [[The Birmingham News]]|publisher=[[Birmingham Public Library]]|date=February 9, 1938|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became part of the collections of the [[Smithsonian|Smithsonian's]] [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref name="siedu"/&gt;

Snyder was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in The [[The Bronx|Bronx]], New York City.  Her gravestone simply reads "Brown".&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lorraine Snyder==
Albert and Ruth had one child, a daughter named Lorraine, who was nine at the time of her father's murder. Following the pronouncement of the death sentence on her mother in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives of both Albert and Ruth Snyder regarding the care of Lorraine. Warren Schneider, &lt;!-- no explanation of why variation of brothers' surname spelling --&gt;brother of Albert Snyder, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a legal guardian who was not a member of Ruth Snyder's family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth Snyder, also petitioned for custody of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To Seek Guardian for Lorraine Snyder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kq0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fGkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=4608,3431254|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=May 12, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine had been in the care of Mrs. Brown since the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Snyder's Family|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=supPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3lQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown&amp;pg=2323,5380779|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Evening Independent|date=January 10, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother's execution. Ruth requested that her daughter not be brought to the prison for a final visit.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=To Rush Snyder Insurance Case|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HcsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ksEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2713,738843|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 13, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruth Snyder Brown Grave 1024.jpg|thumb|The grave of Ruth Brown Snyder in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]].]]On September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown was awarded guardianship of the girl.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Give Snyder Tot to Grandparent|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WzkbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LUoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=custody+lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=1006,2571474|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=September 7, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there were disputes with the insurance company Ruth Snyder had used to insure her husband's life. Although one policy, worth [[US$]]30,000, was paid out without contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dual Execution Makes Trio Ill|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HssaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ksEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown&amp;pg=1978,1172947|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 14, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; they filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000 (the three combined policies worth ${{Inflation|US|0.08|1927|r=2|fmt=c}} million today). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected as they had been issued fraudulently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal Ruling Against Child|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=328bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=80oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=6348,352384|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=November 11, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Snyder and Brown asked the court to allow them to appeal without a printed record, on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930 it was finally ruled on appeal that the two  policies were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snyder Insurance Policies Not Valid|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SB0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lWYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown+snyder&amp;pg=4876,7417631|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=June 21, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time on death row, Ruth Snyder wrote a sealed letter to be given to Lorraine "when she is old enough to understand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girls, Orphaned Years Ago By Chair, Happy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kOtXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=60QNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown+lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=6876,1263081|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Toledo News-Bee|date=January 12, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after her mother's execution, Lorraine was apparently aware that her parents were both dead, but not of the manner of either of their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''Murder Casebook'' {{ISBN|0-748-51462-7}} p. 2212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction in popular media==
* The drama ''[[Machinal]]'' (1928), by playwright Sophie Treadwell, is based on Snyder's trial.
* The movies ''[[Blessed Event]]'' (1932) and ''[[Picture Snatcher]]'' (1933) make references to Snyder's execution. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* A fictionalized version of the trial was the basis of scenes in ''[[State's Attorney (film)|State's Attorney]]'' (1932) with John Barrymore as the prosecutor.
* The case was the inspiration for the novel ''[[Double Indemnity (novel)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1943) by [[James M. Cain]],&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/robert_elliott/6.html?print=yes|title=truTV Official Website - TV Show Full Episodes and Funny Video Clips|website=www.trutv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later [[Double Indemnity (film)|adapted for the screen]] (1944) by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]].
* Cain also mentioned that his book ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1934) took inspiration from the crime &lt;ref name="The Art of Fiction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3474/the-art-of-fiction-no-69-james-m-cain|title=James M. Cain, The Art of Fiction No. 69|first=Interviewed by David|last=Zinsser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Near the end of the 1951 film ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', a reporter, Scotty, mentions that Snyder's execution was the first he ever covered. When another character asks Scotty if he was able to get a picture, Scotty answers, "No, they didn't allow cameras, but one guy . . . ." The approach of "The Thing" interrupts him, but Scotty is seemingly referring to Howard's photo of Snyder in the electric chair.
* In ''[[The Bad Seed]]'', [[William March]] based his depiction of Bessie Denker's execution upon that of Ruth Snyder.
* [[Guns N' Roses]]' 1991 ''[[Use Your Illusion]]'' albums feature, as part of their enclosed artwork, a photo of the band posing in front of an oversized reproduction of the ''Daily News''' headline/photograph announcing Ruth Snyder's execution.
* The novel ''A Wild Surge of Guilty Passion'' (2011), by [[Ron Hansen (novelist)|Ron Hansen]], is based on the murder case. &lt;!-- isbn neeeded --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The only organization who uses a unique officer structure for their chapters. Grand Artist is the equivalent of the President, Auxiliary Grand artist as Committee chair or as Vice President, Master Artist as Junior Adviser and Grand Master Artist as Adviser. It is also broadly consists of three main recognized level groups; 1) College Student level group, 2) Alumni/Municipal/Professional Level and 3) Mixed Probationary level group.

==History==
Established by a mere student organization in [[Central Luzon State University]] (CLSU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tutsea.com.ph/organisations/2823/samahang-makasining-inc|title=Samahang Makasining (Artist Club), Inc.|publisher=ltutsea|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as CLSU Artist Club which was founded on February 12, 1982. Starting by the [[Constancio Padilla National High School]] (CPNHS Young Artist Club) to be the first high school chapter founded on September 7, 1994. Then on September 5, 1995, the [[Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology]] (NEUST Artist Club) in Cabanatuan City became the first College/University chapter. Founded also in that same year were the [[Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College]] (ISPSC Artist Club) and [[Tarlac College of Agriculture]] (TCA Artist Club). 

In 1998 the Samahang Makasining (Artist Club) was officially registered at the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) as a non-profit organization. The group has been also recognized and affiliated to the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA) on the same year (1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://112.199.66.15/cultural_%20mapping/cultural_mapping.php?i=5|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)|title=Cultural mapping|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the SEC registration, the [[Pantabangan]] Municipal Chapter was founded and established on November 20, 1999, being the first Municipal/Professional level of the group. 

The organization has extended and opened the horizon to all interested artists. The [[Philippine Rice Research Institute|Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice)]] Chapter became the first national agency professional level members founded on November 7, 2003. On November 29, 2008, that was 11 years passed, the University of Southern Mindanao (USM Artist Club) was founded and became the first University chapter in Mindanao area. There are now 42 chapters nationwide as of 2014.

=== The members ===
The members often use brother or sister for their members. The others called the members as '''Makasining''' (Filipoino term for pro-artist) or sometimes the members within the club use the word '''Kasining''' (Filipino term co-artist).

== Ritual and symbolism ==
The [[candle]] is a symbolic object for the group. It is a symbol of new born artist for the organization, while the candle [[light]] symbolizes the artist's life, knowledge and education. The Makasining describes itself as an "Art educator of the Universe, one of the great messengers".

'''Scriptorium''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-scriptorium.ogg|s|k|r|ɪ|p|ˈ|t|ɔːr|i|ə|m}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|scriptorium|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European [[monasteries]] devoted to the writing, copying and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] of manuscripts by monastic [[scribe]]s.

== The functional outset ==
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|This late 15th-century miniature of [[Jean Miélot]] (died 1472)&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 
depicts the author at work: perhaps his ''Miracles de Nostre Dame'', in which this miniature appears.]]

When monastic institutions arose in the early 6th century (the first European monastic writing dates from 517), they defined European literary culture and selectively preserved the literary history of the West. Monks copied Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible and the commentaries and letters of early Church Fathers for missionary purposes as well as for use within the monastery.

In the copying process, there was typically a division of labor between the monks who readied the parchment for copying by smoothing and chalking the surface, those who ruled the parchment and copied the text, and those who illuminated the text. Sometimes a single monk would engage in all of these stages to prepare a manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Shailor, ''The Medieval Book'', (Toronto: U Toronto Press, 1991), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators of manuscripts]] worked in collaboration with scribes in intricate varieties of interaction that preclude any simple understanding of monastic manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Aliza Muslin-Cohen, ''A Medieval Scriptorium: St. maria Magdalena de Frankenthal'' series Wolfenbüttler Mittelalter Studien (Wiesbaden) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the monasteries provided a valuable medium of exchange.
Comparisons of characteristic regional, periodic as well as contextual styles of [[handwriting]] do reveal social and cultural connections among them, as new hands developed and were disseminated by travelling individuals, respectively what these individuals represented, and by the examples of manuscripts that passed from one cloister to another. 
Recent studies follow the approach, that ''scriptoria'' developed in relative isolation, to the extent that the [[Paleography|paleographer]] is sometimes able to identify the product of each writing centre and to date it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;
McKitterick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 13th century secular workshops developed,&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 
where professional scribes stood at writing-desks to work the orders of customers, and during the [[Late Middle Ages]] the praxis of writing was becoming not only confined to being generally a monastic or regal activity. However, the practical consequences of private workshops, and as well the invention of the [[printing press]] vis-a-vis monastic ''scriptoria'' is a complex theme.&lt;ref&gt;
for example, cf. De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The physical scriptorium==

Much as medieval libraries do not correspond to the exalted sketches from [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Name of the Rose,”&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/library-or-labyrinth/ "Library or labyrinth" Irene O’Daly. January 11, 2013 (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
it seems that ancient written accounts, as well as surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations do not invariably attest to the evidence of scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/pondering-the-physical-scriptorium/ "Pondering the physical scriptorium" Jenneka Janzen. January 25, 2013 by medievalfragments (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scriptoria in the physical sense of a room set aside for the purpose perhaps mostly existed in response to specific scribal projects; for example, when a monastic (and) or regal institution wished a large number of texts copied.

References in modern scholarly writings to 'scriptoria' typically refer to the collective written output of a monastery, 
somewhat like the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] in the early regal times is taken to refer to a specific fashion of modelling formulars, 
but especially traditional is the view that scriptoria was a necessary adjunct to a library, as per the entry in du Cange, 1678 'scriptorium'.&lt;ref&gt;
Du Cange, et al., ''Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis'', Niort: L. Favre, 1883–1887 (10 vol.).

&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Giovanni Evangelista, Rimini===
At this church whose patron was [[Galla Placidia]] (died 450), paired rectangular chambers flanking the apse, accessible only from each aisle, have been interpreted as paired (Latin and Greek) libraries and perhaps scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Charlotte Smith, "The Side Chambers of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna: Church Libraries of the Fifth Century" ''Gesta,'' '''29'''.1 (1990): 86–97)&lt;/ref&gt; The well-lit niches .5 meter deep, provisions for [[hypocaust]]s beneath the floors to keep the spaces dry, have prototypes in the architecture of Roman libraries.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mackowiecka, ''The Origin and the Evolution of the Architectural Forms of the Roman Library'' (Warsaw) 1978, noted by Smith 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassiodorus and the Vivarium===
The monastery built in the second quarter of the 6th century under the supervision of [[Cassiodorus]] at the Vivarium near [[Squillace]] in southern Italy contained a scriptorium, for the purpose of collecting, copying, and preserving texts.

Cassiodorus' description of his monastery contained a purpose-built scriptorium, with self-feeding{{clarify|date=February 2016}} oil lamps, a [[sundial]], and a [[water-clock]]. The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, as well as the necessary ink wells, penknives, and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, at the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|end of the Roman Empire]], he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts. In the end, however, the library at the Vivarium was dispersed and lost, though it was still active around 630.&lt;ref name=JNormanVivarium&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Jeremy|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium (Circa 560)|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=204|website=HistoryofInformation.com|publisher=Jeremy Norman &amp; Co., Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
The scriptoria of the [[Cistercian]] order seem to have been similar to those of the Benedictines. The mother house at [[Cîteaux]], one of the best-documented high-medieval scriptoria, developed a severe "house style" in the first half of the 12th century. 
The 12th-century scriptorium of [[Cîteaux]] and its products, in the context of Cistercian scriptoria, have been studied by Yolanta Załuska, ''L'enluminure et le scriptorium de Cîteaux au XIIe siècle'' (Brecht:Cîteaux) 1989.

== Institutions ==
In [[Byzantium]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] learning maintained importance and numerous monastic 'scriptoria' were known for producing Bible/Gospel illuminations, along with workshops that copied numerous classical and Hellenistic works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that one such monastic community was that of [[Mount Athos]], which maintained a variety of illuminated manuscripts and ultimately accumulated over 10,000 books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Benedictines===
Cassiodorus' contemporary, [[Benedict of Nursia]], allowed his monks to read the great works of the pagans in the monastery he founded at [[Monte Cassino]] in 529. The creation of a library here initiated the tradition of Benedictine scriptoria, where the copying of texts not only provided materials needed in the routines of the community and served as work for hands and minds otherwise idle, but also produced a marketable end-product. Saint [[Jerome]] stated that the products of the scriptorium could be a source of revenue for the monastic community, but Benedict cautioned, "If there be skilled workmen in the monastery, let them work at their art in all humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 57, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch57 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Benedictine monasteries, the writing room was actually a corridor open to the central quadrangle of the [[cloister]].&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/03script.html#location OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The space could accommodate about twelve monks, who were protected from the elements only by the wall behind them and the vaulting above. Monasteries built later in the Middle Ages placed the scriptorium inside, near the heat of the kitchen or next to the [[calefactory]]. The warmth of the later scriptoria served as an incentive for unwilling monks to work on the transcription of texts (since the charter house was rarely heated).

====St. Gall====
The Benedictine [[Plan of St. Gall]] is a sketch of an idealised monastery dating from 819–826, which shows the scriptorium and library attached to the northeast corner of the main body of the church; this is not reflected by the evidence of surviving monasteries. Although the purpose of the plan is unknown, it clearly shows the desirability of scriptoria within a wider body of monastic structures at the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Murray, ''After Rome's Fall,'' (Toronto: University Toronto Press, 1998), pp. 262, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
There is evidence that in the late 13th century, the Cistercians would allow certain monks to perform their writing in a small cell "which could not... contain more than one person".&lt;ref&gt;George Haven Putnam, ''Books and their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), 405.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were called scriptoria because of the copying done there, even though their primary function was not as a writing room.

===Carthusians===
The [[Carthusian]]s viewed copying religious texts as their missionary work to the greater [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]; the strict solitude of the Carthusian order necessitated that the manual labor of the monks be practiced within their individual cells, thus many monks engaged in the transcription of texts. In fact, each cell was equipped as a copy room, with parchment, quill, inkwell, and ruler. Guigues du Pin, or Guigo, the architect of the order, cautioned, "Let the brethren take care the books they receive from the cupboard do not get soiled with smoke or dirt; books are as it were the everlasting food of our souls; we wish them to be most carefully kept and most zealously made."&lt;ref&gt;C.H.Lawrence, ''Medieval Monasticism'', Ed.2 (London &amp; New York: Longman, 1989) 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Orthodox church===

====The Resava====

After the establishment of [[Manasija]] Monastery by [[Stefan Lazarević]] in the early 15th century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox [[Balkans]]. One of the most famous scholars of the so-called School of Resava was Constantine the Philosopher /Konstantin Filozof/, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school (Stefan Lazarević).

====Rača====
During the Turkish invasions of the Serbian lands (which lasted from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 19th centuries) the monastery was an important centre of culture. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced by monk-scribes, mostly Serbian liturgical books and Old Serbian ''Vita.'' [[hagiographies]] of kings and archbishops.

Numerous scribes of the Serbian Orthodox Church books—at the term of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th centuries—who worked in the [[Rača monastery]] are named in Serbian literature – "The Račans". . Among the monk-scribes the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor Račanin, [[Kiprijan Račanin]], [[Jerotej Račanin]], [[Teodor Račanin]] and [[Gavril Stefanović Venclović]]. These are well-known Serbian monks and writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval ([[Late Middle Ages]]) and [[Baroque]] periods in art, architecture and literature in particular.

==Monastic rules==
[[File:Meister des Codex Amiatus 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ezra]] in the [[Codex Amiatinus]], believed to be based on a portrait of [[Cassiodorus]] in his library. [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]], before 716]]

===Cassiodorus' ''Institutes''===
Although it is not a monastic rule as such, [[Cassiodorus]] did write his ''[[Institutes]]'' as a teaching guide for the monks at Vivarium, the monastery he founded on his family's land in southern Italy. A classically educated Roman convert, Cassiodorus wrote extensively on scribal practices. He cautions over-zealous scribes to check their copies against ancient, trustworthy [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplars]] and to take care not to change the inspired words of scripture because of grammatical or stylistic concerns. He declared "every work of the Lord written by the scribe is a wound inflicted on Satan", for "by reading the Divine Scripture he wholesomely instructs his own mind and by copying the precepts of the Lord he spreads them far and wide".&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, Institutes, I, xxx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Cassiodorus did include the classical texts of ancient Rome and Greece in the monastic library. This was probably because of his upbringing, but was, nonetheless, unusual for a monastery of the time. When his monks copied these texts, Cassiodorus encouraged them to amend texts for both grammar and style.&lt;ref&gt;James O. O'Donnell, ''Cassiodorus,'' University of Californian Press, 1979. Postprint online (1995), [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html Upenn.edu], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Benedict===
The more famous monastic treatise of the 7th century, Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]], fails to mention the labor of transcription by name, though his institution, the monastery of [[Montecassino]], developed one of the most influential scriptoria, at its acme in the 11th century, which made the abbey "the greatest center of book production in South Italy in the High Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1999:3; the scriptorium is fully examined in Francis Newton, ''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058–1105'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Here was developed and perfected the characteristic "Cassinese" [[Beneventan script]] under [[Desiderius of Montecassino|Abbot Desiderius]].

The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] does explicitly call for monks to have ready access to books during two hours of compulsory daily reading and during [[Lent]], when each monk is to read a book in its entirety.&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 48, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch48 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus each monastery was to have its own extensive collection of books, to be housed either in [[armarium]] (book chests) or a more traditional library. However, because the only way to obtain a large quantity of books in the [[Middle Ages]] was to copy them, in practice this meant that the monastery had to have a way to transcribe texts in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Haven Putnam, ''Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative translation of Benedict's strict guidelines for the oratory as a place for silent, reverent prayer actually hints at the existence of a scriptorium. In Chapter 52 of his Rule, Benedict's warns: "Let the oratory be what it is called, and let nothing else be done or stored there".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 52, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch52 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''condatur'' translates both as ''stored'' and ''to compose or write,'' thus leaving the question of Benedict's intentions for manuscript production ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/07script.html#rules OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commentaries on the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] describe the labor of transcription as the common occupation of the community, so it is also possible that Benedict failed to mention the scriptorium by name because of the integral role it played within the monastery.

====Saint Ferréol====
Monastic life in the [[Middle Ages]] was strictly centered around [[Liturgy of the Hours|prayer]] and manual labor. In the early Middle Ages, there were many attempts to set out an organization and routine for monastic life. [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Montalembert]] cites one such sixth-century document, the Rule of [[Ferréol of Uzès|Saint Ferréol]], as prescribing that "He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; As this implies, the labor required of a [[scribe]] was comparable to the exertion of agriculture and other outdoor work. Another of Montalembert's examples is of a scribal note along these lines: "He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour, but although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
An undated Cistercian ordinance, ranging in date from 1119–52 (Załuska 1989) prescribed ''literae unius coloris et non depictae'' ("letters of one color and not ornamented"), that spread with varying degrees of literalness in parallel with the Cistercian order itself, through the priories of Burgundy and beyond.

In 1134, the Cistercian order declared that the monks were to keep silent in the scriptorium as they should in the [[cloister]].

==Books and transcription in monastic life==

Manuscript-writing was a laborious process in an ill-lit environment that could damage one's health. One prior complained in the tenth century:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''Only try to do it yourself and you will learn how arduous is the writer's task. It dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits your chest and belly together. It is a terrible ordeal for the whole body''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Greer, Germaine. ''The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work''. Tauris Parke, 2001. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The director of a monastic scriptorium would be the ''armarius'' ("provisioner"), who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process. However, the armarius had other duties as well. At the beginning of Lent, the armarius was responsible for making sure that all of the monks received books to read,&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"/&gt; but he also had the ability to deny access to a particular book. By the 10th century the armarius had specific liturgical duties as well, including singing the eighth [[responsory]], holding the lantern aloft when the abbot read, and approving all material to be read aloud in church, chapter, and [[refectory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fassler, Margot E., "The Office of the Cantor in Early Western Monastic Rules and Customaries," in ''Early Music History'', 5 (1985), pp. 35, 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Vivarium c. 540–548, '''Cassiodorus''' wrote a commentary on the Psalms entitled ''Expositio Psalmorum'' as an introduction to the Psalms for individuals seeking to enter the monastic community. The work had a broad appeal outside of Cassiodorus' monastery as the subject of monastic study and reflection.

Abbot '''[[Johannes Trithemius]]''' of Sponheim wrote a letter, ''De Laude Scriptorum'' (In Praise of Scribes), to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz in 1492 to describe for monks the merits of copying texts. Trithemius contends that the copying of texts is central to the model of monastic education, arguing that transcription enables the monk to more deeply contemplate and come to a more full understanding of the text. He then continues to praise scribes by saying "The dedicated scribe, the object of our treatise, will never fail to praise God, give pleasure to angels, strengthen the just, convert sinners, commend the humble, confirm the good, confound the proud and rebuke the stubborn".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons he gives for continuing to copy manuscripts by hand, are the historical precedent of the ancient scribes and the supremacy of transcription to all other manual labor. This description of monastic writing is especially important because it was written after the first printing presses came into popular use. Trithemius addresses the competing technology when he writes, "The printed book is made of paper and, like paper, will quickly disappear. But the scribe working with parchment ensures lasting remembrance for himself and for his text".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"/&gt; Trithemius also believes that there are works that are not being printed but are worth being copied.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his comparison of modern and medieval scholarship, '''James J. O'Donnell''' describes monastic study in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''[E]ach Psalm would have to be recited at least once a week all through the period of study. In turn, each Psalm studied separately would have to be read slowly and prayerfully, then gone through with the text in one hand (or preferably committed to memory) and the commentary in the other; the process of study would have to continue until virtually everything in the commentary has been absorbed by the student and mnemonically keyed to the individual verses of scripture, so that when the verses are recited again the whole phalanx of Cassiodorian erudition springs up in support of the content of the sacred text''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James O. |last=O'Donnell |title=Cassiodorus |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979 |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap5.html |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, the monks of the Middle Ages came to intimately know and experience the texts that they copied. The act of transcription became an act of meditation and prayer, not a simple replication of letters.

'''''Sinfonia da Requiem''''', Op. 20, for orchestra is a [[symphony]] written by [[Benjamin Britten]] in 1940 at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;Britten, Benjamin; Mitchell, Donald, ed.; Reed, Philip, ed.

The Japanese government rejected the Sinfonia for its use of Latin titles from the Catholic [[Requiem]] for its three movements and for its somber overall character, but it was received positively at its world premiere in New York under [[John Barbirolli]]. A performance in Boston under [[Serge Koussevitzky]] led to the commission of the opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' from the [[Koussevitzky Music Foundations]].

The Sinfonia is Britten's largest purely orchestral work for the concert hall. It was his first major orchestral work that did not include a soloist and, according to musicologist Peter Evans, marks the peak of his early writing in this idiom. Unlike many of Britten's works from this time, it has remained popular and continues to be programmed on orchestral concerts.

==History==
In the early autumn of 1939, [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] was commissioned through the British Consul to write a work for a special festivity by an unspecified great power. Britten agreed in principle to this request, provided that he could dictate the subject and medium used and that he would not be expected to furnish a piece that was in any way [[jingoistic]].{{sfn|Britten|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|White|1970|p=32}} Britten eventually learned that the requester was Japan, whose government had requested works by composers from several countries to celebrate the 2600th anniversary of the ruling dynasty.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stevenson"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/composition/sinfonia-da-requiem-for-orchestra-op-20-mc0002364703 | title = Benjamin Britten, Sinfonia da Requiem, for orchestra, Op. 20 | author = Joseph Stevenson | year = 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com | accessdate = 26 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Japan was engaged fully in its invasion of mainland China but had not yet entered [[World War II]] formally or become allied with Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy. It had also developed a firm acquaintance with Western classical music. Performing groups trained by Western musicians were numerous.&lt;ref name="freed"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2769 | title = Sinfonia da Requiem, Op. 20 | author = Richard Freed | year = 2003 | publisher = The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts | accessdate = 25 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Western composers who received commissions included [[Richard Strauss]], who was directed to participate by [[Joseph Goebbels]] of the Nazi German government, and French composer [[Jacques Ibert]].{{sfn|Sharer|2003|pp=217–18}} Along with the Western composers invited, several Japanese composers participated in the anniversary celebrations.&lt;ref name="freed"/&gt;

Six months passed before the contract to write this work arrived. By this time, Britten had begun work on the Sinfonia. The delay in receiving the contract left him with only six weeks in which to fulfil the commission.{{sfn|Brittten|2003|p=19}} The only work which Britten felt able to complete in time was the Sinfonia. In ''Britten on Music'', the composer wrote that he then approached the local Japanese consul, discussed the work's nature and its suitability for the occasion for which it was intended, and told the consul of the Latin titles for the work's three movements. Britten assumed that all the information he disclosed had been forwarded to the Japanese ambassador. He wrote that he was subsequently notified that the Sinfonia would fulfill the commission satisfactorily. Britten completed the work, submitted it, and for six months heard nothing more about the matter.{{sfn|Britten|2003|p=19}}

In the autumn of 1940, Britten was summoned to the Japanese consulate, where he was read a long letter from Viscount [[Hidemaro Konoye]], who served as organizer of the celebration. The Viscount was the younger brother of Prince [[Fumimaro Konoye]], the then prime minister of Japan. In this letter, the Viscount accused Britten, as Britten later wrote, "of insulting a friendly power, of providing a Christian work where Christianity was apparently unacceptable, that the work was gloomy, and so on".{{sfn|Britten|p=19}} This section of the letter read, "We are afraid that the composer must have greatly misunderstood our desire&amp;nbsp;... [The music] has a melancholy tone both in its melodic pattern and rhythm, making it unsuitable for performance on such an occasion as our national ceremony." &lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/sinfonia-da-requiem-benjamin-britten | title = About the Piece: Sinfonia da Requiem, Benjamin Britten | author = Herbert Glass | year = 2012 | publisher = Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra | accessdate = 26 Aug 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017175446/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/sinfonia-da-requiem-benjamin-britten | archivedate = 2013-10-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of poet and fellow expatriate [[W.H. Auden]], Britten replied in writing, "in as dignified a manner as possible", that his supplying a Christian work was no surprise, as he was a Christian and came from a Christian nation. He denied the alleged glumness of the Sinfonia and any intent of an insult, and said that the delay in receiving the contract had eliminated the possibility of composing a celebratory work within the deadline.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt; Britten submitted this letter to the British consulate, which approved it and forwarded it to Tokyo. This was the last, he wrote, that he heard of the matter. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], relations between Britain and Japan were severed.{{sfn|Britten|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|White|1970|p=33}} Although the piece was rejected, the Japanese did not request the return of the commissioning fee. Instead, Viscount Konoye announced that Britten's score had arrived too late for inclusion in the celebration.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;

==Premiere and subsequent commission==
The world premiere took place in [[Carnegie Hall]], New York on 29 March 1941 with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under [[John Barbirolli]].&lt;ref&gt;Britten; Mitchell; Reed; ''op. cit.'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The first British performance took place the following year,&lt;ref&gt;Britten; Mitchell; Reed; ''op. cit.'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; and its belated Japanese premiere was on 18 February 1956, with the composer conducting the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Pears, Peter; Reed, Philip, ed.; Thorpe, Marion, contributing. (1999) {{Google books|x1v-xi4mi9QC|The Travel Diaries of Peter Pears, 1936–1978: 1936–1978}}. Boydell &amp; Brewer. page 64. {{ISBN|0-85115-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after the New York premiere, [[Serge Koussevitzky]] conducted the work with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. This performance led to the [[Koussevitzky Music Foundations]] commission of Britten's opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]''.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;

==Composition==
===Structure===
The symphony is in three movements played without a break, and a performance usually lasts around 20 minutes. Britten's analysis, quoted in the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]]'s program notes, reads:

{{Quote|I. [[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrymosa]]. A slow marching lament in a persistent 6/8 rhythm with a strong tonal center on D. There are three main motives: 1) a syncopated, sequential theme announced by the cellos and answered by a solo bassoon; 2) a broad theme, based on the interval of a major seventh; 3) alternating chords on flute and trombones, outlined by piano, harps and trombones. The first section of the movement is quietly pulsating; the second is a long crescendo leading to a climax based on the first cello theme. There is no pause before:

II. [[Dies irae]]. A form of [[Dance Macabre|Dance of Death]], with occasional moments of quiet marching rhythm. The dominating motif of this movement is announced at the start by the flutes and includes an important tremolando figure. Other motives are a triplet repeated-note figure in the trumpets, a slow, smooth tune on the saxophone, and a livelier syncopated one in the brass. The scheme of the movement is a series of climaxes of which the last is the most powerful, causing the music to disintegrate and to lead directly to:

III. Requiem aeternam. Very quietly, over a background of solo strings and harps, the flutes announce the quiet D-major tune, the principal motive of the movement. There is a middle section in which the strings play a flowing melody. This grows to a short climax, but the opening tune is soon resumed, and the work ends quietly in a long sustained clarinet note.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt;}}

The headings of the three movements are taken from the Roman Catholic [[Mass for the dead]], but the composition has no liturgical associations. Britten described the movements respectively as "a slow, marching lament", "a form of Dance of Death" and "the final resolution". All its movements have D as their tonal center.

===Anti-war tone===
According to Herbert Glass, Britten composed the ''Sinfonia da Requiem'' as a memorial to his parents. It was also an expression of the composer's lifelong [[pacifism]] and a reaction to the darkening political developments that led eventually to the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He had, in fact, recently settled in the [[United States]] because of Britain's involvement in the war.&lt;ref name="glass"/&gt; In an article published on 27 April 1940, he told the ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'', "I'm making it just as anti-war as possible&amp;nbsp;... I don't believe you can express social or political or economic theories in music, but by coupling new music with well-known musical phrases, I think it's possible to get over certain ideas&amp;nbsp;... all I'm sure of is my own anti-war conviction as I write it."{{sfn|Cooke|1996|pp=13–14}}

Britten's politically themed works before 1939 had not proved popular. While his publisher, [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]], had supported him in his composition, it had also tried to encourage him to write more conventional pieces, suggesting, for example, a piano concerto for the BBC and a ballet for Sadler's Wells. The war changed all this. Before the Sinfonia, the ''Ballad of Heroes'' and ''Advance Democracy'' did well because of their political themes.{{sfn|Kildea|2002|pp=39–40}}

===Place in Britten's canon===
Musicologist Peter Evans claims that, while ''[[Diversions for Piano Left Hand and Orchestra]]'' came afterwards, the Sinfonia represents the peak of Britten's early orchestral writing.{{sfn|Evans|1979|pp=57–58}}

'''Sumgayit State Musical Drama Theater''' is a professional theater operating in [[Sumgayit]]. It is named after [[Huseyn Arablinski]].

==History==

The Sumgayit State Drama Theater, named after the [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] theater figure and director Huseyn Arablinski, was created in September 1968. In 1969, the Azerbaijani government made a decision to perpetuate the memory of [[Huseyn Arablinski]] by naming the theater after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.az/down/he_serencamlar.pdf Decision 1969 about perpetuating the memory of Huseyn Arablinski] www.anl.az&lt;/ref&gt; This was enacted as a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR and by the order of the Ministry of Culture.

The theater opened its curtain on March 14, 1969 with [[Mirza Fatali Akhundzadeh]]'s "Monsieur Jordan, the Botanist, and Dervish Mastali-shah", directed by Jannat Salimova. On the following day, the British poet [[John Patrick (poet)|John Patrick]]'s work was performed, produced by Nasir Sadigzade. 
In 1974 the theater was given the status of "Sumgayit State Drama Theater" by the decision of the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name=OfficialSite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sumqayitdram.az/teatrin-tarixi/ |title=Sumqayıt Dövlət Dram Teatrı |website=sumqayitdram.az |language=az |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094302/http://sumqayitdram.az/teatrin-tarixi/ |archivedate=April 29, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suzanne Jackson''' (American, born 1944) is a visual artist with a luminous career spanning five decades with work exhibited in museums and galleries around the world. Since the late 1960s, Jackson dedicated her life to studio art with additional participation in the theatre, teaching, arts administration, community life, and social activism. Jackson’s oeuvre includes poetry, dance, theater and costume design, paintings (both two- and three-dimensional), prints, and drawings. Jackson has spent a time throughout her career teaching students and influencing future generations of artists and culture creators, as well as building and participating in close-knit art communities with peer artists and thinkers: San Francisco State (College) University and Bay Area artists and teachers including Charles White; Los Angeles during the 1960s-80s including [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Gallery 32|Gallery 32]] which she founded, its artistic circle, as well as her representation by Ankrum Gallery; life in Idyllwild, CA in the 1980s teaching and creating art; Yale University; the theatre communities in California, New Haven, CT, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, PA in the 1990s; and the Savannah, GA art community since 1996.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Jackson was born in [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, MO]] and her family moved to [[San Francisco|San Francisco, CA]] when she was nine months old. Jackson lived in San Francisco until she was eight years old, Jackson was then raised in the city of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] from 1952-61 (both during its time as a Territory and early Statehood), graduating from [[Monroe Catholic High School|Monroe High School]] in 1961—the only Catholic high school in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fairbanks]] and the northernmost Roman Catholic high school in the Americas .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a teenager in Alaska, she became a member of the [[National Audubon Society]] which has influenced some of the content of her work from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South of Pico: African American Artists in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s|last=Jones|first=Kellie|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Durham, NC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the first African American to attend the [[4-H|National 4-H]] [http://national4-hcongress.com/ Congress] in  Chicago in 1960 which helped her receive scholarships and allowed her to attend college.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=2383743|title=Interview with Suzanne Jackson|last=Mason, Karen Anne (interviewer)|first=Suzanne Jackson (interviewee)|date=UCLA Library Digital Collections, Oral History Collections, African American Artists of Los Angeles|website=|archive-url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=2383743|archive-date=1998|dead-url=|access-date=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the "World Peace, Humane Society, and Kindness to Animals" scholarship from The International Latham Foundation, the [[Banff Centre|Banff School of Fine Arts]] Scholarship, the [[Standard Oil]] Scholarship, and National Home Study Art Course.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Art Education ===
Jackson moved to the Bay Area in 1961 to attend [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State (College) University]], where she studied both art and ballet, eventually receiving a BA in painting in 1966. She later completed an MFA from the [[Yale School of Drama|School of Drama]], [[Yale University]], in 1990, specializing in theater design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1960s-1970s ===

At the age of 17, Jackson moved from Alaska to the Bay Area to attend college. She remained on the West Coast through the 1960s and ‘70s, mostly moving between Los Angeles and San Francisco. She opened [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Gallery 32|Gallery 32]] in Los Angeles which operated from 1968-70 (see [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Gallery 32|Gallery 32]]). Jackson’s artwork was represented by the Ankrum Gallery from 1968 until 1989 and held solo exhibitions there in 1972, 1974, 1976, and 1978.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/ankrum-gallery-records-6569/historical-note Ankrum Gallery] was run by [https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=joan-wheeler-ankrum&amp;pid=170437 Joan Ankrum], a respected and renowned actress turned gallerist, along with [[William Challee|William (Bill) Chalee]] from 1960-89. Jackson produced artists books of poetry and painting, "What I Love" (1972) and "Animals" (1978). (see [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Poetry|Poetry]])&lt;blockquote&gt;“When [[Bernie Casey|Bernie [Casey]]] brought to the gallery several of Suzanne’s paintings, I was immediately struck with the freshness and originality of her work. It is most unusual to find so young an artist with a valid philosophical statement (and to communicate it successfully). Her feelings about her blackness are expressed in somewhat symbolic terms, and her world of fantasy, love and hope is revealed to the viewer in a very refreshing style… She very well may be the first Black woman in America to make a truly important contribution to art.”      -- Joan Ankrum (1/5/1974)
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sova.si.edu//record/AAA.ankrgall|title=Suzanne Jackson folder|last=Ankrum|first=Joan|date=|website=Smithsonian Archives|archive-url=https://sova.si.edu//record/AAA.ankrgall|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1980s-1990s ===
In 1981, Jackson was first introduced to Savannah, GA through an invitation to be a visiting artist with [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] through the recommendation of [[Bernie Casey]]. Additionally, in 1981, Jackson’s work was included in the exhibition “Forever Free: African American Women” which traveled to the [[Gibbes Museum of Art]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, SC]]. Jackson lived in [[Idyllwild, CA]] from 1981–85 and was on faculty as a Visiting Artist at the [[Idyllwild Arts Academy|Idyllwild School of Music and Arts]] (1981–82), and Chair of the Fine and Performing Arts at the Elliott-Pope Preparatory School (formerly Desert Sun School) (1982–85).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1987, Jackson relocated to [[New Haven, CT]] to attend [[Yale University]], pursuing a master’s degree under the tutelage of [[Ming Cho Lee]] for scenography. She worked as a freelance scenic and costume designer moving throughout the region until taking a post at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] as a scenographer and Assistant Professor from 1994-96. In 1996, Jackson moved full-time to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah, GA]] to teach at [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] as Professor of Painting, where she taught full-time until 2009.

=== 2000s-Today ===
Jackson officially retired from [[Savannah College of Art and Design|SCAD]] in 2009, but Jackson remained as a part-time and adjunct professor until 2013. Additionally, Jackson taught introductory art history courses, including African American Art History at [[Savannah State University]] in 2013-2014 school year. Jackson has remained an active member of the Savannah artistic community and continues to create and exhibit her work. Jackson co-hosts a weekly radio show featuring jazz and conversation, called ''Listen Hear'' on WHCJ 90.3 [[Savannah State University]] Radio, alongside Ike Carter, Jerome Meadows, Tom Van de Ven, Lisa Jackson and Carla Curran, PhD.

==Artistic Practice==
Suzanne Jackson has had an extensive career an emphasized the importance of living the lifestyle of an artist, in her words, to be an artist is to solve problems as opposed to create images. She states, “I'm not an artist yet. I'm a painter. And I draw, and I work in theater as an "artist person," in quotes. But to become an artist takes a whole lifetime.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout her career, Jackson has looked to nature for inspiration, she has consistently related blackness to nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her work has celebrated blackness through the representation of black bodies without an overtly political message.

=== Visual Arts ===
Jackson has worked in a variety of visual media including works on paper, works on canvas, and Monoprints. Her works on paper include both watercolors and drawings from throughout her career. Jackson has worked mostly with acrylic paint, her earliest paintings on canvas were with acrylic paint layered, the way one would layer oils paints. She stated, “the imagery that everybody has sort of become familiar with, with the really strong white background and the sort of washy layers and layers of paint—that basically is kind of an old masters technique of layering the color for translucency. It's like the layers and layers of color build a depth in the painting. And some of the paintings, as thin as the color looks, there could be a hundred and fifty layers of color on each of my paintings.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 1990s marked a shift in her work as she began to experiment with different combinations of media.  As her style progressed, Jackson began to forego the canvas in favor of netting as a substrate. She uses [https://www.novacolorpaint.com/ Novacolor's]acrylic gels to create 3-dimensional hanging works held together by fabric, papers, found objects, leaves, and or various netting. (For images of Jackson's work, please visit her website http://www.suzannefjackson.net/) 

=== Theater and Costume Design ===
Jackson graduated from Yale in 1990 and traveled the Northeast region (Connecticut, New York, and Philadelphia) as well as parts of California (Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area) working as a freelance Scenic and Costume Designer. Her costume designs were included in the exhibition [http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9503/stage.html Onstage: A Century of African American Stage Design], at the Library for the Performing Arts, [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], New York.

From 1982-85, Jackson was the Chair of the Fine Arts Department of the Elliot‑Pope Preparatory School, [[Idyllwild-Pine Cove, California|Idyllwild, CA]] where she choreographed performances including ''[[Oliver!|Oliver]]!'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', and the ''Cosmic Festival''.

Several of her Artist Statements are written in verse: &lt;blockquote&gt;MY ART DEALS WITH REALITY

VERSUS FANTASY--- ALONENESS

VERSUS LONLINESS… WHAT I

PAINT ATTEMPTS TO EXPRESS THE

CONFLICTS WITHIN THE MIND,

CONFLICTS OF CHOICES--- OF LOVES,

---OF SENSITIVITIES SEARCHING,

ORDERING, “FREEING” ONESELF

TOWARD SOME CONTINUOUS

CYCLE OF REDISCOVERING WHO,

IN FACT, I MIGHT REALLY BE.

--Statement from Suzanne Jackson’s book, ''What I Love'' (1970)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Gallery 32 ==
Many associate Jackson’s name with Gallery 32, an art gallery she ran in Los Angeles, a space dedicated to fostering a supportive artist community. Gallery 32 (1968-1970) was inspired by artist [[Charles White (artist)|Charles White]]’s philosophy that art could be an effective vehicle for community activism and social change. Seeking to replicate Jackson's previous experiences of San Francisco bohemianism, Gallery 32 functioned less as a business than as a place for the exchange of ideas and philosophies. Jackson funded the gallery herself, largely with money she earned from teaching. The gallery became an important venue, hosting discussions, poetry readings, and fund-raisers for social causes, and exhibiting work that demonstrated strong political and civic engagement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/now-dig-this/artists/suzanne-jackson/|title=Suzanne Jackson|last=Keith|first=Naima J.|date=08/06/18|website=Hammer Museum|archive-url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/now-dig-this/artists/suzanne-jackson/|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She aimed to make art from black artists with black themes accessible for all members of the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It quickly became one of the few art spaces in Los Angeles to exhibit emerging African American artists such as Gloria Bohanon, [[Emory Douglas]], [[David Hammons]], [[Betye Saar]], and Timothy Washington. The gallery also hosted fund-raising exhibitions for the [[Black Arts Council]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Watts Towers]] Arts Center children's arts program. One of the gallery's important exhibitions was the 1970 Sapphire Show, the first Los Angeles survey of African American women artists. Gallery 32 played a vital role in the progressive struggles of the period while contributing to the diverse art scene of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The remaining artworks and ephemera have been promised to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institute]] per the artist’s request.

'''Swedish art''' refers to the visual arts produced in [[Sweden]] or by Swedish artists.  Sweden has existed as country for over 1,000 years, and for times before this, as well as many subsequent periods, Swedish art is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Swedish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Sweden has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Swedish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Sweden has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation greatly disrupted Swedish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requiremnents of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the late 17th or 18th centuries that large numbers of Swedes were trained in contemporary styles.  The political success of the [[Vasa dynasty]] led to a considerable revival, expressed in the "Gustavan style", which again had some influence over neighbouring countries.    

Among famous Swedish artists are [[Johan Tobias Sergel]], [[Carl Milles]], [[Anders Zorn]], [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Carl Eldh]]. 
==History==
=== Prehistoric art ===
[[File:Aspberget rock carving Sweden 4.jpg|thumb|Pre-historic petroglyphs in [[Tanum Municipality|Tanum]]]]
When the ice age ended, the Scandinavian peninsula was populated from the south by hunters and gatherers. Art surviving from that period are [[Stone Age]] expressions and is simple and reflects the available material. Only the truly persistent art forms have survived the ravages of time: [[petroglyph]]s, are such an expression. The earliest rock carvings in the form of symbols, characters and images are carved in rock outcrops and boulders. They began to be produced about 7000 BC. Sweden has one of the largest concentrations of petroglyphs with a local center in [[Tanum Municipality]] in [[Bohuslän]] province.
  
During the [[Bronze Age]], a spiral ornamentation was produced in the style that existed in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"&gt;{{cite web |author=Östby, Leif &amp; Frode Ernst Haverkamp |year=2009 |url=http://www.snl.no/Sverige/kunst |title=Sverige - kunst |publisher= Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 400 AD, the development of the Nordic animal ornamentation, an unusually rich and imaginative style that reached its peak during the 7th century with the so-called Vendel style. Animal ornamentation experienced a renewed flourishing of the [[rune stones]]. Rune stones - some of which are quite illustrative and are therefore called “image blocks” - were added between about  200 AD and 1130 with a flourishing between the period 980-1100. As an art form, the rune stone is specific to the Nordic culture. Sweden leads the way with the highest amount of rune stones with a total of 2,800 inscriptions. Approximately 85% of all the identified blocks have been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm nordiska.uu.se]&lt;/ref&gt; The stones were originally painted and combined text with ornamentation and stylized characters. They can be divided into seven different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gräslund, Anne-Sofie (2006). ''Dating the Swedish Viking-Age rune stones on stylistic grounds'', Runes and their secrets: studies in runology. {{ISBN|978-87-635-0627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first known image-makers in Sweden were, in fact, rune carvers.

Sweden, especially the south of the country, also participated in [[Viking Age art]], along with the rest of Scandinavia.

=== Medieval and Gothic art ===
[[File:Harkeberga 0844.jpg|thumb|left|This painting by [[Albertus Pictor]] can be seen in [[Härkeberga Church]] (c. 1480).]]
With the advent of Christianity came a new iconography, originally established in the churches, particularly in the form of altar screens, crucifixes, and stones. According to the [[Swedish History Museum]], no other country has such a rich and comprehensive collection of medieval liturgical art.&lt;ref name=hmus&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historiska.se/historia/medeltiden/livochsamhalle/kyrkanlivetscentrum/|title= Kyrkan - livets centrum - Historiska|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 31 January 2007|website= www.historiska.se|publisher= [[Swedish History Museum]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity was shown in [[Romanesque art]] products fabrics and gold works. From the 13th century, Gotland was a center for sculptors, such as the anonymous [[Master Majestatis]]. The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style came to Sweden during the second half of the 13th century. [[Linköping]] Cathedral is mostly conducted in English Gothic style and contains richly decorated sculptures. Several works from this period exhibit a French influence, for example the [[triumphal cross]] from [[Öja Church]], Gotland and St. Erik's statue in [[Roslags-Bro Church]] in Uppland. There are also Gothic monumental paintings on wood in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Visual narratives gained momentum in the churches in central Sweden in the late 15th century by masters such as [[Nils Håkansson]], Master Petrus. Håkansson's student, [[Albertus Pictor|Albert the painter]], however, was to become far more famous for his religious paintings in Uppland. Motives during this period were often religious or mythical. Albert the painter, motivated by a chess playing Grim Reaper in [[Täby Church]], was the inspiration for [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' almost 600 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Contemporary with Albertus the Painter is the famous sculpture of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] in the [[Storkyrkan|Great Church]] of Stockholm.&lt;ref name=Hillman&gt;Hillman, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by the German-born painter and sculptor [[Bernt Notke]], one of the late Middle Ages the most important northern European artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/kort/berntnotke Nationalencyklopedin: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt; Notke, who periodically lived in Sweden, was very productive and had great influence with an intense and expressionistic style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/420621/Bernt-Notke Encyklopedia Britannica: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance and Baroque art ===
[[File:Vädersolstavlan.jpg|thumb|17th century copy of [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]]'s ''Vädersoltavlan'', the oldest known image of Stockholm. The painting can be seen in Storkyrkan.]]
The Vasa period of art consisted largely of portraits of princes, which were painted by foreign artists who were active in Sweden. [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]] with his ''Vädersoltavla'' from 1535, in the Great Church in Stockholm, was an exception. He is one of the few well-known Swedish artists during the Vasa period and the Renaissance era.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

[[File:Georg Stiernhielm, 1598-1672.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]] painted this portrait of [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (1663)]]
[[File:Gustav III of Sweden 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Roslin]]'s magnificent portrait of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1777)]]

The pompous, happy and decorative made its entrance in the 17th century Great Power - during the 17th and 18th centuries the first few decades - was a grand time for architecture. A number of castles, mansions and churches built, like the Royal Palace, meant that artists were called from abroad. These foreign artists trained new generations of Swedish artists. More significant art collections were acquired through spoils of war. One famous artist was the court painter [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Ehrenstral was also a portraitist and animal painter, and worked with the [[Drottningholm Palace]], together with Johan Sylvius.  [[Erik Dahlbergh]] depicted the superpower era of Sweden in the great work ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]''. Other painters were [[David von Krafft]], [[Michael Dahl]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

===Rococo and the Gustavian style===
Liberty and the Gustavian period was a major cultural boom in Sweden. At this time, [[Rococo]] was the initial style.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Future portrait paintings made it internationally known in Swedish painting.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt; During the period, many Swedish artists moved to continental Europe. A representative of the rococo was [[Gustaf Lundberg]]. His technique was long dominant in the Swedish portrait arts, and he is represented at the Louvre and the National Museum and Art Academy. The French painter [[Guillaume Taraval]] was called upon to decorate the Royal Palace. Together with [[Carl Hårleman]] he advocated the new relaxed style. A leading style artist was [[Jean Eric Rehn]], a student of Hårleman, who worked as craftsmen, architect and artist.

[[Alexander Roslin]] took inspiration from France and conducted many highly sensitive portraits of the era's finest personalities. Some of Roslin's portraits are among the most reproduced from the period. Of major importance was also [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]], who became a court painter in Denmark. Pilo was inspired both by Venetian artists and the Dutchman [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Pilo returned, however, to Sweden and then painted the great work Gustaf III's coronation in Stockholm Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Other prominent names were [[Johan Pasch]], [[Per Krafft the Elder]], [[Peter Adolf Hall]] and, perhaps most importantly, [[Johan Tobias Sergel]]. Over time, beginning around 1770, Rococo was succeeded in Sweden by the Gustavian period. Swedish neoclassicism is said to have begun around 1785. The Gustavian period was characterized by both French and English influence. 
  
After Gustav III's death, there was a period of stagnation in Swedish art. On the other hand, peasant painting flourished in particular, Dalarna and Hälsingland with painting and [[Dala horse]]s during this time.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Peasantry painting became a major inspiration for the 18th century artist [[Carl Larsson]].  [[Gothicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were the styles of art for several decades, including artists like the sculptor [[Bengt Fogelberg]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Fogelberg, who was inspired by the Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], created powerful statues of Nordic gudagestalter and historical figures.

=== Karl Johan style ===
From the mid-19th century and a few decades later, nature paintings dominated the scene, with Marcus Larsson in the lead. Artists that pointed to something new were Egron Lundgren and Carl Fredrik Hill. Hill became one of the foremost Swedish landscape-painters as he had views that reflected his personality and often express despair and darkness. Egron Lundberg developed watercolor art,  as he traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, and painted his findings. Even history painting was done extensively during the period, including artists such as Carl Gustav Hellquist Gustaf and Cederstrom.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Another painter was August Malmström who created historic and romantic nature works and illustrated many fairytales.

=== Romanticism and naturalism ===

From an international perspective Swedish-produced art languished in obscurity until the late 19th century, when a number of Swedish artists gained attention outside of Sweden. Especially the 1880s and the following two decades were periods of greatness in the Swedish art. Perhaps the best artist of them is the painter, sculptor, and printmaker [[Anders Zorn]]. Zorn was an extremely talented oil painter with a very precise but free style.[[File:Midsommardans av Anders Zorn 1897.jpg|thumb|180px|left| [[Anders Zorn]]'s ''Midsummer Dance'', 1897]] Anders Zorn painted landscapes and people and is known for his nude studies of the hillocks from [[Dalarna]].{{huh|date=February 2016}} Zorn was also concerned with depicting peasant life in his home province of Dalarna. Woman artist [[Amalia Lindegren]] also created glorified scenes of the Swedish peasant and folk. Zorn was counted as one of the foremost painters in Europe in the late 19th century and made many portraits of contemporary celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4aug/art0822.html#zorn Safran-Arts.com:Anders Leonard Zorn]&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous work is ''Love's Nymph'' (1883), ''A Prime'' (1888), ''Midsummer Dance'' (1897), ''President Grover Cleveland'' (1899) and ''Bathing hills'' (1906). Zorn's art is featured at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the [[White House]], and his works are among the most valued of all Swedish artists.

Another big name from this generation is [[Carl Larsson]]. Larsson, like Zorn, appeared in Dalarna and is one of the most beloved Swedish artists. Larsson painted primarily in watercolor and his motives were found in daily life: he often portrayed his own family and their home in Sundborn. His style is airy, very light and is characterized by a skillful interplay of surfaces and lines. Larsson created frescoes and wall paintings, like Midvinterblot and several other frescoes in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Larsson became very famous in Germany in connection with an art book, A Home, that was published there. Another painter who achieved great popular popularity was [[Bruno Liljefors]] with very precise paintings of nature and animals in motion. 
[[File:Bergh Richard Nordic Summer Evening.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Richard Bergh]]'s ''Nordic Summer Evening'', 1899-1900]]
Two painters with great stylistic ability were [[Eugène Jansson]] and [[Ernst Josephson]]. Jansson's paintings, which took stylistic inspiration from [[van Gogh]], are often simple geometric forms a large, quiet Stockholm Ground and powerful male figures. Josephsson is more varied and known for masterful oil portraits. He became an inspiration for the later modernism. Portrait painting was also developed by Richard Bergh as well as by [[Nils Kreuger]]. A significant development came in 1885 with the artist's group The Opponents, who wanted to renew the Swedish painting and collected many of those names. A few years later, in the 1890s, Bergh and Kreuger founded the Dorset School together with [[Karl Nordström]]. They reacted against the realistic landscape style and were inspired by Paul Gauguin. Especially Nordström was inspired by the French impressionists. A close friend of Nordström was the author and the universal genius of [[August Strindberg]]. Even Strindberg was an important Swedish painter from the period. The rise of women artists, such as [[Eva Bonnier]], and [[Hanna Hirsch-Pauli|Hanna Pauli]], who, among other things, took inspiration from Rembrandt, also becomes prominent in this period.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

=== Modernism and expressionism ===

Modernism began to enter Swedish art with [[Axel Törneman]] and then the Men of 1909, which was a group of young male artists, mainly from the Artist League school. More abstract forms were represented by [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Nils von Dardel]] and [[Gösta Adrian Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

The mid-1920s and a couple of decades following were both characterized by surrealism, the [[Halmstad Group]], and of expressionism, which includes Gothenburg Schools realists, Sven Erixson and Bror Hjorth and a rigorous formalist, abstract minimalism of artists such as [[Olle Bærtling]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Among the sculptors of the period are Carl Eldh and [[Carl Milles]]. Both have had great influence and the latter is perhaps the most famous Swedish sculptor of all time. From the same generation of sculptors came the self-taught wood sculptor and realist people portrayer [[Axel Petersson Döderhultarn]].

After World War II,  Swedish art was something of a boom and a host of artists established themselves. With a new democratic idea that art was founded for everyone in 1947, popular movements promoting art and in the same period also launched a variety of arts organizations across the country. Among the 1930s radicals as painter [[Albin Amelin]] and graphic artist and monumental painter [[Torsten Billman]] the work continued to bring images to the working people. Torsten Billman could also through his literary illustrations reach new groups. In the 1950s expressionists emerged like Torsten Renqvist and more informal painter Rune Jansson and Eddie Figge.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

In the early 1960s, was revitalized by the Swedish graphic artists as Philip von Schantz and Nils G. Stenqvist.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

A '''technical director''' ('''TD''') is usually a senior technical person within e.g. a [[software]] company, [[engineering]] firm, [[film]] studio, [[Theatre|theatrical]] company or [[television studio]].  This person usually possesses the highest level of [[skill]] within a specific technical field.

== Software ==
In [[software development]], a technical director is typically responsible for the successful creation and delivery of the company's product to the marketplace by managing technical risks and opportunities; making key [[software design]] and implementation decisions with the development teams, scheduling of tasks including tracking dependencies, managing [[change request]]s, and guaranteeing quality of deliveries and educating the team on technical [[best practice]]s.

Typical responsibilities:
* Defines the technological strategy in conjunction with the development team of each project: pipeline, tools, and key development procedures
* Assesses technical risk and mitigation plan
* Establishes standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression
* Evaluates development teams, identifying strengths, problem areas, and developing plans for improving performance
* Evaluates interview candidates for technical positions
* Scouts for and evaluates new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and development excellence
* Oversees technical design documentation process for correctness and timeliness
* Provides input to the other disciplines on the practicality of initial design goals and impact to the overall project timeline
* Evaluates software implementation on design and task thoroughness
* Helps to identify high risk areas for the project director
* Identifies weak software systems that need code improvement and schedules corrective action, when possible
* Creates automated test process for system features, where possible, and contributes to the build system
* Aids in all stages of post-production including during finalizing

== Film and games ==
In visual effects (VFX) ([[Industrial Light and Magic]], [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]), feature animation ([[Pixar]], [[Dreamworks Animation]]) and game development ([[Naughty Dog]]), a technical director's responsibilities vary from studio to studio and as such, the term is not very well defined.

Typically, a TD is a combination of an artist and a programmer, responsible for the more technical aspects of film production, such as programming [[shader]]s, developing [[Skeletal animation|character rigs]] and animation setups, performing complex simulation tasks and setting up the pipeline (how the data is passed from one stage in the film production to the next). In contrast to a programmer, a TD would normally not work on large programming projects, but rather make heavy use of [[scripting language]]s such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Maya Embedded Language|MEL]], [[MAXScript]], or [[shell script]]ing.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Another responsibility of a TD is to look after any technical problems the regular artists encounter and to develop custom tools to improve the artists' workflow.

In these industries, "technical artist", "technical animator" and "generalist TD" are sometimes used as synonyms.

===Categorization of technical directors in film and games===
Frequently, the role of a TD is more precisely defined. Various areas of computer graphics require a high degree of specialized technical/scientific knowledge and therefore merit more precise categorization. As an example, a skilled Character TD has a strong understanding of human/animal anatomy, movement, and mechanics, whereas a skilled Lighting TD might have a detailed understanding of the physical properties of light and surfaces.

Those categories include (but are not limited to) the following.
* Effects TD
* Lighting TD
* Modeling TD 
* Pipeline TD
* Layout TD
* [[Character TD|Creature TD or Character TD]]
* Hair TD 
* Cloth TD 
* Matchmove TD

=== Education ===
Technical directors usually have a background in computer science, though such education often lacks expertise in practical film and media production. [[Film Academy Baden-Württemberg|Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]] offers a unique, 30-month postgraduate course for technical directing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://td.animationsinstitut.de Technical Directing]&lt;/ref&gt; The course is open to applicants worldwide (English language skills required). Aside from working on film, animation, vfx and game projects, the students also engage in research.

== Theatre ==
It is a technical director's job to make sure the technical equipment in the theater is functional, maintained and safe. The technical director, along with the production manager, is responsible for the overall organization of the technical production process. Duties included are generating necessary working drawings for construction (in conjunction with a draftsperson, if there is one); budget estimations and maintaining of accounts; materials research and purchasing; scheduling and supervising build crews; coordinating load-ins; handling conflicts that arise between different departments; and organizing the strike and clean-up for the production. Often times the Technical Director can serve as the head of the scenic department, supervising the master carpenter, carpenters, charge artists and leading them in the realiziation of the scenic designer's vision. 

"Technical director" can also refer to the in-house chief designer or master carpenter for a smaller theater company.

In venues that host touring productions, the TD may also be responsible for advancing the technical rider, hiring local crew, renting equipment and liaisoning between the tour manager and the local crew.

== Television ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cut (film)]] --&gt;
The technical director works in a [[production control room]] of a [[television studio]] and operates the [[Vision mixer|video switcher]] and associated devices as well as serving as the chief of the [[television crew]].  For a [[remote broadcast]] outside of the [[television studio|studio]], the TD will perform the same duties in a mobile [[production truck]]. It is the TD's job to ensure all positions are manned and all equipment and facilities are checked out and ready before the recording session or live broadcast begins. They typically will switch video sources, perform live digital effects and transitions, and insert pre-recorded material, graphics and titles as instructed by the [[Television director|director]]. In larger productions, the director does not actually operate the production equipment, allowing him/her to coordinate the production and make rapid decisions without worrying about how to mechanically execute the effect or camera move being called for. The technical director may provide training to more inexperienced members of the technical crew when needed. In consultation with the director, the TD may have more or less input into the creative side of the production, depending on the situation.  He/she may provide the director with guidance on crew assignments, camera shots and the most efficient way to accomplish any given effect. The TD is usually responsible for the technical quality of the signal being recorded or broadcast and will use various measuring devices and displays to ensure quality control.

Technical directors commonly work on productions that are either broadcast live or recorded on [[video tape]] or [[video server]]s. Television productions shot on film generally do not use TDs, as the camera cuts and effects are realized in [[post production]] after the shooting is completed.

The terminology in the [[UK]] differs in some respects from the above description: The production control room is called a "gallery", a mobile production truck is called an "[[Outside broadcasting|OB van]]" or a "scanner" (a [[BBC]] term).  In UK television practice, the technical director is the senior technical person in the gallery and supervises the technical team, but does not operate the "[[vision mixer]]".  The TD is responsible for ensuring that the gallery is technically fit for purpose, the routing of internal and external sources, as well as liaison with other technical areas such as [[master control]] rooms and transmission suites. They may additionally perform vision control duties, matching the exposure and colour balance of the cameras ("racking").

The area is bounded by the Liffey to the north, Dame Street to the south, [[Westmoreland Street]] to the east and [[Fishamble Street]] to the west. It is promoted as Dublin's 'cultural quarter' and, as a centre of Dublin's city centre's [[nightlife]], is a [[tourist destination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.visitdublin.com/dublin-vibrant-city-quarters | publisher = National Tourism Development Authority (Fáilte Ireland) | website = visitdublin.com | title = Dublin Quarters - Visit Dublin | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple Bar is in the [[Dublin postal districts|postcode]] Dublin 2 (D2).

==History==
In medieval (Anglo-Norman) times, the name of the district was St. Andrews Parish.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite web|author = Sean Murphy | title = A Short History of Dublin's Temple Bar | publisher = Centre for Irish Genealogical and Historical Studies | place = Bray, County Wicklow | url = http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/dublin/templebar.htm | date = | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a suburb, located outside the city walls. But the area fell into disuse beginning in the 14th century because it was exposed to attacks by the native Irish.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

The land was redeveloped again in the 17th century, to create gardens for the houses of wealthy English families. At that time the shoreline of the [[River Liffey]] ran further inland of where it lies today, along the line formed by Essex Street, Temple Bar and Fleet Street. Marshy land to the river side of this line was progressively walled in and reclaimed, allowing houses to be built upon what had been the shoreline; but unusually, the reclaimed land was not quayed, so that the back yards of the houses ran down to the water's edge. (Not until 1812 were these back yards replaced by Wellington Quay.) The fronts of the houses then constituted a new street. The first mention of Temple Bar as the name of this street is in [[Bernard de Gomme]]'s Map of Dublin from 1673, which shows the reclaimed land and new buildings. Other street names given nearby are Dammas Street (now Dame Street) and Dirty Lane (now Temple Lane South).&lt;ref name = "Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirty Lane was originally called "Hoggen Lane" (i.e. hogs' lane); in the late 1680s it acquired the name "Dirty Lane", and this was then changed to "Temple Lane" in the early 1700s. At that time it was mostly occupied by warehouses and stables, along with the Shakespeare Tavern, "a much frequented establishment". (John T. Gilbert, ''A History of the City of Dublin'', 1859, vol. 2, p. 316.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merchants Arch Temple Bar.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance from Merchant's Arch]]
It is generally thought that the street known as Temple Bar got its name from the Temple family, whose progenitor [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]] built a house and gardens there in the early 1600s.&lt;ref name="curtis"&gt;{{cite book | title = Temple Bar: A History | author = Maurice Curtis | publisher = History Press Ireland | date = 2016 | isbn = 9781845888961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple had moved to Ireland in 1599 with the [[Essex in Ireland|expeditionary force of the Earl of Essex]], for whom he served as secretary. (He had previously been secretary of [[Sir Philip Sydney]] until the latter was killed in battle.) After Essex was beheaded for treason in 1601, Temple "retired into private life", but he was then solicited to become provost of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], serving from 1609 until his death in 1627 at age 72. William Temple's son [[John Temple (judge)|John]] became the "Master of the Rolls in Ireland" and was the author of a famous pamphlet excoriating the native Irish population for an uprising in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dublininquirer.com/2016/08/10/for-one-local-historian-a-rediscovery-of-temple-bar | publisher = Dublin Inquirer | website = dublininquirer.com | title = For One Local Historian, a Rediscovery of Temple Bar | date = 10 August 2016 | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; John's son [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] became a famous English statesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John T. Gilbert | title = A History of the City of Dublin | year = 1859 | volume = 2| pages = 315-316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this grand lineage, however, the name of Temple Bar street seems to have been more directly borrowed from the storied [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar district in London]], where the main toll-gate into London was located dating back to medieval times. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;London's Temple Bar is adjoined by Essex Street to the west and Fleet Street to the east, and streets of the same names occupy similar positions in relation to Dublin's Temple Bar. It seems almost certain therefore that Dublin's Temple Bar was named firstly in imitation of the historic Temple precinct in London. However, a secondary and equally plausible reason for using the name Temple Bar in Dublin would be a reference to one of the area's most prominent families, in a sort of pun or play on words. Or as it has been put more succinctly, Temple Bar 'does honour to London and the landlord in nicely-gauged proportions'.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, op. cit., quoting National Library of Ireland, '’Historic Dublin Maps'’, Dublin 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fishamble Street near Temple Bar was the location of the first performance of [[Georg Friedrich Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' on 13 April 1742. An annual performance of the ''Messiah'' is held on the same date at the same location. A republican revolutionary group, the [[Society of the United Irishmen]], was formed at a meeting in a tavern in Eustace Street in 1791.

In the 18th century Temple Bar was the centre of prostitution in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.estudiosirlandeses.org/reviews/striapacha-tri-chead-bliain-duailcis-prostitutes-three-hundred-years-of-vice/ | title = Striapacha Tri Chead Bliain Duailcis (Prostitutes: Three Hundred Years of Vice) | author = Niamh O’Reilly | work = J Irish Studies| publisher = Estudios Irlandeses }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the area slowly declined in popularity, and in the 20th century, it suffered from [[urban decay]], with many derelict buildings.

In the 1980s, the state-owned transport company [[Córas Iompair Éireann]] (C.I.É.) proposed to buy up and demolish property in the area and build a bus terminus in its place. While that was in the planning stages, the purchased buildings were let out at low rents, which attracted small shops, artists and galleries to the area. Protests by [[An Taisce]], residents and traders led to the cancellation of the bus station project, and then [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] was responsible for securing funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/charles-haughey-482309.html | title = Obituary - Charles Haughey | publisher = The Independent | website = independent.co.uk | date = 14 June 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100401045204/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/charles-haughey-482309.html | archivedate = 1 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1991, the [[Government of Ireland|government]] set up a not-for-profit company called ''Temple Bar Properties'' to oversee the regeneration of the area as Dublin's cultural quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title = Temple Bar Framework Plan | publisher = Dublin Corporation | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.templebar.ie | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031204122614/http://www.templebar.ie/index.asp | archivedate = 4 December 2003 | title = Temple Bar - Home Page | publisher = TempleBar.ie | quote = ''Temple Bar Properties is the company established in 1991 to revitalise the area as a Cultural Quarter'' | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, "stag parties" and "hen nights" were supposedly banned (or discouraged) from Temple Bar, mainly due to drunken loutish behaviour, although this seems to have lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990103/ai_n9704845 | title = Bar Stag Ban Sends Revellers To London| publisher = Sunday Mirror | date = 4 January 1999 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081014030037/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990103/ai_n9704845 | archivedate = 14 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, noise and anti-social behaviour remain a problem at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2008/0910/1220919675018.html | title = Nightmare in a city that never sleeps | publisher = Irish Times | website = irishtimes.com | date = 9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is the location of a number of cultural institutions, including the Irish Photography Centre (incorporating the Dublin Institute of Photography, the [[National Photographic Archive]] and the Gallery of Photography), the Ark Children's Cultural Centre, the [[Irish Film Institute]], incorporating the [[Irish Film Archive]], the Button Factory, the Arthouse Multimedia Centre, [[Temple Bar Gallery and Studio]]s, the [[Project Arts Centre]], the [[Gaiety School of Acting]], [[IBAT College Dublin]], the [[New Theatre, Dublin|New Theatre]], as well as the [[Irish Stock Exchange]].

After dark, the area is a centre for nightlife, with various tourist-focused nightclubs, restaurants and bars. Pubs in the area include The Temple Bar Pub, [[Porterhouse Brewery|The Porterhouse]], the Oliver St. John Gogarty, the Turk's Head, Czech Inn, the Quays Bar, the Foggy Dew, The Auld Dubliner and Bad Bobs.

The area has two renovated squares&amp;nbsp;– ''Meetinghouse Square'' and the central ''Temple Bar Square''. The Temple Bar Book Market is held on Saturdays and Sundays in Temple Bar Square. Meetinghouse Square, which takes its name from the nearby [[Quaker]] Meeting House, is used for outdoor film-screenings in the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.meetinghousesquare.ie/about/the_story/index.html | publisher = Temple Bar Cultural Trust | website = meetinghousesquare.ie | title = The Story of Meeting House Square | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since summer 2004, Meetinghouse Square is also home to the 'Speaker's Square' project (an area of [[public speaking]]) and to the 'Temple Bar Food Market' on Saturdays.

The 'Cow's Lane Market' is a fashion and design market which takes place on Cow's Lane on Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/to-market-to-market-1.391808 | publisher = Irish Times | website = irishtimes.com | title = To market, to market ... | date = 13 November 2003 | accessdate = 1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the 13th century [[Holy Trinity, Dublin: Augustinian Friars|Augustinian Friary of the Holy Trinity]] is visible within an apartment/restaurant complex called 'The Friary'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Casey |first=Christine  |year=2005 |title=Dublin: The City Within the Grand and Royal Canals and the Circular Road with the Phoenix Park |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQzYxvX_U8MC&amp;pg=PA440 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=440 |isbn=0300109237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trolleybuses of Roma Condesa''' are permanently parked [[trolleybus]]es in the [[Colonia Roma|Roma]] and [[Condesa]] neighborhoods of [[Mexico City]] used for art and other projects. The buses were donated to [[Mexico]] by the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] in 2000, with the idea of creating educational centers, but they sat abandoned until 2005, when the ''“Galería Trolebús”'' (Trolleybus Gallery) was begun to promote non-traditional art projects.  The gallery ceased operations in 2009 due to financial problems, but the buses are still used for art projects.

==Origin==
The three trolleybuses were part of a group of fourteen that were donated to Mexico by the government of Japan in 2000.&lt;ref name="sonoro"&gt;{{cite news |title= Artista sonoro "dialoga" con la Galería del Trolebús |newspaper=[[Notimex]] |location=Mexico City |date=February 11, 2009 |page= |language=Spanish| url=http://metrolatinousa.pointsoftouch.com/2009/02/11/artista-sonoro-dialoga-con-la-galeria-del-trolebus/|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trolleybuses were built between 1964 and 1968 by [[Mitsubishi]] as Models 100 and 200 for the [[Kansai Electric Power Company|Kansai Denryoku company]]. The two models are distinguished by the number of doors: one and two, respectively.&lt;ref name="haru"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nava Polina |first= Joel |date=March 2012 |title= Haru ga kita en México. La primavera está llegando al trolebús "Doble Vida"  |magazine= Tabi Tabi |volume=3 |issue=80 |pages=56–57 |location=Mexico City |publisher=Toyo Marketing, SA de CV |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The buses were shipped by cargo boat with the idea of turning them into educational centers, but this never happened. They sat abandoned in various parts of Mexico City, especially in the [[Cuauhtémoc, D.F.|Cuauhtémoc borough]].&lt;ref name="sonoro"/&gt; There are three that remain in use now for art projects, one permanently parked in [[Colonia Hipódromo]] by [[Parque España (Ciudad de México)|Parque España]], one in [[Colonia Roma]] next to Plaza Luis Cabrera and one next to [[Parque México]] in [[Colonia Condesa]].&lt;ref name="haru"/&gt; The trolleybus now by Parque España used to travel through a tunnel between [[Ōgizawa Station|Ogizawa]] and [[Kurobe Dam Station|Kurobe Dam]] in the [[Toyama Prefecture]] as written on the bus sign on the windshield.&lt;ref name="haru"/&gt; That line still operates and is known as the [[Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus]].

The vehicles were donated in 2000. Initially they sat abandoned until the ''Galería Trolebús'' project.&lt;ref name="sonoro"/&gt;

==''Galería Trolebús''==
From 2000 and 2005, the three buses sat abandoned until Ariadna Ramonetti discovered them and worked to create the ''Galería Trolebús'' (Trolleybus Gallery) in cooperation with the Cuauhtémoc borough to promote non-traditional art projects.&lt;ref name="sonoro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revisan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Revisan la creación desde las banquetas |author= Sonia Ávila |url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=negro-nota&amp;seccion=seccion-comunidad&amp;cat=10&amp;id_nota=830095 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |location=Mexico City |date=April 28, 2012 |language=Spanish |accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who worked with the vehicles from 2005–09 included Karen Cordero, Ana Elena Mallet, Santiago Espinoza de los Monteros and Antonio Calera.&lt;ref name="revisan"/&gt; Some of the art projects included light and sound.&lt;ref name="sonoro"/&gt;

In 2006, Montiel Klint inhabited the trolleybus at Plaza Luis Cabrera in Colonia Roma, blocked from view for two months with only eight photographs on the outside of the bus for visitors to see. The interior of the bus was covered with about 5,000 paper cups to isolate it from the outside. The work was called the Galeria Experimental de Arte (Experimental Gallery of Art).&lt;ref name="soledad"&gt;{{cite news |title= Aislan la soledad en trolebus |first= Julieta |last= Riveroll |newspaper=[[Reforma]] |location=Mexico City |date=February 15, 2006 |page=12 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Suspended Black” by Víctor Noxpango had one of the trolleybuses elevated on six hydraulic jacks and painted completely black.&lt;ref name="intervencion"&gt;{{cite news |title= Albergará Trolebús/Galería la intervención-video "Suspended Black". |newspaper=Notimex  |location=Mexico City |date=January 28, 2008 |page= |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; After artist Israel Meza Moreno created a work called Nido de Malvivientes in 2007 with one of the trolleybuses, the Fundación Jumex commissioned a similar work, which was bought by a private collector and later acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The work consisted of covering the interior of the trolleybus with cardboard pieces on which phrases from young thieves whom the artists had interviewed were written. The windows were covered with newspaper front pages with violent headlines.&lt;ref name="revisan"/&gt; Alvaro Verduzco’s work was called “Túnel” (Tunnel) in 2009, which used a cone made of cardboard with the bus to create the illusion of infinity.&lt;ref name="verduzco"&gt;{{cite news |title= Presenta Alvaro Verduzco su proyecto "Túnel" en el Trolebús Galería |newspaper=Notimex  |location=Mexico City |date=August 5, 2009 |page= |language=Spanish |url=http://www.publimetro.com.mx/entretenimiento/presenta-alvaro-verduzco-su-proyecto-tunel-en-el-trolebus-galeria/nihe!9riREI9gXX7N86gXm2NFEw/ |accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery ceased operations due to financial difficulties. The various projects that took place during that time drew both praise and criticism from the residents of the various neighborhoods. The art projects were best received in Colonia Roma and least in Colonia Condesa.&lt;ref name="revisan"/&gt;

==Post-Galería==
Since then, the three trolleybuses remain in their respective locations. The borough government still allows artists, community members and even advertisers to paint the buses periodically, painting over whatever was there previously. In February 2012, the trolleybus in Colonia Hipódromo was painted by Japanese artist Fumiko Nakashima with her work given the title of “Doble Vida” or “Double Life.”&lt;ref name="haru"/&gt; The work was to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japan earthquake and tsunami]], along with a ceremony on March 11, 2012.&lt;ref name="conmemora"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nava Polina |first= Joel |date=April 2012 |title= Arte public que conmemora un ‘nuevo tipo’ de paz.

It was sponsored by the [[Garros Galería]] in Mexico City, the Fundación Japón México and the Cuauhtémoc borough.&lt;ref name="haru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minao"&gt;{{cite news |title=私の故郷、ブラシに含浸気持ち。 |author=Ota Minao |newspaper=Asahi Shimbun |date=March 8, 2012 |page=12 |language=Japanese |trans-title=My hometown, paintbrush impregnated with feelings }}&lt;/ref&gt;
