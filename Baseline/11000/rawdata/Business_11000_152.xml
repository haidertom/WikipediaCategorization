Significant Group's companies include: Astaldi Concessioni, NBI, Astaldi Construction Corp., NBI, TEQ Construction Enterprise.

==History==
The company was founded in 1929 by Sante Astaldi, and a member of the Astaldi family remains on the company's board. Astaldi was involved in many major European civil works projects pre-[[World War II]], including the Rome-Naples railroad. After the war, the company extended its activities to Africa, where it focused on road construction. Between the 1950s and the 70s, Astaldi's presence was introduced to the Middle East, Central and South America, and the Far East. The company split into Impresa Astaldi Estero SpA (for foreign markets) and Impresa Astaldi Estero SpA (for Italian projects) in 1950, but merged to form the present-day Astaldi SpA in the 1980s. Astaldi continued to diversify its projects, entering new markets in the [[United States]], [[Turkey]] and [[Indonesia]] throughout the 80s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infrapppworld.com/companies/astaldi|title=Astaldi|publisher=Infra PPP World|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business Network International''' ('''BNI''') is an American franchised networking organization with around 233,000 members in 8,399 local chapters worldwide. Members meet weekly to discuss business and support each other's businesses by sharing [[Referral marketing|referrals]]. It claims to be the world's leading 'referral organization'&lt;!-- note: the term 'referral organisation' is not defined in WP or elsewhere, and therefore should be used with caution--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bni.com |title= BNI web page|accessdate=2013-06-14 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080222025448/http://www.bni.com/| archivedate= 22 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the organization says its members generated referrals resulting in over $9.3 billion in closed business worldwide. 

In 2016, this figure increased to $11.2 billion business passed between members and their referrals (worldwide) and in 2017, $13.6 billion worth of business was passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bni.com/BNINews/tabid/64/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/175/BNI-Launches-41st-and-42nd-Countries.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; BNI was founded in 1985 by [[Ivan Misner]].&lt;ref name="ccn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Technology Is Rewarding Close Personal Relationships |accessdate=2008-09-17 |date=2006-02-23 |work=California Science &amp; Technology News |url=http://www.ccnmag.com/article/why_technology_is_rewarding_close_personal_relationships |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929074614/http://www.ccnmag.com/article/why_technology_is_rewarding_close_personal_relationships }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sept 2018, this figure grew to $15.5 billion worth of done deals passed between members, with over 242k members worldwide in 8,653 chapters across 70 countries and 10.4 million referrals passed between them. It is one of the biggest networking organization of its kind in the world.

==Operational==
Local BNI chapters arrange weekly meetings for people from various industries and encourage the building of relationships and the passing of referrals. Members mostly consist of small business owners but medium and large organisations are also represented. Anyone can apply for membership providing they are wiling to attend the weekly meeting, are operating a full-time business and as most Executive Directors would agree, are in a position to grow and scale their business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business2community.com/small-business/6-reasons-join-bni-group-01088173 6 Reasons NOT to Join a BNI Group], by Ivana Taylor, Business to Community, 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Basic Income Performance in Bern, Oct 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|On 4 October 2013, Swiss activists from Generation Grundeinkommen organized a performance in Bern in which roughly 8 million coins, one coin representing one person out of Switzerland's population, were dumped on a public square. This was done in celebration of the successful collection of more than 125,000 signatures, forcing the government to hold a [[Swiss referendums, 2016#Basic income referendum|referendum]] on whether or not to incorporate the concept of basic income in the Federal constitution. The measure did not pass, with 76.9% voting against changing the Federal constitution to support basic income.&lt;ref name="Vorlage Nr. 601"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20160605/det601.html |title = Vorlage Nr. 601 – Vorläufige amtliche Endergebnisse |author =  |date =  |work = admin.ch |accessdate = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''basic income''', also called '''basic income guarantee''', '''universal basic income''' ('''UBI'''), '''basic living stipend''' ('''BLS'''), or '''universal demogrant''', is a type of program&lt;ref&gt;Basic income is distinct from [[welfare]] in that it may have no [[means test]], and distinct from the definition of [[Social security]] for the same reason; it is more like an insurance program such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) Social Security] in the United States, which is [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5R44srUbsUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22social%20security%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20security%22&amp;f=false defined as a "federal insurance" program]; nevertheless, strictly speaking Basic income does not fit the definition of other types of programs, although it is properly categorized under the general term [[Welfare state]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which citizens (or permanent residents) of a country, or any other region, may receive a regular sum of money from a source such as the government. A pure or unconditional basic income has no [[means test]], but unlike [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security in the United States]] it is distributed automatically to all citizens without a requirement to notify changes in the citizen's financial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ |title = History of Basic Income |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |archivedate = 21 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3013634 Universal Basic Income: A Review] Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 6 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Basic income can be implemented nationally, regionally or locally. 

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]), is called full basic income, while if it is less than that amount, it is called partial'''.''' A related welfare system is [[negative income tax]], in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labor income. Some welfare systems are related to basic income but have certain conditions. As these are not universal, they are more often referred to as [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, Bolsa Família in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=Sánchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Família, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|date=2011|page=1|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1468018111421297|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several political discussions that are related to the basic income debate. One prime example is the debates around robotisation, AI (artificial intellegence) and the future of work. One key issue in these debates is whether robotisation and AI will take away lots of jobs or not. Basic income often comes up as a proposal in these kind of discussion, especially for those who believe in less jobs in the future due to the new and expanding technologies. 

== History ==
{{See also|Basic income around the world}}
The idea of a state-run basic income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]] argued in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' that every person should receive a guaranteed income,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce Covert, "What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income – and its limitations", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (September 10 / 17, 2018), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the late 18th century when [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system in which all citizens were guaranteed a certain income. In the 19th century and until the 1960s the debate on basic income was limited, but in the 1960s and 1970s the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onwards the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that are related to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Família]] in Brazil. From 2008 and onwards there have also been several experiments with basic income and related systems. Especially in countries with an existing welfare state a part of the funding assumably comes from replacing the current welfare arrangements, or a part of it, such as different grants for unemployed people. Apart from that there are several ideas and proposals regarding the rest of the financing, as well as different ideas about the level and other aspects.

The idea of an unconditional basic income, given to all citizens in a state (or all adult citizens), was first presented near the middle of the 19th century. But long before that there were ideas of a so-called minimum income, the idea of a one-off grant and the idea of a [[social insurance]] (which still is a key feature of all modern welfare states, with insurances for and against unemployment, sickness, parenthood, accidents, old age and so forth).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The minimum income, the idea to eradicate poverty by targeting the poor, is in contradiction with basic income given "to all", but nevertheless share some underlying ideas about the state's or the city's welfare responsibilities towards its citizens. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492–1540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents, "not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity". However, to be entitled to poor relief the person’s poverty must not, he argued, be undeserved, but he or she must "deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ History of Basic Income] Basic Income Earth Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794). After playing a prominent role in the French Revolution, he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the Convention Thomas Paine (1737–1809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet’s death.

The first social movement for basic income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Dennis Milner]] (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas|Clifford H. Douglas]].

* Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.
* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled “Scheme for a State Bonus” (1918). There they argued for the "introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.
* Clifford H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system called "social credit", a combination of monetary reform and basic income.

In 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]], led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]], developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance and selective grants. Committee member Lady [[Rhys-Williams]] argued for basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.&lt;ref name=sloman-2015&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition= 1st publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with negative income tax. Then US president Richard Nixon once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the US Congress—but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but on the other hand it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years. From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest. In West Germany, groups of unemployed people took a stance for the reform.&lt;ref name="archiv-grundeinkommen.de"&gt;Ronald Blaschke [http://www.archiv-grundeinkommen.de/blaschke/20100127-The-Basic-Income-debate-in-Germany.pdf The basic income debate in Germany and some basic reflections] (läst 13 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005–2010 and onwards, basic income again became an active topic in many countries. Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives—including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. Experiments in [[India]], [[Finland]], and [[Canada]], for example, have received international media attention. Several countries have used polls to investigate public support for basic income. In 2016, 76.9% of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] voters in a national referendum rejected a basic income proposal.

==Perspectives in the basic income debate==
=== Transparency and administrative efficiency ===
Basic income is potentially a much simpler and more transparent [[welfare|welfare system]] than [[welfare state]]s currently use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standing|first=Guy|title=How Cash Transfers Promote the Case for Basic Income|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis.2008.3.1/bis.2008.3.1.1106/bis.2008.3.1.1106.xml?form=|journal=Basic Income Studies|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.2202/1932-0183.1106|issn=1932-0183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of separate welfare programs (including unemployment insurance, child support, pensions, disability, housing support) it could be one income, or it could be a basic payment that welfare programs could add to.&lt;ref&gt;[[G Standing]], ''Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen'' (2017) ch 7. E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN], part 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This could require less paperwork and bureaucracy to check eligibility. The lack of means test or similar bureaucracy would allow for saving on [[social welfare]], which could be put towards the grant. The [[Basic Income Earth Network]] (BIEN) claims that basic income costs less than current means-tested social welfare benefits, and has proposed an implementation that it claims to be financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/basic-income/faq/ |title = BIEN: frequently asked questions |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/research/ |title = Research |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network |access-date =  |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A real world example of how basic income is being implemented to save money can be seen in the program that is being conducted by the Netherlands in a few cities. The city councillor for the city of Nijmegen, Lisa Westerveld had this to say in an interview -  “In Nijmegen we get £88m to give to people on welfare, but it costs £15m a year for the civil servants running the bureaucracy of the current system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/dutch-city-utrecht-basic-income-uk-greens|title=Dutch city plans to pay citizens a ‘basic income’, and Greens say it could work in the UK|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|date=2015-12-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is also shared by Dutch historian and author Rutger Bregman who believes the Netherlands welfare system is flawed and also economist Loek Groot who believes the country welfare system wastes too much money .The outcomes of this program will be analysed by eminent economist Loek Groot, a professor at the University of Utrecht who hopes to learn if a guaranteed income might be a more effective approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/netherlands-utrecht-universal-basic-income-experiment/487883/|title=The Netherlands' Upcoming Experiment With Universal Basic Income|last=Hamilton|first=Tracy Brown|date=2016-06-21|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other proponents argue for adding basic income to existing welfare grants, rather than replacing them.

=== Poverty reduction ===

Advocates of basic income often argue that it has a potential to reduce or even [[poverty reduction|eradicate poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/06/utopian-thinking-poverty-universal-basic-income|title=Utopian thinking: the easy way to eradicate poverty – Rutger Bregman|first=Rutger|last=Bregman|date=6 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a randomized controlled study done by the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] on the Give Directly program that took place in the Rarieda District of Kenya , the impact of the UBI program saw for every $1,000 disbursed a $270 increase in earnings, a $430 increase in assets, $330 increase in nutrition spending with 0% effect on alcohol or tobacco spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly|title=Research at GiveDirectly|website=GiveDirectly|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom ===

[[File:Philippe Van Parijs (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Philippe Van Parijs]]

[[Philippe van Parijs|Philippe Van Parijs]] has argued that basic income at the highest sustainable level is needed to support [[real freedom]], or the freedom to do whatever one "might want to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR25.5/vanparijs.html|title=A Basic Income for All|website=bostonreview.net|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Van Parijs means that all people should be free to use the resources of the Earth and the "external assets" people make out of them to do whatever they want. Money is like an access ticket to use those resources, and so to make people equally free to do what they want with world assets, the government should give each individual as many such access tickets as possible—that is, the highest sustainable basic income.

Karl Widerquist and others have proposed a theory of freedom in which basic income is needed to protect the power to refuse work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137274724|title=Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income - A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No - K. Widerquist - Palgrave Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory goes like this:

If some other group of people controls resources necessary to an individual's survival, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. But today, resources necessary to the production of food, shelter, and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not. Therefore, this argument goes, the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012" /&gt; Under this argument, personal, political, and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no. In this view, basic income provides an economic freedom, which—combined with political freedom, freedom of belief, and personal freedom—establish each individual's status as a free person.

=== Gender equality ===
The Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]] has argued that basic income is a way to promote [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="mckay1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Ailsa |year=2005 |title= The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens Basic Income |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= 9781134287185 |author-link=Ailsa McKay }}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted in 2001 that "social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market" and that "the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights."&lt;ref name="mckay1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97–118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments from different ideologies ===

* Georgist views: [[Geolibertarian]]s seek to synthesize propertarian libertarianism and a geoist (or [[Georgist]]) philosophy of [[land (economics)|land]] as unowned commons or equally owned by all people, citing the [[classical economics|classical economic]] distinction between unimproved land and private property. The rental value of land is produced by the labors of the community and, as such, rightly belongs to the community at large and not solely to the landholder. A [[land value tax]] (LVT) is levied as an annual fee for exclusive access to a section of earth, which is collected and redistributed to the community either through [[public good]]s, such as public security or a court system, or in the form of a basic guaranteed income called a [[citizen's dividend]]. Geolibertarians view the LVT as a [[single tax]] to replace all other methods of taxation, which are deemed unjust violations of the [[non-aggression principle]].
* Right-wing views: Support for basic income has been expressed by several people associated with [[right-wing]] political views. While adherents of such views generally favor minimization or abolition of the public provision of [[welfare]] services, some have cited basic income as a viable strategy to reduce the amount of bureaucratic administration that is prevalent in many contemporary welfare systems. Others have contended that it could also act as a form of compensation for [[fiat currency]] inflation.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/01/27/a-universal-basic-income-conservative-progressive-and-libertarian-perspectives-part-3-of-a-series/ |title = A Universal Basic Income: Conservative, Progressive, and Libertarian Perspectives |publisher = [[EconoMonitor]] |date = 27 January 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Dolan, Ed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-2013-5 |title = There's A Way To Give Everyone In America An Income That Conservatives And Liberals Can Both Love |work = [[Business Insider]] |date = 13 May 2013 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Weisenthal, Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conservative"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/ |title = The Conservative Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income |work = [[The Atlantic]] |date = 6 August 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Gordon, Noah }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Feminist views: [[Feminist]] views on the basic income are loosely divided into two opposing views. One view supports basic income as a means of guaranteeing minimum financial independence for women, and of recognizing women's [[unpaid work]] in the home. The opposing Feminist view opposes basic income as something that might discourage women from participation in the workforce—reinforcing traditional gender roles of women belonging in the private area and men in the public area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf | title=Basic Income and Feminism: in terms of "the gender division of labor" | author=Kaori Katada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gcu.ac.uk/wise/media/gcalwebv2/theuniversity/centresprojects/wise/90324WiSE_BriefingSheet.pdf | title=Beyond Care: Expanding the Feminist Debate on Universal Basic Income | publisher=WiSE | date=September 2015 | author=Caitlin McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===

One argument against basic income is that if people have free and unconditional money, they will "get lazy" and not work as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:198164 |title = urn:nbn:se:su:diva-7385: Just Distribution : Rawlsian Liberalism and the Politics of Basic Income |publisher = Diva-portal.org |accessdate = 16 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cangov94"&gt;{{cite web |author = Gilles Séguin |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm#Disposable |title = ''Improving Social Security in Canada – Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper'', Government of Canada, 1994 |publisher = Canadiansocialresearch.net |accessdate = 16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plcdib/imprints/vanparijsinterview.html The Need for Basic Income]: An Interview with [[Philippe Van Parijs]], ''Imprints'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (March 1997). The interview was conducted by Christopher Bertram.&lt;/ref&gt; Less work means less tax revenue, argue critics, and hence less money for the state and cities to fund public projects. The degree of any disincentive to employment because of basic income would likely depend on how generous the basic income was.

Some studies have looked at employment levels during the experiments with basic income and negative income tax, and similar systems. In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher. Participants in these experiments, however, knew that the experiment was limited in time.&lt;ref name="cangov94" /&gt;

In the [[Mincome]] experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba, also in the 1970s, there were also slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Belik |first = Vivian |url = http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100 |title = A Town Without Poverty?

Also according to a recent study done on the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend which is the most large scale universal basic income program in the United States that has been running since 1976 has showed that this belief is not true. The researchers from University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy professor Damon Jones and University of Pennsylvania School of Public Policy and Practice professor Ioana Marinescu have established that even though there is only a very small decrease in work done by recipients due to various reasons like the ones we saw in the Manitoba experiment,however there has been a 17 percent increase in part time jobs.The authors theorized employment remained steady because the extra income that allowed people to buy more also increased demand for service jobs, a finding consistent with the economic data of the time. There was no effect seen when it came to jobs, such as those in manufacturing, that produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment.To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses her dividend to help with car payments can cut back on her hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. But because more people are spending more, the store will look to replace that worker who started working less. Meanwhile, the distribution of the dividend won't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop — Quartz|website=qz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working — but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work, and not dissuade people out of the work force.

Another study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]]; the assessment of the project after its conclusion found that economic activity actually increased, particularly through the launch of small businesses, and reinforcement of the local market by increasing households' buying power.&lt;ref name="bignam"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bignam.org/BIG_pilot.html |title = Basic Income Grant Coalition: Pilot Project |publisher = BIG Coalition Namibia |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the residents of Omitara were described as suffering "dehumanising levels of poverty" before the introduction of the pilot, and as such the project's relevance to potential implementations in developed economies is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Otjivero residents to get bridging allowance as BIG pilot ends |url = http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/december/article/otjivero-residents-to-get-bridging-allowance-as-big-pilot-ends/ |accessdate = 28 July 2016 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303041632/http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/december/article/otjivero-residents-to-get-bridging-allowance-as-big-pilot-ends/ |archivedate = 3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Meade]] states that a return to [[full employment]] can only be achieved if, among other things, workers offer their services at a low enough price that the required wage for unskilled labor would be too low to generate a socially desirable distribution of income. He therefore concludes that a "citizen's income" is necessary to achieve full employment without suffering stagnant or negative growth in wages.&lt;ref&gt;Meade, James Edward. ''Full Employment Regained?'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-55697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is a disincentive to employment because of basic income, the magnitude of such a disincentive may depend on how generous the basic income was. Some campaigners in Switzerland have suggested a level that would be only just liveable, arguing that people would want to supplement it.&lt;ref name="harford"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://timharford.com/2013/11/a-universal-income-is-not-such-a-silly-idea/ |title = Tim Harford — Article —  A universal income is not such a silly idea |author = Wolf Chiappella |work = Tim Harford |accessdate = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Worstall]], a writer, blogger and Senior Fellow of the [[Adam Smith Institute]],&lt;ref name="ASI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/about-us/key-people/fellows/page/2/ |title=Fellows |publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that traditional welfare schemes create a disincentive to work because such schemes typically cause people to lose benefits at around the same rate that their income rises (a form of [[welfare trap]] where the [[marginal tax rate]] is 100 percent). He has asserted that this particular disincentive is not a property shared by basic income since the rate of increase is positive at all incomes.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/07/12/an-unconditional-basic-income-is-the-solution-but-the-important-word-here-is-basic/ |publisher = Forbes |first = Tim |last = Worstall |title = Forbes article |date = 12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad behavior ===

There are concerns that some people will spend their basic income on alcohol and other drugs.&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, Kenya. "Pennies From Heaven." Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67–68. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of the impact of direct cash transfer programs provide evidence to the contrary. A 2014 [[World Bank]] review of 30 scientific studies concludes that "concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco consumption are unfounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

===Reduction of medical costs ===

The [[Canadian Medical Association]] passed a motion in 2015 in clear support of basic income and for basic income trials in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/08/26/basic-income-just-what-the-doctor-ordered.html|title=Opinion - Basic income: just what the doctor ordered|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], a British journalist, has stated that universal basic income would probably reduce the high medical costs associated with diseases of poverty. The stress, diseases like high blood pressure, type II diabetes etc. would according to Mason probably become less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQyr9l22fLE |title = Paul Mason: 'PostCapitalism'&amp;nbsp;– Talks at Google |first =  |last = Talks at Google |date = 3 March 2016 |publisher =  |accessdate = 28 July 2016 |via = YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage slavery and alienation ===

[[Frances Fox Piven]] argues that an income guarantee would benefit all workers by liberating them from the anxiety that results from the "tyranny of [[wage slavery]]" and provide opportunities for people to pursue different occupations and develop untapped potentials for creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Goldin, Debby Smith, Michael Smith (2014). ''Imagine: Living in a Socialist USA.'' [[Harper Perennial]]. {{ISBN|0-06-230557-3}} p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[André Gorz]] saw basic income as a necessary adaptation to the increasing automation of work, yet basic income also enables workers to overcome the [[Social alienation|alienation]] in work and life and to increase the amount of [[leisure time]].&lt;ref&gt;André Gorz, [http://societal.org/docs/55.htm Pour un revenu inconditionnel suffisant], published in Transversales/Science-Culture (n° 3, 3e trimestre 2002) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic growth ===

Some proponents have argued that basic income can increase [[economic growth]] because it would sustain people while they invest in education to get interesting and well-paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Michael 2015"&gt;Tanner, Michael. "The Pros and Cons of a Guaranteed National Income." Policy Analysis. CATO institute, 12 May 2015, Web. 2, 7 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012"&gt;Sheahen, Allan. Basic Income Guarantee: Your Right to Economic Security. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Book. 29 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also a discussion of basic income within the [[degrowth]] movement, which argues against economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2016/08/basic-income-sustainable-consumption-degrowth-movement/|title=Basic Income, sustainable consumption and the 'DeGrowth' movement   {{!}} BIEN|date=2016-08-13|newspaper=BIEN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Automation ===

The debates about basic income and automation are closely linked. For example, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] argues that the increase in automation creates a greater need for basic income. Concerns about automation have prompted many in the high-technology industry to argue for basic income as an implication of their business models.

Many technologists believe that automation (among other things) is creating [[technological unemployment]]. Journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] first highlighted the turn of the "tech elite" to these ideas with an article in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, which cited [[Marc Andreessen]], [[Sam Altman]], [[Peter Diamandis]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|date=6 January 2015|publisher=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obamawhitehouse.archives.gov"&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf whitehouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Schneider |first = Nathan |title = Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income |date = 6 January 2015 |url = https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1 |publisher = Vice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies about automation and jobs validate these concerns. The US White House, in a report to the US Congress, estimated that a worker earning less than $20 an hour in 2010 will eventually lose their job to a machine with 83% probability. Even workers earning as much as $40 an hour faced a probability of 31%.&lt;ref name="obamawhitehouse.archives.gov"/&gt; With a rising [[unemployment]] rate, poor communities will become more impoverished worldwide. Proponents of universal basic income argue that it could solve many world problems like high work stress and could create more opportunities and efficient and effective work. This claim is supported by some studies. In a study in Dauphin, Manitoba, only 13% of labor decreased from a much higher expected number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forget |first=Evelyn L. |title=The Town With No Poverty: The Health Effects of a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income Field Experiment |journal=Canadian Public Policy |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=283–305 |doi=10.3138/cpp.37.3.283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in several Indian villages, basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Abhishek |last=Roy |work=Sevenpillarsinstitute.org |accessdate=16 July 2017 |title=Part 2 of SPI’s Universal Basic Income Series |url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/universal-basic-income-empirical-studies/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Yang , an upcoming presidential candidate talks about how automation is negatively affecting real people when it takes over their jobs in his book The War On Normal People, he says that even though automation might make the economy and market more efficient it is not being used positively to help people.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029200003|title=The war on normal people : the truth about America's disappearing jobs and why universal basic income is our future.|last=(Entrepreneur),|first=Yang, Andrew|isbn=9780316414227|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=1029200003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not creating enough new jobs than the number of old jobs it is replacing. An example of this is - In 2004, BlockBuster was making $6 billion with 84,000 employees. Netflix has so far made $9 billion dollars with only 4,500 employees. Other places where automation is rapidly replacing people is self driving cars, nearly 3 million jobs in the US will be replaced in the next 10 years it is not a question of if they will be replaced but how quickly they will be displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Ella_alderson/these-jobs-are-most-at-stake-to-be-replaced-by-robots-ce4096c2ceb9|title=These Jobs are Most at Stake to be Replaced by Robots|last=Alderson|first=Ella|date=2018-05-13|website=Medium|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one problem most critics of automation don't realise and argue that automation will create new jobs, but automation is so different this time compared to the Industrial Revolution because peoples livelihood is being displaced in an unprecedented scale and when these people lose the option to pursue these kinds of jobs they will have to be retrained and even then they might not be hired and leave the workforce entirely.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"/&gt;

Besides technological unemployment, some tech-industry experts worry that automation will destabilize the labor market or increase economic inequality. One example is Chris Hughes, co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years; it has not permanently reduced the employment rate but has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vallée]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility than it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vallée examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that human labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|work=Google Docs|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic critique ===

[[Daron Acemoglu]], Professor in economics at MIT, has expressed doubts about basic income with the following statement: "Current US status quo is horrible. A more efficient and generous social safety net is needed. But UBI is expensive and not generous enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437296/economists-against-ubi |title = Majority of Economists Surveyed Are against the Universal Basic Income |access-date = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Maskin]] has stated that "a minimum income makes sense, but not at the cost of eliminating Social Security and Medicare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_bPBNf8WXrT4jmtf|title=Poll Results {{!}} IGM Forum|website=www.igmchicago.org|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Simeon Djankov]], professor at the [[London School of Economics]], argues the costs of a generous system are prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Yang , the presidential candidate wants to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen between 18 and 64 years old. He wants to achieve this by introducing a Value Added Tax  he says even conservatives have known that a [[Value-added tax|VAT]] was going to be necessary at some point in the future, and this is a great opportunity for us to rebalance our economy. We’re the only major economy that doesn’t have a VAT right now; it’s going to be increasingly necessary given the progressive automation we’re already experiencing.

===Basic income as a part of a post-capitalistic economic system===

[[File:ErikOlinWright.2013.jpg|thumb|right|Erik Olin Wright, 2013.]]
   
Harry Shutt proposed basic income and other measures to make all or most enterprises collective rather than private. These measures would create a post-capitalist economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Shutt |first = Harry |title = Beyond the Profits System: Possibilities for the Post-Capitalist Era |publisher = Zed Books |date = 15 March 2010 |isbn = 978-1-84813-417-1 |page = 124 |quote = a flat rate payment as of right to all resident citizens over the school leaving age, irrespective of means of employment status...it would in principle replace all existing social-security entitlements with the exception of child benefits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
[[Erik Olin Wright]] characterizes basic income as a project for reforming capitalism into an economic system by empowering labor in relation to capital, granting labor greater bargaining power with employers in labor markets, which can gradually de-commodify labor by decoupling work from income. This would allow for an expansion in scope of the "social economy", by granting citizens greater means to pursue activities (such as the pursuit of art) that do not yield strong financial returns.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Erik Olin. [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Basic%20Income%20as%20a%20Socialist%20Project.pdf "Basic Income as a Socialist Project,"] paper presented at the annual US-BIG Congress, 4 – 6 March 2005 (University of Wisconsin, March 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
James Meade advocated for a social dividend scheme to be funded by publicly owned [[Means of production|productive assets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mediahell.org/capitalsocial.htm |title = Basic Income |publisher = Media Hell |accessdate = 9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell argued for a basic income alongside public ownership as a means of shortening the average working day and achieving full employment.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Roads to Freedom. Socialism, Anarchism and Syndicalism'', London: Unwin Books (1918), pp. 80–81 and 127&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Economists and sociologists have advocated for a form of basic income as a way to distribute economic profits of publicly owned enterprises to benefit the entire population (also referred to as a ''[[social dividend]]''), where the basic income payment represents the return to each citizen on the capital owned by society. These systems would be directly financed from returns on publicly owned assets and are featured as major components of many models of [[market socialism]].&lt;ref name="Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor = 40470892  |title = Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism |last = Marangos |first = John |journal = International Journal of Political Economy |volume = 34 |issue = 3 |year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guy Standing]] has proposed financing a [[social dividend]] from a democratically-accountable [[sovereign wealth fund]] built up primarily from the proceeds of a levy on rentier income derived from ownership or control of assets - physical, financial and intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy. "Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen, London: Penguin (2017){{cite web | url = https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/304706/basic-income/ |accessdate = 1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy.

[[Herman Daly]], considered as one of the founders of [[ecologism]], argued primarily for a [[Steady-state economy|zero growth economy]] within the ecological limits of the planet. But to have such a green and [[sustainable economy]], including basic economic welfare and security to all people, he wrote a lot about the need for structural reforms of the capitalistic system, including basic income, monetary reform, [[land value tax]], trade reforms and higher [[eco-taxes]] (taxes on pollution and CO2). For him, basic income was thus part of a larger structural change of the economic system, towards a more green and sustainable system.

==National debates (a few examples) ==

{{Main|Basic income around the world}}

===Germany===

A commission of the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] discussed basic income in 2013 and concluded that it is "unrealizable" because:
* it would cause a significant decrease in the motivation to work among citizens, with unpredictable consequences for the national economy
* it would require a complete restructuring of the taxation, social insurance and pension systems, which will cost a significant amount of money
* the current system of social help in Germany is regarded as more effective because it is more personalized: the amount of help provided depends on the financial situation of the recipient; for some socially vulnerable groups, the basic income could be insufficient
* it would cause a vast increase in immigration
* it would cause a rise in the [[shadow economy]]
* the corresponding rise of taxes would cause more inequality: higher taxes would cause higher prices of everyday products, harming the finances of poor people
* no viable way to finance basic income in Germany was found&lt;ref name="bundestag.de"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2010/31904334_kw45_pa_petitionen/203030 |title = Deutscher Bundestag – Problematische Auswirkungen auf Arbeitsanreize |language = de |publisher = Bundestag.de |date =  |accessdate = 5 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/petitionen/_2008/_12/_10/Petition_1422.abschlussbegruendungpdf.pdf|title=Petitionen: Verwendung von Cookies nicht aktiviert&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

India has been considering [[basic income in India]]. On January 31, 2017, the Economic Survey of India included a 40-page chapter on UBI that outlined the 3 components of the proposed program: 1) universality, 2) unconditionality, 3) agency. The UBI proposal in India is framed with the intent of providing every citizen "a basic income to cover their needs," which is encompassed by the "universality" component. "Unconditionality" points to the accessibility of all to the basic income, without any means tests. The third component, "agency," refers to the lens through which the Indian government views the poor. According to the Survey, by treating the poor as agents rather than subjects, UBI "liberates citizens from paternalistic and clientelistic relationships with the state."

=== The Alaska Permanent Fund ===
The [[Alaska Permanent Fund|Permanent Fund of Alaska]] in the United States provides a kind of basic income, based on the oil and gas revenues of the state, to (nearly) all state residents. During her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], along with [[Bill Clinton|her husband]], considered including a policy similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund called "Alaska for America" as part of their platform after reading [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] book on the subject ''With Liberty and Dividends for All''. Ultimately, the Clintons decided not to, with Hillary stating in her [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]] memoir ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]'', "Unfortunately, we couldn't make the numbers work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|title=Hillary Clinton almost ran for president on a universal basic income|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/12/16296532/hillary-clinton-universal-basic-income-alaska-for-america-peter-barnes|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in retrospect Clinton also said, "I wonder now whether we should have thrown caution to the wind and embraced 'Alaska for America' as a long-term goal and figured out the details later", considering that former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretaries]] [[James Baker]] and [[Henry Paulson]] have also proposed a similar nationwide policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|author-link=Hillary Clinton|title=[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|place=New York|date=September 12, 2017|isbn=978-1-50117-556-5|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker et al. 2017"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Baker III|first1=James A.|author-link1=James Baker|last2=Feldstein|first2=Martin S.|author-link2=Martin Feldstein|last3=Halstead|first3=Ted|author-link3=Ted Halstead|last4=Mankiw|first4=N.

There are also several smaller experiments, which have been labeled as "basic income pilots". The best known are:

* Experiments with [[negative income tax]] in United States and Canada in the 1960s and 1970s.
* The province of [[Manitoba, Canada]], experimented with [[Mincome]], a basic guaranteed income in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouversun.com/business/local-business/innovation-series-feature-on-the-gig-economy|title=Innovation series: Does the gig economy mean 'endless possibilities' or the death of jobs?|date=8 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quasi - UBI Programs ===
[[Bolsa Família]] is a big social welfare program in Brazil that provides money to many poor families in the country. The system is related to basic income, but also has some differences in that there are some conditions like asking the recipients to keep their children in school till graduation. Brazilian Senator [[Eduardo Suplicy]] championed a law, ultimately passed in 2004, that declared Bolsa Família to be a first step towards a national basic income. However, the program has not yet been expanded in that direction.

[[Rythu Bandhu scheme]], is a welfare scheme started on 10 May 2018 aimed towards helping farmers that is being implemented by the State of [[Telangana]] in India where each farmland owner gets a fixed amount of money ₹4000 per acre twice a year for [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] and [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] harvests. A budget allocation of ₹12,000 crores($138 billion at the time of conversion) was made in 2018-19 state budget, the scheme offers a financial help of ₹8,000 per year to each farmer (two crops), and there is no cap on money disbursed to number of acres of land owned and it does not discriminate between rich or poor land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/telangana-proposes-rs-5l-insurance-cover-rs-12000-crore-support-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/63319240.cms|title=Telangana proposes Rs 5L insurance cover, Rs 12,000 crore support scheme for farmers|date=2018-03-15|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] has been monitoring the program and is doing a study which is yet to be published, but preliminary results have already shown promising results in getting farmers the welfare needed to make investments for farming and procuring fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and other inputs, serving the purpose of the scheme. The first phase of the survey concluded that 85% of farmers received check's for amounts ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹20,000 for farm land comprising less than an acre to about five acres and about 10% of farmers received check's for amounts above ₹20,000 to ₹50,000 and only 1% of farmers got amounts more than ₹50,000. The spending pattern revealed that a large chunk, 28.5% of farmers opted to buy seed, about 18% spent the money on fertilizer, 15.4% on new agricultural assets, including farm equipment , 8.6% on pesticides and some used it to engage farm labor and only 4.4% of beneficiaries said they utilized it for household consumption and a minuscule percentage for repayment of loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ryots-spent-rythu-bandhu-amount-judiciously-survey/article24235239.ece|title=Ryots spent Rythu Bandhu amount judiciously: survey|last=Maitreyi|first=M. l Melly|date=2018-06-23|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme received a high satisfaction rate of 92% from farmers since other forms of capital investment like welfare or loans had many strings attached to it and would not reach the farmers before the cropping season starts, many other states and countries are following the development of the program to see if they can implement it for their farmers. Since farmers worldwide are facing many difficulties and in a lot of countries it has become unprofitable, governments are either proving subsidies, welfare or loans but this a new type of program that is considered as an embryonic UBI or QUBI (Quasi) to replace traditional systems of agricultural support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/quasi-ubi-rythu-bandhu-can-be-the-social-agri-policy-template/1239581/|title=Quasi-UBI: Rythu Bandhu can be the social &amp; agri policy&amp;nbsp;template|date=2018-07-11|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic income in crypto currencies and as part of social media apps ===

[[Nimses]] is a concept that offers universal basic income to every member of its system.&lt;ref&gt;https://futurism.com/what-will-the-currency-of-a-workless-cashless-future-be/&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Nimses consists of [[time-based currency]] called Nim. 1 nim = 1 minute of life. Every person in Nimses receives nims that can be spent on different goods and services. This concept was initially adopted in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/ukrainian-tech-startup-turns-online-time-digital-cash.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2014, 3.7% of global land under sugar cane was Bonsucro certified,&lt;ref name="BonsucroNumbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonsucro.com/site/in-numbers/ |title=Bonsucro in numbers |publisher=Bonsucro | accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; with member organisations spread over 20 countries.&lt;ref name="BonsucroMembers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonsucro.com/site/members/list-of-members/ |title=List of Members |publisher=Bonsucro | accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonsucro has 207 members from various countries and sectors across the world. These are predominantly companies and grower associations involved in the sugar cane sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/bonsucro-better-sugar-initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonsucro is one of few certifications to have developed measures for [[greenhouse gas]] emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Steering Committee of the State-of-Knowledge Assessment of Standards and Certification | title = Toward Sustainability: The Roles and Limits of Certification | url = http://www.resolv.org/site-assessment/files/2012/06/Report-Only.pdf | publisher = Resolve | page = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently the [[European Commission]] has stated that the Bonsucro standard can be used to demonstrate compliance with the [[EU]] [[Renewables Directive]] (EU RED) when importing ethanol fuel,&lt;ref name="EUJournal"&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2011:190:TOC|title=Commission Implementing Decision of 19 July 2011 on the recognition of the ‘Bonsucro EU’ scheme for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability criteria under Directives 2009/28/EC and 2009/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council |journal=Official Journal of the European Union |date=2011-07-19 |author=European Communities |accessdate=2014-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Compilation of Bioenergy Sustainability Initiatives: Update | author1 = M Ismail | author2 =  A Rossi | author3 = N Geiger | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN | url =  http://www.fao.org/bioenergy/28175-0c514472daa6c71bd888358ab836edca2.pdf | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the standard had to be altered to comply fully.&lt;ref name="SolomonBailis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christine Moser|author2=Tine Hildebrandt|author3=Robert Bailis|editor=Barry D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11375">'''Chemical industry in Poland''' - one of the key branches of the processing industry which includes:

* [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[Chemistry &amp; Industry|chemistry industry]] – manufactures products on the basis of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[wood]], [[rubber]], [[fat]]s and other [[organic substance]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie |title = Analiza sytuacji rynkowej dla działalności gospodarczej na obszarze województwa zachodniopomorskiego dla branży chemicznej |location = Gdańsk |date = 2011|page= 11 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-organic]] chemistry industry – products manufactured on the basis of non-organic substances, e.g. [[mineral]]s and [[ore]]s.

Chemical industry in terms of tons of production can be divided into:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie |title = Analiza sytuacji rynkowej dla działalności gospodarczej na obszarze województwa zachodniopomorskiego dla branży chemicznej |location = Gdańsk |date = 2011|page= 4 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* great chemistry - the name refers to the production size of millions tons a year; great chemistry includes the production of [[Fertilizer|fertilisers,]] [[fuel]]s, [[plastic]]s (''mainly [[Plasticizer|plasticisers]]'') and [[industrial gas]]es;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chem.uw.edu.pl/people/AMyslinski/nowy/EChJ/wyklad_01.pdf | title = Chemia stosowana, odpady i zarządzanie chemikaliami | publisher = chem.uw.edu.pl | accessdate = 2016-06-22 | language = Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* small chemistry - production on a smaller scale - dozens of tons; this sector includes mainly chemistry with high added value and more expensive production, e.g. medicaments,cosmetics, [[cleaning agent]]s;
* chemical processing - processing finished half-products: by mixing, packing, thermal treatment and other methods.

Chemical industry is characteristic of the high capital intensity and low labour consumption, for this reason, the most of operations are automated.

== Chemical industry products==
Divisions within the Polish chemical industry, by types of products and companies, include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32914">The '''chocolate industry in the [[Philippines]]''' evidences the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] roots of the Philippine society. The growing of [[Cocoa bean|cacao or cocoa]] boasts a long history stretching from the [[Spanish Colonial Era (Philippines)|colonial]] times. Originating from [[Mesoamerica]]n forests, cacao was first introduced by the [[Spanish Colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonizers]] four centuries ago.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 2. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Philippine cocoa industry has been the primary producer of cocoa beans in the [[Southeast Asia]]. There are many areas of production of cacao in the Philippines, owing to its agriculture. The [[chocolate]] industry is currently on a small to medium scale.

== Etymology, history and development ==
{{See also|History of chocolate}}

=== Local terms ===
The word “[[chocolate]]” as we know it today was spelled in different ways throughout time, in different ways such as “chocalatall,” “jocolatte,” “jacolatte,” and “chockelet.” It is a derivative of the word ''cacahuatl'' or ''xocoatl'', a bitter drink the Aztecs brewed from cacao beans mixed with spices, wine, and other local ingredients that can be traced back to Pre-Columbian Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Boynton, Sandra. Chocolate: The Consuming Passion. New York: Workman, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cacahuatl'' is an amalgamation of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] words ''kaj'' and ''kab'', which translates to “bitter juice.” The suffix ''-atl'' that means water or liquid was added to ''kajkab'', forming ''kajkabatl,'' and then later ''kajkabhuatl'' with the insertion of the diphthong ''hu''.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Frederick. Turrialba (1960)  [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_ol0KGWC-f4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13 Cacao Manual]. Costa Rica: Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences, 1960. p. 13.

The cacao tree, whose scientific Latin name given by Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] in 1753 is ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'', is one of the 22 ''Theobroma'' species. ''Theobroma'' means “food for the Gods", from the Greek words ''theo'' (god) and ''broma'' (food). This species is utilized as raw materials for pharmaceutical products and cosmetics, however, cacao is primarily used for the production of chocolate and cocoa by processing the beans.

[[File:Champorado2.jpg|thumb|[[Champorado]] is a sweet chocolate rice [[porridge]] in [[Philippine cuisine]].]]

In the [[Filipino language]], chocolate is translated as ''tsokolate'', which is also a hot chocolate drink made from ''tablea''. ''Tablea'' are cacao tablets made from roasted and ground cacao nibs molded into rounds or tablets traditionally used in the Philippines for making hot chocolate. A ''batirol'', a wooden whisk-like instrument, is the Filipino adaptation of the Spanish word ''batidor'' that is utilized by rubbing the stick back and forth between one's palms in order to thoroughly mix hot water with the tablet in a chocolatera to make it frothy. The result is ''tsokolate de batirol'', a thick, creamy, hot chocolate drink, otherwise referred to as ''sikawate'' in the Visayas region.

''Tablea'' is also used in the production of ''[[champorado]]'', among many other cacao delicacies. Otherwise referred to as ''tsamporado,'' it is a sweet, rice porridge dish in the Philippines enjoyed by many hot or cold, usually partnered with dried fish, either ''tuyo'' or ''daing''.

=== Origin of cacao in the Philippines ===

The cacao plant was primarily brought to the Philippines in the 1700s when a [[Galleon|Spanish galleon]] from [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Manuel, and Andrés Naves. Flora De Filipinas. Manila: Plana, 1877. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; transported pure [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]], considered to be one of the best kinds of cacao, from [[Mesoamerica]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Although cacao trees were originally grown in Mexico and Central America, the Philippines became an ideal cultivation grounds for cacao because of its geography as a tropical rainforest located 10-15 degrees from the Earth's Equator, with the cacao belt located within 20 degrees of the Equator. Today, cacao trees are cultivated throughout equatorial region including the Caribbean, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands of Samoa and New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfu.ca/geog351fall03/groups-webpages/gp8/history/history.html "History of Chocolate"].

=== Key areas for production of Cacao ===
'''Batangas'''

Although the province of [[Batangas]] only accounts for 0.47 metric tons of cacao production {{as of|2016|lc=y}},&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystat.psa.gov.ph/?cont=10&amp;pageid=1&amp;ma=A60PNVOP|title=Production|last=|first=|date=|website=CountrySTAT Philippines|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is well known for its ''tsokolate'' ''tablea'' or chocolate tablets which are considered one of its delicacies and is often used to make traditional Filipino hot chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batangas-philippines.com/tablea-tsokolate.html.|title=Tablea Tsokolate or Cacao Chocolate.|last=|first=|date=|website=Batangas Philippines A Destination For Travelers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cebu'''

Cebu along with other [[Central Visayas]] provinces contribute only around 1% of cacao production in the country, however, in terms of producing world-class and award-winning chocolate, Cebu is known for producing quality cacao.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/business/2016/05/27/growing-cacao-cebu-475932|title=Growing cacao in Cebu|last=Galolo|first=Jeandie|date=May 26, 2016|work=SunStar Cebu|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are currently less than a hundred farmer associations, cooperatives, and individual growers planting on an estimated 2,000 hectares in Cebu, the province aims to have a greater share in cacao production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The province is home to ''criollo'' or the “cacao bisaya,” which is a superior quality cacao that has a strong, aromatic bittersweet taste and rich texture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.inquirer.net/209001/cacao-phs-hidden-treasure-goes-luxe|title=Cacao, PH’s ‘hidden treasure,’ goes luxe|last=Olchondra|first=Riza|date=March 30, 2016|work=Inquirer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also home to Ralfe Gourmet, The Chocolate Chamber, and Casa de Cacao headed by Raquel Choa who is known for elevating Philippine cacao-based products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Davao Region'''

== Chocolate industry in the Philippines ==

=== Industry background ===
Cacao, which originated from [[South America]]n forests, is the source material of chocolate products. However, modern cacao is mostly produced by African and European countries such as the [[Cocoa production in Ivory Coast|Ivory Coast]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 1. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As a minor player in the global industry, the Philippines also engages in cacao cultivation nearly everywhere around the [[archipelago]], even during the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyon|first1=William S.|title=Cacao Culture in the Philippines|date=1902|publisher=Bureau of Public Printing|location=Manila|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33921/33921-h/33921-h.htm|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cacao Industry ====
The Philippine cacao industry consists mostly of smallholder farmers who supply medium-scale manufacturers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacao / Tablea|url=http://industry.gov.ph/industry/cacao-tablea/|website=Securing the Future of Philippine Industries|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, domestic production is insufficient; local cacao demand outweighs the cacao supply both locally and globally. One major factor that affects caco production in the country is "the lack of post-harvest knowledge, equipment, and facilities to ensure bean quality for chocolate manufacturing." &lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 3. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that is the case, cacao exports are far less than country's imports. The Department of Trade and Industry Reports that in 2012, cacao imports amounted to 3,662 tons, while cacao exports amounted to only 512 tons.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Growing market opportunity for ''tablea'' ====
Recent increase in the number of cafes and restaurants offering chocolate or chocolate-based drinks provided for the relative rise of tablea market opportunities. In addition to that, healthy lifestyle trends in the past years contributed to this gradual increase of demand.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is seen as a good sign of possible profit translation for cacao farmers and manufacturers.

==== Commonwealth Food Inc. ====
Commonwealth Food Incorporated is a multiproduct Philippine based company that produces coffee, chocolate, and biscuit products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pana.com.ph/directories/commonwealth-foods-inc/ |title=COMMONWEALTH FOODS, INC. &amp;#124; Philippine Association of National Advertisers – PANA Website |publisher=Pana.com.ph |date= |accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their chocolate production is overseen by the Philippine Food Industries Incorporated branch which is also known as the Philfood division.

The Fibisco Biscuit Corporation is responsible for the production of Filipino-favorite chocolate snacks such as the Choco Mallows, Hi-ro, and Chocolate Chip cookies.

=== Future of Philippine chocolate industry ===
The supply of cocoa has fluctuated in recent years due to climate and economic factors. The [[El Niño|El Nino]] phenomenon that hit in the year 2009 greatly reduced the cocoa production in the following years. The extreme weather conditions added to the impending financial crises to limit both the supply and demand for cocoa. Cocoa supply is still decreasing even if the demand is rising. Many entrepreneurs and governments have been looking into cocoa production recently as demand for chocolate rises. They are looking to compete with the top producer of the plant which is Africa. They produce more than 70% of the global cocoa supply. On the other hand, Netherlands and United States of America are the largest consumers of cocoa beans; both consuming Billions of U.S Dollars' worth of the product.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database, the Philippines has shifted from a massive importer of cocoa beans into a steady exporter of the bean. Entrepreneurs had seen the potential of the cocoa bean industry.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The increase in demand and the falling supply was obvious to them, therefore giving them the idea of planting many hectares of the plant. The Philippine government has also been encouraging the citizens to grow cocoa beans because of the shortage. They are assisting farmers and the industry by supplying land and tested procedures in order to increase the Philippine production of cocoa beans.&lt;ref&gt;Quiros, Judy. "Shortage of cacao both a threat and an opportunity." Inquirer, June 15, 2013. Accessed June 26, 2017. Shortage of cacao both a threat and an opportunity.&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines has the right climate and soil for the cocoa tree which leaves the government the problem of spreading the knowledge on how to plant and harvest for cocoa.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Currently, they are making steady efforts to compete with other cocoa producers. The Philippine government is preparing for the cocoa shortage by the year 2020 and aims to increase production to 100,000 Metric Tons.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Nielberg (February 12, 2013). [http://www.confectionerynews.com/Commodities/Philippines-as-an-emerging-quality-cocoa-origin "Philippines as an emerging 'quality' cocoa origin"]. Accessed June 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Philippines is failing to meet the local demand of 30,000 Metric Tons, the strong effort and government support is sure to make an impact in years to come.

== Cocoa production in the Philippines ==
In the Philippines, [[Cocoa bean|Cacao or cocoa beans]] are produced in many locations. These include [[Luzon]], [[Mindanao]], [[Jolo|Joló]], [[Basilan]], [[Panay]], [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu|Cebú]], [[Bohol]], [[Masbate]] and many more.{{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=5}} Cocoa also refers to [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]] and [[cocoa butter]], which are two by-products of the cacao bean after it has undergone processing.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=16}} Cocoa and [[chocolate]] processing was first introduced in the country by Commonwealth Foods Inc. (ComFoods) in 1953, while Serg's Chocolate Products Inc. became the first modern chocolate manufacturing plant in [[Southeast Asia]]. {{sfn|Juan|2013|p=31}}

=== Process ===

==== Planting and farming ====
For planting cacao in the Philippines, there are currently 9 registered and approved varieties by the National Seed Industry of the Council of the Bureau of Plant Industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessdiary.com.ph/2191/cacao-production-guide/ "Growing Cacao - Cacao Production Guide | Business Diary Ph."] Your Business Diary. April 30, 2017. Accessed July 07, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are based on high productivity, quality of the bean, consumer acceptability and resistance to pests and diseases. [[Soil]] requirements include good soil structure, which is deep and well-drained, but with sufficient water-holding capacity.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=39}} Clay loam soil with an aggregate of [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]] work best due to its large pore spaces which "promote [[aeration]], [[drainage]], and moisture retention". Organic matter in the surface layer or soil is also important to cacao growth so the soil must be well-shaded to preserve the organic layer.&lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao]''. Philippines, 2016. 11. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal rainfall and climate on the other hand is between 1,250 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;mm per annum, 1,500 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm in the dry season of not more than 3 months, and a temperature from 18 degrees to 32 degrees Celsius. This suitable temperature can be found in altitudes up to 700 meters or in areas between 300 and 1,200 meters above sea level.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=39}} Because Cacao prefers a moisture-laden atmosphere, a climate of evenly distributed rainfall and few winds are ideal. {{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=6}}

After the seeds are selected carefully from highly productive trees which pest-free and disease-free, seeds are planted immediately either “at stake”, controlled seed beds, pots, or nurseries before they are transplanted to [[plantation]]s.{{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=11}} When field soils are forest land with good organic matter, [[tillage]] is not necessary. However, if the cacao is to be planted with other [[cash crop]]s, a more thorough preparation, which includes [[Plough|plowing]] and [[Harrow (tool)|harrowing]] the land, is needed. Roads, drainage, and shade trees are also established. Based on studies about distancing, cacao is generally planted in the following: cacao laid in rows 2 meters apart if open areas, 2.5 meters away from the base if under [[Coconut|coconut trees]], close planting followed by thinning, or 3 by 3 meters or 3 by 4 meters apart.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao].'' Philippines, 2016. 12. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trees raised from seeds are still practiced, grafted, budded, or asexually propagated cacao seedlings are now also practiced.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=40}}

==== Pruning ====
[[Pruning]] is generally done with great care using a sharp saw during [[wikipedia:Dry season|dry season]], when branches have come out, or after harvest as to control the height of the tree and facilitate the work. The first pruning, which is done to control the height of where the first branch is formed, is generally at least 5 feet, so as not to hinder harvesting and maintenance. When five or more branches have grown, weak branches are pruned, leaving only "three or four well-developed branches". The surfaces with cuts are then painted with coal tar or lead paint so as to protect the cuts from diseases or pests.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. [http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf ''A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao''.] Philippines, 2016. 13. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nutrition and fertilizers ====
The health of cacao trees are examined based on soil and leaf analyses. Mineral deficiencies are documented to determine [[fertilizer]] requirements. {{sfn|Juan|2013|p=42}} Fertilizers are applied on Cacao around two to three months after transplanting and are increased in the second, third and fourth year of a tree. The fertilizers used on Cacao include [[Ammonium sulfate]], Single superphosphate, [[Potassium sulfate]], and [[Magnesium sulfate]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Harvesting ====
Cacao pods are [[harvest]]ed as soon as they are [[Ripening|ripe]] or mature. The ripening period of cacao generally happens during dry season and can be determined either by the aroma of chocolate that pervades the plantation or the changing of pod color wherein they turn reddish or yellow according to the variety. {{sfn|Lyon|1902|p=17}} The pods are harvested using a sharp instrument such as a knife and are cut as close to the stem as possible. This is done with utmost care so as not to damage the flower cushions, pods, and tree itself. Infested pods are removed. About four harvest cycles with 10 to 21 days intervals are generally made per season.

==== Sorting and grading ====
[[Sorting]] and grading will enhance bean quality. When the beans have completely dried, they are sorted and graded to remove flat, slaty, black, moldy, small, double beans and beans with insect damage.{{sfn|Juan|2013|p=48}} Beans are usually graded based on proportion of defective beans indicated by the Philippine National Standards for Cacao or Cocoa Beans. These processing and manufacturing guidelines successfully ensure quality before they are shipped or handled.&lt;ref&gt;Peace and Equity Foundation. ''[http://pef.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Industry-Study_Cacao.pdf A primer on PEF’s Priority Commodities: an Industry Study on Cacao.]'' Philippines, 2016. 17. Accessed June 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Packaging and storage ====
The dried cocoa beans are packed in bags made of [[Food contact materials|food-grade]] or [[Non-toxic|non-toxic materials]] such as [[Jute|jute bags]] or sacks that an imprint of the label, production number, date, the grade of the beans, code of the cooperative, farmer or area.

A '''[[Credit (finance)|credit]] note''' or '''credit memorandum (memo)''' is a commercial document issued by a [[seller]] to a [[buyer]]. Credit notes act as a [[Source document]] for the Sales return journal. In other words the credit note is evidence of the reduction in sales. 

It can also be a document from a [[bank]] to a [[depositor]] to indicate the depositor's balance is being in event other than a deposit, such as the collection by the bank of the depositor's note receivable.

== Features ==

A credit note lists the products, quantities and agreed prices for products or services the seller provided the buyer, but the buyer returned or did not receive. It may be issued in the case of damaged goods, errors or allowances. In respect of the previously issued invoice, a Credit Memo will reduce or eliminate the amount the buyer has to pay. ''Note:'' A Credit Memo is not to be substituted as a formal document. The Credit Memo rarely contains: PO #, Date, Billing Address, Shipping Address, Terms of Payment, List of products with quantities and prices. Usually it references the original Invoice and sometimes states the reason for issue.

This is received if the goods are incomplete, damaged, or not as per specification; customers may also receive one if they paid too much money, or if they had been overcharged.

== Uses ==

* To allow the buyer to purchase an item or service from that seller on a future date, i.e. a [[gift card]] or store card credit. Credit notes may be issued by a seller as a goodwill gesture to a buyer who wishes to return previously purchased merchandise (instead of cash repayment) in circumstances where the original sales agreement did not include an explicit refund policy for returned items. In such circumstances, a credit note of value equal to the price of the returned item is usually issued allowing the buyer to exchange his purchase for other items available with the sale.

'''Eddie Hertzberger''' (17 October 1904 &amp;ndash; 2 May 1993) was a wealthy [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[industrialist]] and [[racecar]] driver. He won the [[1936 Grand Prix season|1936]] [[Grand Prix des Frontières|Frontières]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] for [[sports cars]] at [[Chimay]], [[Belgium]], and the [[1937 Grand Prix season|1937]] [[Voiturette]] race at the same event. He also competed in the [[1935 24 Hours of Le Mans|1935]] and [[1937 24 Hours of Le Mans|1937]] [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] races. In the twenties Hertzberger also did some [[boxing]], while he did a lot of [[sailing]] and [[skiing]] throughout his life.

Hertzberger owned cars like a [[Bugatti]] Type 57 Stelvio 4-seater, with which he participated in the 12-hour night drive organised by the KNAC (Royal Dutch Automobile Club) in September 1926, the [[MG Magnette|MG Magnette K3]], a 4.5 litre [[Bentley]] and an [[Aston Martin]]. He restricted his racing to [[England]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]], with [[motor racing]] in [[the Netherlands]] virtually non-existent, and [[Jew]]s not allowed to participate in motor racing in [[Nazi Germany]].

At [[Monthléry]], Hertzberger managed to break some speed records in his K3. He also started in the [[Mille Miglia]] and at [[Le Mans]]. He quit racing in 1938 after getting married, although he made a surprise appearance at [[Zandvoort]] in 1953.

Hertzberger was the first of only two Dutch racing drivers to win races titled '[[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]]', the other being [[Carel Godin de Beaufort]], until [[Max Verstappen]] won the [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|2016 Spanish]] [[Formula One]] [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]]

== Personal life ==

Hertzberger owned a successful clothing factory in Rotterdam. The factory, including his Bugatti Stelvio #57519 which was parked inside, was completely destroyed at the outbreak of [[World War II]] during the [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombardment of Rotterdam]] that prompted the surrender of Holland to the Nazis. Hertzberger escaped the Netherlands through Belgium and France to [[Switzerland]], where he stayed for more than a year. Later he travelled through [[Vichy France]] to reach [[Spain]]. In [[Madrid]] Hertzberger became a member of the intelligence service of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, which was based in [[London]] during World War II.

After the war, Hertzberger rebuilt his factory and lived both in the Netherlands and [[New York City]]. Later he moved to Switzerland, where he died in 1993.

His wife, [[Eleonore Hertzberger-Katz]] (born 1917), wrote a book about their hazardous journeys, which was reprinted in Dutch in June 2003.

Eddie Hertzberger's [[granddaughter]] [[Gwendolyn Hertzberger|Gwendolyn]] also races. She currently competes in [[Formula Renault]].

In November 2017, Marinakis received the [[Lloyd's List|Lloyd’s List]] "Greek Shipping Personality of the Year" Award at a special ceremony in Athens. Nigel Lowry of Lloyd’s List said Marinakis was the "outstanding candidate" for the award and noted his $1 billion investment in fleet capacity in 2017, his "dynamic dealmaking" in the shipping sector, as well as a range of other activities across philanthropy, sports and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-844573|title=Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis the 'outstanding candidate' for special award|last=|first=|date=28 November 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political career ===
In May 2014, Marinakis was elected first member of the Piraeus city council with the ''Piraeus Winner'' independent ticket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pireasnet.gr/%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%99%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9A%CE%97%CE%A3%CE%95%CE%A5%CE%91%CE%93%CE%93%CE%95%CE%9B%CE%9F%CE%A3MARINAKISEVANGELOS/tabid/1400/Default.aspx|title=LOCAL COUNCILLOR - EVANGELOS M. MARINAKIS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MUNICIPALITY OF PIRAEUS OFFICIAL WEBSITE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he co-founded with [[Yannis Moralis (politician)|Yannis Moralis]], vice-president of [[Olympiacos F.C.]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/23/greece-vote-port-idUSL6N0O53BD20140523|title = Shipping tycoon makes rare political foray in Greek port town|date = 23 May 2014|accessdate = |website = Reuters|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among their pledges were the preservation of the public nature of [[Piraeus]] Port Authority and the development of Piraeus as Europe’s largest cruise ship destination and home port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moralis : "Our problem is that shipowners left from Piraeus"|url=http://en.protothema.gr/moralis-our-problem-is-that-shipowners-left-from-piraeus/|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the elections, his political opponent, Vassilis Michaloliakos, claimed Marinakis was related with the far right political party [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] and accused him for its financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Dawn’s consolidation and its reluctant prosecution|url=http://roarmag.org/2015/02/greece-golden-dawn-prosecution/|publisher=roarmag.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinakis rejected these accusations stating "I condemn Golden Dawn's criminal activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piraeus mayor accuses opponent of deal with Golden Dawn|url=http://www.enetenglish.gr/?i=news.en.article&amp;id=1951|publisher=enetenglish.gr|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election, ''[[Reuters]]'' declared that "rarely has big business mingled so openly with politics in a country where contacts between the two are usually conducted behind the scenes".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Marinakis responded, in a [[TradeWinds (newspaper)|Tradewinds]] interview, that he can see no reason why someone with a strong record in business cannot get into politics, "calling that stance "Palaiolithic logic". "I am not afraid to be involved in politics, because I have no business with the Greek state" he said. Since the elections, he undertook the construction of squares, parks, children’s playgrounds and sports facilities, at his own cost, as the municipality of Piraeus lacks the necessary funds due to the economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/TWplus/355684/marinakis-the-man-behind-the-legend|title=Marinakis.

===Sports===
Since mid-2010 Marinakis has owned [[Piraeus]]' hometown team [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], and serves as its President.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.olympiacos.org/en/member/1634/evangelos-marinakis][[Olympiacos]]&lt;span&gt; website official biography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Marinakis served as president of the [[Superleague Greece]] and vice-president of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] (HFF) from August 2010 until September 2011. During his presidency of Olympiacos, the team won the Greek League title for seven consecutive seasons from 2010–11 to 2016–17, and the National Cup for the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons.

In May 2017, it was announced that Marinakis had completed a transaction to become the majority shareholder in English Championship club and former double European Cup winners [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/nottingham-forest-football-club-press-release-3719464.aspx|title=Nottingham Forest Football Club have released the following statement regarding the take-over by Mr Evangelos M. Marinakis|last=NFFC|access-date=18 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Nottingham Post]]'' noted that Marinakis’ acquisition of the club heralds “an exciting future that gives genuine reason for optimism”. Meanwhile, manager [[Mark Warburton]] commented that he expects Marinakis and his team to be ambitious for Nottingham Forest. “..they are aware of the club's stature and they are good football people,” Warburton was quoted as saying. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/nottingham-forest-talking-point-fine-lines-mean-so-much-as-evangelos-marinakis-plans-new-era/story-30335904-detail/story.html|title=Fine lines mean so much as Evangelos Marinakis plans new era|date=17 May 2017|work=Nottingham Post|access-date=18 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forest.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=581453#ixzz4hQRYlus0|title=Warburton Expecting Aggressive Marinakis Ambitions {{!}} VitalFootball.co.uk|last=Ltd|first=Vitalnetwork|work=VitalFootball.co.uk|access-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
In September 2016, Marinakis, through his company Alter Ego Media S.A., won one of four national television licenses auctioned in Greece after spending EUR 73.9m ($82.8m) in a highly unusual competitive bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/775802/marinakis-wins-greek-tv-licence|title=Marinakis wins Greek TV licence|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Tradewinds News|access-date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license was however revoked on 26 October 2016 since the [[Council of State (Greece)| Greek Council of State]] held that the TV license law of [[Minister of State]] [[Nikos Pappas (politician)|Nikos Pappas]] was unconstitutional.

In July 2017, Alter Ego was confirmed by a Greek first-instance court as the acquirer of the [[Lambrakis Press Group]] (DOL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/07/25/greek-court-confirms-transfer-of-lambrakis-media-group-to-vangelis-marinakis/|title=Greek Court Confirms Transfer of Lambrakis Media Group to Vangelis Marinakis - GreekReporter.com|author=|date=|website=greece.greekreporter.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court approval for the transfer ownership of DOL to Alter Ego followed the latter’s success as the highest bidder in an auction process held earlier in 2017. The court ratified the sale and granted a request by DOL staff that the auction procedure be accepted as valid. The completion of the transfer of ownership was also supported by trade unions representing DOL staff. DOL is one of Greece’s historic major media groups and includes the top selling [[Ta Nea]] and [[To Vima]] newspapers, two of the country's oldest dailies, as well as a popular news portal, magazines and radio station. As of March 2018 the agreement for DOL has not yet been approved by the Competition Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprusnews.eu/tvxs-epistimi/7297995-%CE%B5%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%AF%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BB-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7.html|title=Εμπλοκή στη μεταβίβαση του ΔΟΛ στον Μαρινάκη|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=cyprusnews.eu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds a 22% stake in [[Mega Channel]] TV station. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/25/c_136469236.htm|title=Greek shipowner Marinakis acquires media group DOL - Xinhua - English.news.cn|author=|date=|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2011, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos in [[Karaiskaki Stadium]] (2–1), after a controversial, regarding the referee's decisions, game.

Marinakis stated that he went to the referee’s locker room at halftime only to wish match officials "good luck". Olympiacos went on and won the match 3–1, after a tense 1–1 at halftime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65820/The-alleged-corruption-of-Evangelos-Marinakis-and-the-press-that-refuses-to-report-on-it|title = The alleged corruption of Evangelos Marinakis and the press that refuses to report on it|date = |accessdate = |website = The Press Project|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Marinakis was also acquitted by the Three Members Court of Appeals for the same case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/blog/broken-promises-the-sad-tale-of-greek-football/|title = Broken promises – the sad tale of Greek football|date = 2 October 2014|accessdate = |website = Epoch Times|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another investigation which led to the [[2015 Greek football scandal]], started in 2014 after [[prosecutor]] Aristidis Koreas was given the go-ahead by a council of judges&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_08/07/2014_541220|title = Probe into Greek soccer corruption gathers pace|date = 8 July 2014|accessdate = |website = Ekathimerini|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to make use of secretly recorded phone conversations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13914118|title = Dozens named in Greece football 'scandal'|date = 25 June 2011|accessdate = |website = BBC News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that point to the involvement of various sports officials, including Evangelos Marinakis. According to Koreas, "the president of Olympiakos and close associates approached and tried to use policemen, judges, politicians and other powerful figures for their own ends as part of the planning and establishment of a criminal organization".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to the prosecutor, Marinakis was helped by the President of the Greek Football Association, Giorgos Sarris, to choose specific referees to oversee key games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marinakis denies fixing|url=http://www.thepressproject.net/article/65820/The-alleged-corruption-of-Evangelos-Marinakis-and-the-press-that-refuses-to-report-on-it|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=ThePressProject&lt;!--, 09:31 GMT--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has repeatedly denied all charges:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marinakis denies fixing|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/andalso/article147701.ece5|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=Tradewinds|date=27 June 2011&lt;!--, 09:31 GMT--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These allegations have nothing to do with me and have no effect on me whatsoever," Marinakis said.

===Drug trafficking===
In March 2018, Marinakis was charged with trafficking heroin by [[prosecutor|public prosecutor]] Irene Tziva. The accusations against Marinakis were described as "very serious charges" following a three-year investigation after the tanker Noor One was intercepted at the Greek port of [[Piraeus]] carrying 2.1 tonnes of heroin in 2014. He has also been charged with financing an illegal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43527262|title=Evangelos Marinakis: Nottingham Forest owner rejects drugs link|author=|date=24 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nottingham Forest F.C. chairman Nicholas Randall wrote an open letter to supporters reaffirming his support for Evangelos Marinakis. Randall confirmed the matter was under investigation but that "there is no ‘charge’ against Marinakis and no ‘prosecution’ is in process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No drug charge for Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-drug-charge-for-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis-gmw2fk6l0|website=The Times|accessdate=18 May 2018|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2046">The '''Further and Higher Education Act 1992''' made changes in the funding and administration of [[further education]] and [[higher education]] within [[England and Wales]] with consequential effects on associated matters in Scotland which had previously been governed by the same legislation as England and Wales. It was introduced during the [[First Major ministry]].

The most visible result was to allow thirty-five [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]]s to become [[university|universities]] (often referred to as the "[[new universities (United Kingdom)|new universities]]" or "post-1992 universities"). In addition the Act created bodies to fund higher education in England—[[HEFCE]]—and further education—[[Further Education Funding Council for England|FEFC]]. Universities in Scotland and Wales which had previously been funded by one UK-wide [[Universities Funding Council]] were the subject of other Acts that created higher education funding councils in each country. The act abolished binary line, created national unitary funding councils, removed colleges of further education from local government control, and created quality assessment arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=104836&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Richards, Huw, "The collision of two worlds", '&amp;#39;Times Higher Education'&amp;#39; (December 5, 1997) |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=1997-12-05 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Industry Social Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro''' comprehends SESI's work in [[Rio de Janeiro state]]. The institution focuses in bettering [[workplace|work environment]], [[quality of life]] and [[education]] level of [[Collaboration|collaborators]] from Rio de Janeiro's enterprises. Through programs and mobile units, it carries out actions related to [[health]], education, [[sports]], [[leisure]], [[culture]], [[occupational health]], [[work safety]] and [[environmental protection]]. These activities are aimed at workers and companies, as much as to [[society]] in general. SENAI Rio's history is parallel to the Brazilian industrial development and its designation accompanies Rio de Janeiro's changes, as when it became a capital and was renamed [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara state]].

== Programs ==

Due to its social function, SESI Rio focuses on two specific pillars in the state: education and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firjan.org.br/data/pages/40288094212F79010121314833326D3B.htm|title=SESI: ultrapassando os muros da indústria|accessdate=21 January 2014|website=Sistema FIRJAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firjan.org.br/data/pages/2C908CE9229431C901229F14298918C3.htm|title=Projeto Transformar|accessdate=7 March 2014|website=Sistema FIRJAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile units ==

The mobile units are trailers and vans with office structure to take up to companies health care for employees. Units can be [[dentistry|dental]], [[occupational health]] and [[x-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celi.com.br/noticias/leitura/id/840/A_saude_do_colaborador_em_primeiro_lugar|title=A saúde do colaborador em primeiro lugar|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=16 July 2009|website=Construtora Celi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Until the early 1940s, Brazil was an agricultural, rural and dependent on imported manufactured goods economy. Gradually the industrial sector was being equipped, but it was still difficult to meet all the needs of the worker. Further during the [[Second World War]]. Then, in 1946 (post-war), the private sector exercised its social function and created SESI.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/1937-1946/Del9403.htm Decreto-Lei n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 9.403, from 25 June 1946], whereby the president of the Brazilian republic ([[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]) gave "the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) the mission to create, organize and direct the Industry Social Service".&lt;/ref&gt; It was industry [[legitimizing]] [[social service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebah.com.br/content/ABAAAAoUwAG/servico-social-na-sociedade-capitalista|title=O serviço social na sociedade capitalista|accessdate=30 May 2014|website=Ebah}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same date, its National Department formed the Regional Division of Rio de Janeiro. It was "the beginning of Brazilian industrialization and a new cycle of development that sought to guarantee the country a place in the new international environment."&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt;

=== Industrialization ===
Between the 50s and the 70s the [[economy]] has changed, with the goal of building an industrialized and competitive society. In 1953, Rio de Janeiro's Regional Division becomes the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District's]] Regional Department, with [[jurisdiction]] on the federal capital. But when the Federal District is transferred to [[Brasília]] and Guanabara State is created, in 1960, it receives the name of Guanabara State's Regional Department. It turns out that, in 1974, then-President [[Ernesto Geisel]] decided to merge the states of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro (preserving the name of the latter), returning to Rio its ''status'' of the state capital. It is precisely in this time of transition, between 1974 and 1979, that it is created the Regional Department of the State of Rio de Janeiro, current SESI Rio.

=== The so called "lost decade” ===
During the 80s, dubbed "[[La Década Perdida|the lost decade]]" by economists, SESI Rio "increased in 328% the number of its services in the areas of Food, Entertainment, Health, Education, Service and Community Actions, ie, from 4.2 million to 18 million people."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Beloch|first1=I.|last2=Fagundes|first2=L. R.|title=Sistema Firjan: a história dos 170 anos da representação industrial no Rio de Janeiro, 1827-1997|publisher=Memória Brasil Projetos Culturais Ltda.|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From 1980 to 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1990s ===
In the 90s, the policy of expanding through the interior has been strengthened with the installation of units in approximately 10 municipalities.

=== The 2000s ===
In the 2000s the focus has changed to:
* Expertise in Corporate Social Responsibility, with focus on hearing the demands of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (e.g. [[employees]], [[consumers]], community, government and environment);
* Creation of a network of alliances between similar entities;
* Increase in the number of Mobile Units;
* Appreciation of the sport (as leisure and [[social inclusion]]) through championships;
* Creation of [[Distance education|distance learning]] courses for personal qualification.

In recent years, SESI Rio has sought to strengthen its programs for the welfare and quality of life of the citizens of Rio de Janeiro state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cursogratisonline.com.br/sesi-rj-cursos-e-inscricoes/|title=O SESI do Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN)|accessdate=1 July 2014|website=Cursos Gratuitos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atelrj.org/home/convenios-educacao-1/sesi-rj|title=SESI-RJ|accessdate=1 July 2014|website=Associação dos Técnicos Industriais no Estado do Rio de Janeiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kadugodi''' ({{IPA-kn|Kāḍugōḍi}}), also known as '''Kadugudi'''  was founded by the great [[Cholas Dynasty]]. It is located in [[Whitefield, Bangalore|Whitefield]], [[Bangalore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]]. Kadugodi comes from "kadu" &amp; "Gudi" meaning "temple in a forest" in [[Kannada]]. It is believed that this whole area had thick vegetation consisting of soap-nut shrubs. The temple after which the place gets its name was also discovered by people venturing in to this kadu(forest) while gathering soap-nuts. This temple is of Anjaneya which is believed as udbhava murthi. Kadugudi is also referred to as "Aranayapuri" in temple related invites and publications.

Kadugodi has many temples and oldest among them are Anjaneya temple, kashi Vishwanatha temple, Ganesh temple, Eashwara temple and the grama devata temples of Maramma and Ganga parameshwari. All these temples are located in old kadugodi area starting from Bapuji circle up to Kashi vishwanatha temple.

Two major festivities of kadugudi is when Rathotsava(Charriot festival) are conducted for Eashwara and Rama deities. Lot of festivities are conducted before and after the actual rathotsava day.

Going by the street names of kadugudi one can deduce that this place must have been a well planned out settlement. There is a kumbhara beedi(potter street), there is Ganigara beedi(vegetable oil extractors), Angadi beedi(Market street), balajigara beedhi(mainly merchants dealing in bangles, flowers etc.).

In 1970s kadugodi saw its first extension towards west as Village Panchyat extension or simple referred to as new extension or VP extension. In 1980s saw another extension in eastern direction when a new extension was formed by free distribution of plots to economically deserving families. This was done by the Eashwara temple family and was named after Shree Shankar Dixit, this area now is popularly known as Shankara pura.

{{Japanese name|Matsukata}}
{{nihongo|'''Matsukata Kōjirō'''|松方 幸次郎||extra=January 17, 1865 &amp;ndash; June 24, 1950}} was a Japanese businessman who devoted his life and fortune to amassing a collection of Western art which, he hoped, would become the nucleus of a Japanese national museum focused particularly on masterworks of the Western art tradition.  Although his plans were not realized in his lifetime, his vision is commemorated in Japan's [[National Museum of Western Art]] ([[National Museum of Western Art|NMWA]]) in Ueno, central Tokyo.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"&gt;[http://www.nmwa.go.jp/en/collection/index.html  NMWA collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsukata was the third son of the early [[Meiji period]] [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]] and ''[[genrō]]'', [[Matsukata Masayoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1923/09/04/archives/article-4-no-title.html?sq=matsukata+kojiro&amp;scp=17&amp;st=p "Article 4 -- No Title,"] ''The New York Times''. September 4, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;  While at [[Rutgers College]], he was a member of the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity and a member of the freshman football team.  After being educated in the United States at [[Rutgers Preparatory School]] and [[Rutgers University]], he became  president of [[Kawasaki Shōzō|Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company]] (''Kawasaki Shōzō'') in 1896 and then went on to become&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Liah. (2001).

The financial success he enjoyed in the early part of the century was affected adversely by economic downturns in the 1920s and 1930s; but much of his art collection remained intact despite the collapse of his business interests.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;

== Art collecting ==
{{see also|ja:松方コレクション}}
Masukata invested his significant personal fortune in the acquisition of several thousand examples of Western painting, sculpture and decorative arts. He collected these art works throughout Europe, but primarily in Paris.  Mutsukata bought the Rodin masterpiece, "Gates of Hell", which is currently to be seen at the Rodin Museum in Paris; and the sculptures on display in the NMWA entrance plaza were made from the same original molds.&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Clara. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A11FC3C5F17738DDDAB0A94D0405B868EF1D3&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=matsukata+kojiro&amp;st=p  "Rodin's Tomb a New Meca for Artists of the World; Sculptures Reassembled at Meudon Will Be Opened to Public -- Their Setting Is Beautiful and Impressive",] ''The New York Times''. August 22, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, he hoped to see his collections in an art museum in Tokyo where visitors could come into direct contact with Western art;&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt; and he wanted the people of Tokyo to enjoy the same degree of easy access to great art which was available to Parisians.

Matsukata is also famous for his collection of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock prints which had been scattered throughout the world.  The 1925 exhibition of the woodblock prints Mtsukata collected abroad is thought to have been the first of its kind in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Checkland, Olive. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=VPpTfAK9oKwC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Matsukata+Kojiro&amp;sig=wTPz7JtVPhTFV_RqLnnYBzkBXP4#PPA107,M1 ''Japan and Britain After 1859: Creating Cultural Bridges'', p. 107.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today about 8,000 ukiyo-e prints from the Matsukata collection are housed in the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;

Among these works collected by Matsukata, those known today as the NMWA Matsukata Collection remained in France after World War II; and as part of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, they were briefly confiscated by France. Although most were sent to Japan, 14 valuable paintings by Monet, Van Gogh, Courbet, Cézanne, and others were retained to fill in gaps in the French national collection.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"&gt;Falk, Ray.  [https://www.nytimes.com/1959/06/21/archives/french-art-in-tokyo.html?sq=matsukata+kojiro&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p  "French Art in Tokyo",] ''The New York Times''. June 21, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining objects in the Matsukata collection totaled 370 works, including 196 paintings, 80 drawings, 26 prints and 63 sculptures—including massive public statuary by Rodin which now grace the landscaped area in front of the entrance to NMWA.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;  Each of the Rodin sculptures in the NMWA collection were cast from the original molds.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"/&gt;  In fact, as it happens, Matsukata was the one who paid for the best Rodin castings in France today, but he didn't quite manage to bring them back to Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Michener, James A. (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=EWH3P_CuEPsC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Matsukata+Kojiro&amp;sig=S8Ve5bK47fxCDcxEypcsIRp0HcE#PPA246,M1  ''The Floating World'', p. 244.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is how they fell into French hands at the end of World War II. The Matsukata Collection is in Tokyo today because France eventually gave these artworks to the Japanese people.&lt;ref name="NMWAcollection2"/&gt;

Matsukata was well known as a good friend of Claude Monet. It has been reported that once, when Monet offered him the opportunity to buy whatever he wanted in the studio at Giverny, he purchased 18 paintings.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"/&gt;  His other artist friends included [[Frank Brangwyn]], who assisted Matsukata in the acquisition of his collection.  Brangwyn designed a gallery, the so-called Palace of Sheer Pleasure, which Matsukata intended to build in Tokyo.

He had originally intended to bring all these artworks to Japan, but he balked at the 100% tax imposed on imports.  Much of what was stored in Britain was destroyed by fires during World War II; and much of what remained in Japan was also destroyed by Allied bombing during the Pacific War.  The combination of factors which kept so much of his collecting activities intact was only seen by the Japanese public for the first time in 1959 when they visited the museum he had envisaged.&lt;ref name="nyt1959"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">In the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], the '''Ladenschlussgesetz''' or "Shop Closing Law" (abbreviated: '''LadSchlG''') is the federal law regulating at which times retail stores were forced to be closed to the public. The ''Ladenschlussgesetz'' in its current form was first enacted on 28 November 1956 following pressure from Germany's trade unions; in its last revision (of 2 June 2003), points of sale ''(Verkaufsstellen)'' must be closed at any of the following times:

# On Sundays and public [[holiday]]s;
# On working days (Monday through Saturday) before 06:00 and after 20:00;
# On December 24 before 06:00 and after 14:00 if that date falls on a working day

The law provides differing regulations for pharmacies, petrol stations, shops at train stations and airports, etc. 

On 30 June 2006, as part of the ''Föderalismusreform'' ("Federalism Reform"), the regulatory responsibility for this area was devolved to the [[States of Germany|German states]].  The net effect, although the Federal law technically remains in force, the states are free to determine the opening hours of retail stores in their areas. Meanwhile, all states - with the exception of the more conservative Bavaria - made use of that option.

==German states with varying shop opening hours==
The states have each adopted individual regulations concerning opening hours on Sundays and public holidays.  Some continue to observe the existing Federal rules, while others have liberalized them somewhat, although the general Federal ban concerning opening on Sundays and holidays remains in effect, owing to a provision in the German constitution recognizing Sunday as a day of rest and a corresponding decision of the Federal Constitutional Court ''([[Bundesverfassungsgericht]])'' on 9 June 2004.

As part of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], various [[Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016#Economists|economists]] and [[List_of_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign_primary_endorsements,_2016#Businesspeople|businesspeople]] have served both in a formal and an informal capacity, to advise Trump on [[macroeconomics]] and associated [[government policy]] decisions.  During the [[presidential transition of Donald Trump#Transition_team|transition]] to the [[Presidency of Donald Trump#Personnel|presidency]], Trump gained additional advisors, and after the [[inauguration of Donald Trump#Committee_members|inauguration]] some of his advisors will officially become part of the [[Political appointments of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] (including the [[United States National Economic Council|NEC]], [[National Trade Council|NTC]], [[Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States#Donald_Trump|advisors]], [[List_of_U.S._executive_branch_czars#List_of_executive_branch_czars|czars]], [[Counselor to the President|counselors]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Director of the Office of Management and Budget|OMB]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers|CEA]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Secretary of Commerce|Commerce]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#United States Trade Representative|USTR]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Administrator of the Small Business Administration|SBA]], [[Political appointments of Donald Trump#Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], and the [[Political appointments of Donald Trump#Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve|Fed]]) while others will remain in the [[private sector]] as informal advisors with varying degrees of influence.

==During his presidential campaign==
{{main|Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016}}
Trump released initial details of his economic policies when his campaign officially began in June 2015, and more details during the first [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican debates]] which began in August 2015.  Although critical of certain aspects of Trump's early economic plans, especially increasing [[tariff]]s as opposed to [[free trade]] policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/08/26/donald_trump_a_21st_century_protectionist_herbert_hoover_127893.html|title=Donald Trump: A 21st Century Protectionist Herbert Hoover - RealClearPolitics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Kudlow]] and [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Steve Moore]] would eventually{{when|date=December 2016}} agree to join the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] as advisors.  Although most presidential candidates had announced a team of formal economic advisors by October 2015, at the time Trump still primarily relied upon [[Donald Trump#Business career|his business background]] to inform his economic plan ([[Carly Fiorina]] was the other candidate who relied primarily upon her own background in business in the early phases of the campaign).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/257277-the-economic-advisers-behind-the-candidates|title=The economic advisers behind the candidates|first=Mark Bloomfield,|last=contributor|date=19 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his own business expertise, Trump had a network of contacts that sometimes served as informal economic advisors during his campaign, including [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/11/21/donald-trump-carl-ichan-role/|title=Billionaire Carl Icahn Is Considering an Official Economics Role under Donald Trump|first=Lucinda|last=Shen|website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even as late as July 2016, however, [[Larry Kudlow|Kudlow]] and [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Moore]] were still not official advisors, despite having already helped craft some of Trump's policy-positions related to taxation for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/what-trumps-and-clintons-economic-advisors-can-tell-you-about-the-candidates.html|title=What Trump's and Clinton's economic advisors can tell you about the candidates|first=Ivan|last=Levingston|date=22 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the general election===
Trump released a list of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his campaign's]] official economic advisers in August 2016,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/business/economy/donald-trump-economic-team.html|title=Trump’s Economic Team: Bankers and Billionaires (and All Men)|first=Patricia|last=Cohen|date=5 August 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-announces-trump-economic-advisory-council|title=Trump Campaign Announces Economic Advisory Council|publisher=Donald J.

The Trump'16 finance director [[Steven Mnuchin]] was also listed, and played a role in helping coordinate the group.  Many of the names on the original list, or on the subsequent expansions thereof,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-economic-advisers-revised-list-226912|title=Trump brings women on to his economic council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; received media attention [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|as potential appointees]] to the presidential [[Council of Economic Advisers]], or in [[Political_appointments_of_Donald_Trump|other Trump administration roles]].

==As the [[President-elect]]==
{{main|Cabinet of Donald Trump|Political appointments of Donald Trump}}

As of December 2016, many of the advisors during the campaign listed above are under consideration for [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|cabinet-level roles]] or other [[Political appointments of Donald Trump|high-level roles]] in the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].  (For instance, Navarro is a contender for the [[Council_of_Economic_Advisers#List_of_Chairs|CEA]] chair, and Shelton is a contender for [[Political_appointments_of_Donald_Trump#Vice_Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve|Fed Vice-Chair]].)  

===Informal presidential advisors=== 
In addition to his statutory advisory groups, Trump is also organizing efforts to directly communicate with business leaders.

The details of the December 2016 meeting were not made public, but according to anonymous sources, reforming the [[H1B visa]] program was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-immigration-tech-idUSKBN14W1CZ|title=Trump, tech tycoons talk overhaul of H1B visas|date=12 January 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSC Software Corporation''' is an American [[software]] company based in [[Newport Beach, California]], that specializes in [[Computer simulation|simulation]] software.

In February 2017, the company was acquired by [[Sweden|Swedish]] technology company [[Hexagon AB]] for $834 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/deals-day-idUSL4N1FN2KN Reuters Deals&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MSC Software Corporation was formed in 1963 under the name MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC), by Dr Richard H. MacNeal and Robert Schwendler.  The company developed its first structural analysis software called SADSAM (Structural Analysis by Digital Simulation of Analog Methods) at that time, and was deeply involved in the early efforts of the aerospace industry to improve early finite element analysis technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mscsoftware.com/msc-software |title=MSC Software Company History |publisher=MSC Software Corporation |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key milestone was responding to a 1965 [[request for proposal]] (RFP) from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) for a general purpose structural analysis program that would eventually become [[Nastran]] (NASA Structural Analysis).  The company subsequently pioneered many of the technologies that are now relied upon by industry to analyze and predict stress and strain, vibration and dynamics, acoustics, and thermal analysis.  In 1971, the company released a commercial version of Nastran, named MSC/Nastran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-MacNealSchwendler-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=History of The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation |publisher=FundingUniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after MSC began marketing MSC/Nastran, the company established its first overseas office in [[Munich, Germany]]. Three years after entering Europe, MSC moved eastward and opened an office in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. In 1983, MSC made its debut as a public company, and a year later the stock migrated to the [[American Stock Exchange]]. The company expanded in 1992 by adding a subsidiary in [[Moscow, Russia]]. In 1995, it further expanded its growth by adding an office in Brazil.  In June 1999, MSC's stockholders voted to change the company's name to MSC.Software Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mscsoftware.com/press/press.cfm?pid=444&amp;div_id=1&amp;non=1&amp;arc=1&amp;yid=1999 |title=The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation Changes Name to MSC.Software Corporation |publisher=MSC Software Corporation |date=1999-06-23 |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, MSC Software was acquired by the [[private equity firm]] [[Symphony Technology Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven M. Davidoff |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/small-deals-big-issues/ |title=Small Deals, Big Issues |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "dot" was dropped from the company's name in 2011 and the company's name is currently MSC Software Corporation.

The company is headquartered in [[Newport Beach, California]] and employs approximately 1,300 people in 23 countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  2016 revenue was USD$230 million.  In February 2017, the company was acquired by Swedish engineering services conglomerate Hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfxspeak.com/2017/02/02/hexagon-acquire-software/ |title=Hexagon to acquire MSC Software for $834 million |website=gfxspeak.com |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention is for ownership to transfer to the [[private sector]] in due course.&lt;ref name="Asia's arbitration explosion"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowe|first1=Chris|title=Asia's arbitration explosion|date=16 August 2010|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleUid=C55383E1-519F-4CD9-8822-BE34CC748D2F|website=International Bar Association|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]] announced that it was planning to expand the current size of Maxwell Chambers with [[#Maxwell Chambers Suites|Maxwell Chambers Suites]] in a bid to boost Singapore's position as an international dispute resolution hub.&lt;ref name=MC1&gt;{{cite web|title=Maxwell Chambers to expand, will take over building that houses Red Dot Design Museum|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/maxwell-chambers-to-expand-will-take-over-building-that-houses-red-dot-design|website=The Straits Times|publisher=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origins of Maxwell Chambers can be traced as far back as 2002 when the Legal Services Working Group of the Economic Review Committee chaired by then Deputy Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] stressed the need for “good infrastructure and facilities” to make Singapore a regional alternative dispute resolution service centre.&lt;ref name="The Asia Pacific Arbitration Review 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=Jawad|last2=Yeap|first2=Andre|title=Section 2: Overviews - Arbitration in Asia|journal=The Asia Pacific Arbitration Review 2014|url=http://globalarbitrationreview.com/reviews/55/sections/193/chapters/2165/arbitration-asia/|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]] started planning for the development of an integrated dispute resolution complex. The architects visited arbitration hearing centres around the world to get design ideas, and then added “a Singapore touch”.&lt;ref name="Maxwell Chambers opens in Singapore"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sulaiman|first1=Uzma Balkiss|title=Maxwell Chambers opens in Singapore|journal=Global Arbitration Review|date=7 February 2010|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://globalarbitrationreview.com/journal/article/27663/maxwell-chambers-opens-singapore}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Singapore's former Custom House was chosen as the site&lt;ref name="Asia's arbitration explosion" /&gt; and design work commenced.  Upon the completion of refurbishment works in July 2009, the building opened for hearings.

Maxwell Chambers was officially launched in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Maxwell Chambers opens in Singapore" /&gt;

==Reception==

The establishment of Maxwell Chambers was nominated by Global Arbitration Review (GAR) as one of the “Best Developments” in the arbitration industry in 2010.&lt;ref name="Singapore: City state reflects on progress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Alison|title=Singapore: City state reflects on progress|journal=Global Arbitration Review|date=5 June 2011|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://globalarbitrationreview.com/journal/article/29602/singapore-city-state-reflects-progress}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GAR's first survey on hearing centres in 2013 found that Maxwell Chambers was one of the top three hearing centres that leading international arbitration lawyers were most likely to "recommend to a friend". Survey respondents remarked that Maxwell Chambers was “perfect”, “the standout facility” and “currently the gold standard”.&lt;ref name="Hearing Centres Survey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samuels|first1=David|title=Hearing Centres Survey|journal=Global Arbitration Review's Guide to Regional Arbitration|date=4 February 2014|volume=2|url=http://globalarbitrationreview.com/regional-arbitration/directory/4/article/32364/hearing-centres-survey/|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In GAR's Hearing Centres Survey for 2016, Maxwell Chambers was ranked second for most of the key factors respondents look out for in choosing a hearing centre, such as location, IT services, and helpfulness of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide To Regional Arbitration (volume 4 - 2016)|url=http://globalarbitrationreview.com/edition/1000140/guide-to-regional-arbitration-volume-4-2016|website=Global Arbitration Review|publisher=Global Arbitration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

Maxwell Chambers occupies the former Custom House located in [[Tanjong Pagar]] in Singapore's central business district. Built in the 1930s during the British colonial era, the building was the headquarters of the [[Singapore Customs|Department of Customs and Excise]] for over 60 years.&lt;ref name="The Building that Never Slept"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Building that Never Slept|journal=inSYNC - Singapore Customs Newsletter|date=January 2011|issue=10|url=http://www.customs.gov.sg/insync/issue10/thebuildingthatneverslept.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the refurbishment of the building, it was renamed Maxwell Chambers and was in 2010 marked the 88th historic site in Singapore by the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]].&lt;ref name="Custom House marked as a historic site"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spykerman|first1=Kimberly|title=Custom House marked as a historic site|agency=The Straits Times|date=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was awarded the International Architecture Award for Best New Global Design (2010) by The Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design and the European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.&lt;ref name="The International Architectural Awards 2010 Archive"&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Architectural Awards 2010 Archive|date=2010|publisher=The Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design|page=62|url=https://chi-athenaeum.org/assets/pdf_archives/intarch/archive-2010-International-Arch-awards.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the building was also awarded an Architectural Heritage Award by Singapore's [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Jeanne|title=Maxwell Chambers wins URA Architectural Heritage Award|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20121005-375805.html|accessdate=4 August 2014|agency=AsiaOne|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxwell Chambers Suites===

The [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]] announced in January 2017 that Maxwell Chambers would triple in capacity by taking over the neighbouring building at 28 Maxwell Road (formerly known as the Red Dot Traffic Building), in order to support the growth of dispute resolution institutions which have seen significant increases in caseload.&lt;ref name=MC1 /&gt;

At the official groundbreaking ceremony in June 2017, the Ministry of Law announced that the new offices at 28 Maxwell Road would be renamed Maxwell Chambers Suites. It was also announced the Suites would be expanding even further due to "strong demand", with a second annexe block to add 3,500 sq ft of space, on top of the 120,000 sq ft expansion that was originally planned.&lt;ref name=MC2&gt;{{cite web|title=Strong demand drives further expansion at Maxwell Chambers|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/strong-demand-drives-further-expansion-at-maxwell-chambers|website=The Business Times|publisher=The Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Maxwell Chambers Suites will provide a new 24-hour public thoroughfare that will allow pedestrian access between [[Tanjong Pagar MRT station]] and the [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]]  area. These two areas are currently separated by the 161-metre long building along Maxwell Road. Maxwell Chambers Suites will also house four floors of about 50 new offices for international dispute resolution institutions, arbitration chambers, law firms and ancillary legal services.

Restoration works are currently underway and expected to be completed in 2019.&lt;ref name=MC2 /&gt;

==Facilities==

Maxwell Chambers has 10 custom-designed and fully equipped hearing rooms and 12 preparation rooms, a business centre,&lt;ref name="New integrated dispute resolution complex opens in Singapore"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeo|first1=Alvin|last2=Maniam|first2=Andre|title=New integrated dispute resolution complex opens in Singapore|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/0-501-4054?service=arbitration|accessdate=4 August 2014|agency=Practical Law|date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lounge for arbitrators.&lt;ref name="Maxwell Chambers opens in Singapore" /&gt; It also provides audio-visual and [[Videoconferencing|video conferencing]] facilities and [[Language interpretation|simultaneous translation]] and [[Transcription (service)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="New integrated dispute resolution complex opens in Singapore" /&gt;

==Tenants==

Maxwell Chambers houses the regional offices of several ADR institutions&lt;ref name="The Asia Pacific Arbitration Review 2014" /&gt; including the [[Singapore International Arbitration Centre]] (SIAC), the [[Singapore International Mediation Centre]] (SIMC), the [[International Court of Arbitration|ICC Court of Arbitration]], the [[American Arbitration Association]]’s (AAA) International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR), the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) Arbitration and Mediation Center, and the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA).  The Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC) will also be based at Maxwell Chambers.&lt;ref name='Back to "MediAsian"'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=George|title=Back to "MediAsian"|url=http://whoswholegal.com/news/features/article/31678/back-mediasian/|website=Who's Who Legal|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ministère de l'Éducation Nationale - Paris - 2.jpg|thumb|The head office of the ministry]]
The '''Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research''' ({{lang-fr|Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche}}), or simply "Ministry of National Education", as the title has changed no small number of times in the course of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] is the French government [[French government ministers|cabinet member]] charged with running France's public educational system and with the supervision of agreements and authorizations for private teaching organizations.

The Ministry's headquarters is located in the 18th century ''Hôtel de Rochechouart'' on the rue de [[Grenelle]] in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid2606/mentions-legales.html à propos du site - mentions légales - crédits]." Ministry of National Education. Retrieved on 6 May 2011. "Ministère de l’éducation nationale, de la jeunesse et de la vie associative Secrétariat général - Délégation à la communication 110 rue de Grenelle 75007 Paris"&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that National Education is France's largest employer, and employs more than half of the [[French Civil Service|French state civil servants]], the position is traditionally a fairly strategic one. The current minister is [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]].

==History==
A governmental position overseeing public education was first created in [[France]] in 1802.  Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of '''Minister of Public Instruction''' was created in 1828.  For much of its history, the position was combined with that of [[Minister of Public Worship]], who dealt with issues related to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]].  The position has also occasionally been combined with [[Minister of Sports (France)|Minister of Sports]] and Minister of Youth Affairs.  In 1932, the office's title was changed to '''Minister of National Education''', although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed '''Minister of Education''' during the Presidency of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (1974–1981). In 1975, it created the ''[[Comité d'études sur les formations d'ingénieurs]]'' which studies the training and job placement of engineers in France.

==Problems with the law==
Kyriakou owned four acres of land in [[Athens]] that are in violation of Areos Park, as some of the [[Panellinios Athens]] complexes are illegally on the premises of the [[Athens Municipality]] and the [[Athens Prefecture]]. In February 2007, a penalty of 48 months imprisonment without suspension, and a fine of [[Euro sign|€]]15,000 [[euros]] was placed on Kyriakou for the arbitrary construction of a cottage property in San Aimilianos in [[Porto Heli]]. Namely, the construction of a harbor that was in violation of not only the winter tide, but also the future expansion of the coastline. As a result of this, Kyriakou appealed the ruling of the court and he was then asked to pay a fee of €100,000 euros in financial security costs until the appeal trial could be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paron.gr/v3/new.php?id=12473&amp;colid=&amp;catid=28&amp;dt=2007-02-11%200:0:0|title=TO ΠΑΡΟΝ ΤΗΣ ΚΥΡΙΑΚΗΣ|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_2_29/03/2008_264467 News.kathimerini.gr - Εγγύηση Κυριακού μέχρι τη δίκη. {{el icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711110713/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_2_29/03/2008_264467 |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galera.gr/magazine/modules/articles/article.php?id=715|title=Account Suspended|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303025657/http://www.galera.gr/magazine/modules/articles/article.php?id=715|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Authority is responsible for facilitating and regulating the establishment and operation of all private broadcast media and distribution services in Pakistan established for the purpose of international, national, provincial, district, and local or special target audiences.

==History==
The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) was promoted by the government as an open media policy reform and was fortified with strong regulatory teeth. The establishment of PEMRA was initiated in 2000, during President Musharraf's term; through the formation of the Regulatory Authority for Media Broadcast Organisations (RAMBO) which was mandated to improve standards of information, education and entertainment; expand the choice available to the people of Pakistan in the media for news, current affairs, religions knowledge, art, culture, science, technology, economic development, social sector concerns, music, sport, drama and other subjects of public and national interest; facilitate the devolution of responsibility and power to grass roots by improving the access to mass media at the local and community level; and lastly, to ensure accountability, transparency and good governance by optimising the free flow of information.

Many pro-democratic campaigners consider this four-point mandate to be a solid foundation supporting democracy processes and comprehensive media liberalisation. However, the general opinion among media practitioners is that PEMRA only acted as a licence issuing office that has implemented regulatory barriers for broadcasters. "It is a Bhatta (money extortion in [[Urdu]]) body that collects money from broadcasting operators in a legal way. Nothing more can be expected." notes media law activist and journalist Matiullah Jan.

The PEMRA laws were utilized by the [[Pervez Musharraf|Musharraf]] regime in his attempts to tame the media. Some stations were shut down and some were under severe harassments using these laws. The 12-member authority was dominated by bureaucrats and ex-police officers - a phenomenon that had been partly changed after the assumption of office by the present government. However, media activists are still not comfortable with the composition of the 12-member committee where they highlight the need of a greater representation from the media itself. "Regulation of the TV and Radio should be through the participation and representation of the stake holders. What must happen is the restructuring of the Board of PEMRA with independent eminent people. It is still full of bureaucrats and ex-policemen, so there you find lack of ownership." says Maitullah Jan.

PEMRA's leadership agree to that the institution needs to be more engaged with its stakeholders. "It's a combination of regulator and the stakeholders. Therefore, the chain is - Law/Regulator/Stakeholder," says Dr. Abdul Jabbar, the Executive Member of PEMRA.

However, the present government is under pressure to amend or repeal these laws. Many media practitioners confirmed that the harsh use of the PEMRA laws during the Musharraf regime had not occurred during the past years. The PEMRA board has been reconstituted to some extent and includes some media professionals. Furthermore, the government is making some attempts to reintroduce some democratic norms in its media regulation reform.

The Code of Conduct made by PEMRA has been subjected to criticism by the industry players, and is now being reviewed by the government. The former Minister of Information has requested Pakistani Broadcasters Association to draft a new Code of Conduct to replace the existing Code of Conduct of PEMRA.

Still, a somewhat top-down approach is taken from PEMRA authorities on this matter. Referring to the issue of Code of Conduct, Dr. Abdul Jabbar said that presently there are many Codes of Conduct, one by PFUJ, one by South Asia Free Media Association (SAFMA) and the broadcasters are in the process of formulating another. "The Government will not agree to any of these, most probably. But taking all these documents into account, the government will come up with a comprehensive document that can be acceptable to all stakeholders. Then everybody has the ownership." He continued: "PEMRA will function - it will not be silenced or nullified. We will be the regulatory body. But the stakeholders will have a say in the Code of Conduct. That's what we call self-regulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i-m-s.dk/files/publications/1491%20Pakistan.final.web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229205633/http://www.i-m-s.dk/files/publications/1491%20Pakistan.final.web.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pharmacologyprism.jpg|thumb|A variety of topics involved with pharmacology, including [[neuropharmacology]], renal pharmacology, human [[metabolism]], intracellular metabolism, and intracellular regulation]]
'''Pharmacology''' is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of [[drug]] action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vallance P, Smart TG |title=The future of pharmacology |journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |volume=147 Suppl 1 |issue= S1|pages=S304–7 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16402118 |pmc=1760753 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0706454 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within the body) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word [[pharmacon]] is used as a term to encompass these [[endogenous]] and [[exogenous]] [[Biological activity|bioactive]] species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].

The field encompasses drug composition and properties, synthesis and drug design, molecular and cellular [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]], organ/systems mechanisms, signal transduction/cellular communication, molecular diagnostics, [[drug interaction|interaction]]s, [[toxicology]], [[chemical biology]], therapy, and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are [[pharmacodynamics]] and [[pharmacokinetics]]. Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems, and Pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals from the biological systems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with [[pharmacy]] and the two terms are frequently confused. Pharmacology, a biomedical science, deals with the research, discovery, and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals. In contrast, pharmacy, a health services profession, is concerned with application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role. In either field, the primary contrast between the two are their distinctions between direct-patient care, for pharmacy practice, and the science-oriented research field, driven by pharmacology.

The origins of [[clinical pharmacology]] date back to the Middle Ages in [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Commentary on Isaac'', and [[John of St Amand]]'s ''Commentary on the Antedotary of Nicholas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=447–50 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10824622 |doi=10.1067/mcp.2000.106465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical pharmacology owes much of its foundation to the work of [[William Withering]].&lt;ref&gt;Mannfred A. Hollinger (2003)."''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bx-WfLwrVH8C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Introduction to pharmacology]''". [[CRC Press]]. p.4. {{ISBN|0-415-28033-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacology as a scientific discipline did not further advance until the mid-19th century amid the great biomedical resurgence of that period.&lt;ref name=rang2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rang HP |title=The receptor concept: pharmacology's big idea |journal=Br.

Early pharmacologists focused on natural substances, mainly plant extracts. Pharmacology developed in the 19th century as a biomedical science that applied the principles of scientific experimentation to therapeutic contexts.&lt;ref name=rang&gt;{{cite book|last=Rang|first=H.P.|title=Pharmacology|year=2007 |author2=M.M. Dale |author3=J.M. Ritter |author4=R.J. Flower|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=[[China]]|isbn=0-443-06911-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today pharmacologists use [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and other advanced tools to transform information about molecular mechanisms and targets into therapies directed against disease, defects or pathogens, and create methods for preventative care, diagnostics, and ultimately [[personalized medicine]].

==Divisions==
The discipline of pharmacology can be divided into many sub disciplines each with a specific focus.

===Clinical pharmacology===
[[Clinical pharmacology]] is the basic science of pharmacology with an added focus on the application of pharmacological principles and methods in the [[medical clinic]] and towards patient care and outcomes.

===Neuropharmacology===
[[Neuropharmacology]] is the study of the effects of medication on [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] functioning.

===Psychopharmacology=== 
[[Psychopharmacology]], also known as behavioral pharmacology, is the study of the effects of medication on the [[psyche (psychology)]], observing changed behaviors of the body and mind, and how molecular events are manifest in a measurable behavioral form. Psychopharmacology is an interdisciplinary field which studies behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs. It incorporates approaches and techniques from neuropharmacology, animal behavior and behavioral neuroscience, and is interested in the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of action of psychoactive drugs. Another goal of behavioral pharmacology is to develop animal behavioral models to screen chemical compounds with therapeutic potentials. People in this field (called behavioral pharmacologists) typically use small animals (e.g. rodents) to study psychotherapeutic drugs such as antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytics, and drugs of abuse such as nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine. '''Ethopharmacology''' (not to be confused with [[ethnopharmacology]]) is a term which has been in use since the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 1792005| year = 1991| author1 = Krsiak| first1 = M| title = Ethopharmacology: A historical perspective| journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 439–45| doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(05)80124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ἦθος ''ethos'' meaning character and "pharmacology" the study of drug actions and mechanism.

===Cardiovascular pharmacology===
Cardiovascular pharmacology is the study of the effects of drugs on the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart and blood vessels.

===Pharmacogenetics===
[[Pharmacogenetics]] is clinical testing of genetic variation that gives rise to differing response to drugs.

===Pharmacogenomics===
[[Pharmacogenomics]] is the application of genomic technologies to [[drug discovery]] and further characterization of older drugs.

===Pharmacoepidemiology===
[[Pharmacoepidemiology]] is the study of the effects of drugs in large numbers of people.

===Safety pharmacology===
[[Safety pharmacology]] specialises in detecting and investigating potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of new chemical entities (NCEs) on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above.

===Systems pharmacology===
[[Systems pharmacology]] is the coding system principles in the field of pharmacology.

===Toxicology===
[[Toxicology]] is the study of the [[adverse effect]]s, molecular targets, and characterization of drugs or any chemical substance in excess (including those beneficial in lower doses).

===Theoretical pharmacology===
Theoretical pharmacology is a relatively new and rapidly expanding field of research activity in which many of the techniques of computational chemistry, in particular computational quantum chemistry and the method of molecular mechanics, are proving to be of great value. Theoretical pharmacologists aim at rationalizing the relation between the activity of a particular drug, as observed experimentally, and its structural features as derived from computer experiments. They aim to find structure—activity relations. Furthermore, on the basis of the structure of a given organic molecule, the theoretical pharmacologist aims at predicting the biological activity of new drugs that are of the same general type as existing drugs. More ambitiously, it aims to predict entirely new classes of drugs, tailor-made for specific purposes.

===Posology&lt;!--'Posology' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Posology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the study of how medicines are dosed. This depends upon various factors including age, climate, weight, sex, elimination rate of drug, genetic polymorphism and time of administration. It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words πόσος ''posos'' meaning "how much?" and -λογία ''-logia'' "study of".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/posology "posology"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental pharmacology===
Environmental pharmacology is a new discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2006/38/4/229/27017 | doi=10.4103/0253-7613.27017 | last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2=Khan| first2=RA| title= Environmental pharmacology: A new discipline | journal= Indian J. Pharmacol. |date=Dec 2006| volume=38|  issue=4| pages= 229–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is being given to understand [[gene–environment interaction]], drug-environment interaction and toxin-environment interaction. There is a close collaboration between [[environmental science]] and [[medicine]] in addressing these issues, as healthcare itself can be a cause of [[environmental damage]] or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. Human health and ecology are intimately related. Demand for more pharmaceutical products may place the public at risk through the destruction of species. The entry of chemicals and drugs into the [[aquatic ecosystem]] is a more serious concern today. In addition, the production of some [[illegal drugs]] pollutes drinking water supply by releasing [[carcinogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sue Ruhoy Ilene |author2=Daughton Christian G | year = 2008 | title = Beyond the medicine cabinet: An analysis of where and why medications accumulate | url = | journal = Environment International | volume = 34 | issue = 8| pages = 1157–1169 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is intimately linked with Public Health fields.'''

=== Experimental pharmacology ===
Experimental pharmacology involves the study of pharmacology through [[bioassay]], to test the [[efficacy]] and potency of a drug.

===Dental pharmacology===
[[Dental pharmacology]] relates to the study of drugs commonly used in the treatment of dental disease.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Scientific background==
The study of chemicals requires intimate knowledge of the biological system affected. With the knowledge of [[cell biology]] and [[biochemistry]] increasing, the field of pharmacology has also changed substantially. It has become possible, through molecular analysis of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], to design chemicals that act on specific cellular signaling or [[metabolic pathway]]s by affecting sites directly on cell-surface receptors (which modulate and mediate cellular signaling pathways controlling cellular function).

A chemical has, from the pharmacological point-of-view, various properties. [[Pharmacokinetics]] describes the effect of the body on the chemical (e.g. [[half-life]] and [[volume of distribution]]), and [[pharmacodynamics]] describes the chemical's effect on the body (desired or [[toxic]]).

When describing the pharmacokinetic properties of the chemical that is the active ingredient or [[Active ingredient|active pharmaceutical ingredient]] (API), pharmacologists are often interested in ''L-ADME'':
* [[Liberation (pharmacology)|Liberation]] – How is the API disintegrated (for solid oral forms (breaking down into smaller particles)), dispersed, or dissolved from the medication?
* [[Absorption (digestive)|Absorption]] – How is the API absorbed (through the [[human skin|skin]], the [[intestine]], the [[oral mucosa]])?
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|Distribution]] – How does the API spread through the organism?
* [[Drug metabolism|Metabolism]] – Is the API converted chemically inside the body, and into which substances. Are these active (as well)? Could they be toxic?
* [[Excretion]] – How is the API excreted (through the bile, urine, breath, skin)?

Medication is said to have a narrow or wide ''[[therapeutic index]]'' or ''[[therapeutic window]]''. This describes the ratio of desired effect to toxic effect. A compound with a narrow therapeutic index (close to one) exerts its desired effect at a dose close to its toxic dose. A compound with a wide therapeutic index (greater than five) exerts its desired effect at a dose substantially below its toxic dose. Those with a narrow margin are more difficult to dose and administer, and may require [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] (examples are [[warfarin]], some [[antiepileptic]]s, [[aminoglycoside]] [[antibiotics]]). Most anti-[[cancer]] drugs have a narrow therapeutic margin: toxic side-effects are almost always encountered at doses used to kill [[tumor]]s.

==Medicine development and safety testing==
[[Drug development|Development of medication]] is a vital concern to [[medicine]], but also has strong [[economical]] and [[political]] implications. To protect the [[consumer]] and prevent abuse, many governments regulate the manufacture, sale, and administration of medication. In the [[United States]], the main body that regulates pharmaceuticals is the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and they enforce [[Technical standard|standards]] set by the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]]. In the [[European Union]], the main body that regulates pharmaceuticals is the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] and they enforce standards set by the [[European Pharmacopoeia]].

The metabolic stability and the reactivity of a library of candidate drug compounds have to be assessed for drug metabolism and toxicological studies. Many methods have been proposed for quantitative predictions in drug metabolism; one example of a recent computational method is [http://www.freebase.com/view/en/sporcalc SPORCalc].{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=James Smith |author2=Viktor Stein | year = 2009 | title = SPORCalc: A development of a database analysis that provides putative metabolic enzyme reactions for ligand-based drug design | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–159 | pmid=19157988 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2008.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the chemical structure of a medicinal compound is altered slightly, this could slightly or dramatically alter the medicinal properties of the compound depending on the level of alteration as it relates to the structural composition of the substrate or receptor site on which it exerts its medicinal effect, a concept referred to as the structural activity relationship (SAR). This means that when a useful activity has been identified, chemists will make many similar compounds called analogues, in an attempt to maximize the desired medicinal effect(s) of the compound. This development phase can take anywhere from a few years to a decade or more and is very expensive.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David|author2=Alasdair Thorpe |author3=Chris Otter |title=Revise A2 Chemistry|publisher=[[Heinemann Educational Publishers]]|year=2004|pages=1|isbn =0-435-58347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These new analogues need to be developed. It needs to be determined how safe the medicine is for human consumption, its stability in the human body and the best form for delivery to the desired organ system, like tablet or aerosol. After extensive testing, which can take up to 6 years, the new medicine is ready for marketing and selling.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;

As a result of the long time required to develop analogues and test a new medicine and the fact that of every 5000 potential new medicines typically only one will ever reach the open market, this is an expensive way of doing things, often costing over 1 billion dollars. To recoup this outlay pharmaceutical companies may do a number of things:&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;
* Carefully research the demand for their potential new product before spending an outlay of company funds.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;
* Obtain a patent on the new medicine preventing other companies from producing that medicine for a certain allocation of time.&lt;ref name="ReviseALChem"/&gt;

==Drug legislation and safety==
In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is responsible for creating guidelines for the approval and use of drugs. The FDA requires that all approved drugs fulfill two requirements:
# The drug must be found to be effective against the disease for which it is seeking approval (where 'effective' means only that the drug performed better than placebo or competitors in at least two trials).
# The drug must meet safety criteria by being subject to animal and controlled human testing.

Gaining FDA approval usually takes several years. Testing done on animals must be extensive and must include several species to help in the evaluation of both the effectiveness and toxicity of the drug. The dosage of any drug approved for use is intended to fall within a range in which the drug produces a [[therapeutic effect]] or desired outcome.&lt;ref name=nagle&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagle|first=Hinter|title=Pharmacology: An Introduction|year=2005|author2=Barbara Nagle|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|location=[[Boston]]|isbn=0-07-312275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs in the U.S. is regulated by the federal [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA)|Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987]].

The [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) has a similar role in the UK.

==Education==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Students of pharmacology are trained as biomedical scientists, studying the effects of drugs on living organisms. This can lead to new drug discoveries, as well as a better understanding of the way in which the human body works.

Students of pharmacology must have detailed working knowledge of aspects in physiology, pathology and chemistry. During a typical degree they will cover areas such as (but not limited to) biochemistry, cell biology, basic physiology, genetics and the [[Central Dogma]], medical microbiology, neuroscience, and depending on the department's interests, bio-organic chemistry, or chemical biology.

Modern Pharmacology is highly interdisciplinary. Graduate programs accept students from most biological and chemical backgrounds. With the increasing drive towards biophysical and computational research to describe systems, pharmacologists may even consider themselves mainly physical scientists. In many instances, Analytical Chemistry is closely related to the studies and needs of pharmacological research. Therefore, many institutions will include pharmacology under a Chemistry or Biochemistry Department, especially if a separate Pharmacology Dept. does not exist. What makes an institutional department independent of another, or exist in the first place, is usually an artifact of historical times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1896|title=Examinations In Pharmacology|jstor=20234917|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1833|pages=418–418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas a pharmacy student will eventually work in a pharmacy dispensing medications, a pharmacologist will typically work within a laboratory setting. Careers for a pharmacologist include academic positions (medical and non-medical), governmental positions, private industrial positions, science writing, scientific patents and law, consultation, biotech and pharmaceutical employment, the alcohol industry, food industry, forensics/law enforcement, public health, and environmental/ecological sciences.

==Etymology==
The word "pharmacology" is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:φάρμακον|φάρμακον]]}}, ''pharmakon'', "drug, [[poison]], [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]" and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' "study of", "knowledge of"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pharmacy Pharmacy (n.) - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pharmacology Pharmacology - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. the [[Pharmacy#Etymology|etymology of ''pharmacy'']]).

{{Labor|sp=us}}
'''Precarity''' (also '''precariousness''') is a precarious existence, lacking in [[predictability]], [[job security]], [[materialism|material]] or [[psychology|psychological]] welfare. The social class defined by this condition has been termed the ''[[precariat]]''.

==Catholic origins==
[[Léonce Crenier]], a Catholic [[monk]] who had previously been active as an [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]], may have established the English usage.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 1952 the term was documented by [[Dorothy Day]], writing for the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]:

{{quote|True poverty is rare ... Nowadays communities are good, I am sure, but they are mistaken about poverty. They accept, admit on principle, poverty, but everything must be good and strong, buildings must be fireproof, Precarity is rejected everywhere, and precarity is an essential element of poverty. That has been forgotten. Here we want precarity in everything except the church. ... Precarity enables us to help very much the poor. When a community is always building, and enlarging, and embellishing, which is good in itself, there is nothing left over for the poor. We have no right to do this as long as there are slums and breadlines somewhere.|Anonymous Martinican priest, as quoted by Dorothy Day|The Catholic Worker, May 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/articles/633.html] "Poverty and Precarity," The Catholic Worker, May 1952, by Dorothy Day&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Europe==
{{Original research|date=October 2014}}

It is a term of everyday usage as ''Precariedad'', ''Precariedade'', ''Précarité'', or ''Precarietà'' in a number of European countries, where it refers to the widespread condition of temporary, flexible, contingent, casual, intermittent work in [[postindustrial]] societies, brought about by the neoliberal labor market reforms that have strengthened management and weakened the bargaining power of employees since the late 1970s.

''Precarity'' is a general term to describe how large parts of the population are being subjected to flexible exploitation or ''[[flexicurity|flexploitation]]'' (low pay, high blackmailability, intermittent income, etc.), and existential precariousness (high risk of social exclusion because of low incomes, welfare cuts, high cost of living, etc.) The condition of precarity is said{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to affect all of [[service sector]] labor in a narrow sense, and the whole of society in a wider sense, but particularly youth, women, and immigrants.

While [[contingent labor]] has been a constant of capitalist societies since the industrial revolution, [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] have argued&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire'', New York: Penguin Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; that the flexible labor force has now moved from the peripheral position it had under [[Fordism]] to a core position in the process of capitalist accumulation under [[Post-Fordism]], which is thought to be increasingly based on the casualized efforts of affective, creative, [[immaterial labor]]. There is scattered [[empirical evidence]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} in support of this thesis, such as the growing share of non-standard employment on the overall labor force, particularly on new hires. For example, in Western Europe, between a quarter and a third of the labor force now works under temporary and/or part-time contracts, with peaks in UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy.

More problematic is that precarity seems to conflate two categories of workers that are at opposite ends of [[labor market segmentation]] in postindustrial economies: pink collars working in retail and low-end services (cleaners, janitors, etc.) under
constrictive but standardized employment norms; and young talent temping for cheap in the information economy of big cities around the world: the [[creative class]] of strongly individualistic workers illustrated by managerial literature.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}}

It also remains to be seen whether the insider–outsider division that economists observe in European labor markets means that the young, precarious, non-voting, and non-owning outsiders have fundamentally conflicting aims with respect to older insiders, who tend to work full-time, long-term contracts, enjoy relatively high pension benefits and who command a disproportionate weight in European public opinion and political debate.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}}

===Global justice movement===
Around 2000, the word started being used in its English usage by some [[global justice movement]] (sometimes identified with [[antiglobalization]]) activists (''Marches Européennes contre le chômage la précarité et les exclusions'' - European Marches against unemployment, precarity and social exclusion), and also in [[European Union|EU]] official reports on [[social welfare]]. But it was in the strikes of young part-timers at [[McDonald's]] and [[Pizza Hut]] in winter 2000, that the first political union network emerged in Europe explicitly devoted to fighting precarity: Stop Précarité, with links to AC!, [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]], SUD, [[Confédération nationale du travail|CNT]], [[Trotsky]]ists and other elements of the French radical left.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Mabrouki, ''Génération précaire'', Le Cherche Midi, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the Italian collectives and networks identifying with the global justice movement, as they were preparing for the [[Genoa]] counter-summit just months away, inaugurated in [[Milan]] a new kind of first of May, MAYDAY, spelling it like the [[Mayday (distress signal)|international call for rescue]], and explicitly centering it on the street representation of the so-called "precarious generation." It employed [[carnival]]-like techniques of agitation (allegorical wagons, media subvertising, colorful actions etc.) in imitation of [[gay pride]]s and love parades of the 1990s. Italian activists meant it as a revival of the [[wobbly]] traditions of [[May Day]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and consequently as a break with traditional union representation and social-democratic compromise that had allowed precarity and social insecurity to spread unchecked to reach critical levels in all of Europe, thus repeating the experience of UK and US economies with a few years' lag.

By 2003, the event had grown exponentially{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} in size, and Catalan global justice activists participated as non-neutral observers. In 2004, activists in [[Barcelona]] joined the Mayday efforts, as delegations of French "Intermittents" participated as guests of honor in both Mayday parades. The same year saw the launch of the [[icon]] of ''San Precario'', [[patron saint]] of the struggle against precarity. The religious imagery proved very popular in [[Italy]] and elsewhere, and would colonize the mainstream mediascape in the following years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} By virtue of all these developments, Mayday 2004 drew 80,000 young protesters from all over Italy. This attracted attention from other parts of [[Europe]].

===EuroMayDay===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
In October 2004, libertarian and syndicalist collectives from across Europe gathered at Middlesex University at "Beyond ESF" (a critical reference to the [[European Social Forum]] that was being held in London at the same time) in order to give life to a unified European May Day of precarious and migrant workers: '''EUROMAYDAY''', which involved a dozen [[Western Europe]]an cities in 2005, and about twenty in 2006, with Milan, Paris, Helsinki, Hamburg, and Sevilla among the most lively nodes. In 2006, the mayday process was launched in [[Brussels]] on [[Good Friday]] with a few hundred activists from Belgium, France, Italy, and Germany protesting against pro-business lobbies in Europe: "no borders, no precarity: fuck the new inequality!".

The [[EuroMayDay]] network has gathered several times across the EU to discuss in its assemblies common actions against precarity and mobilizations against the persecution of immigrants, and particularly the segregation of undocumented migrants in detention centers all over Europe. EuroMayDay demands the full adoption of the EU directive on temporary workers being blocked by the [[Barroso Commission]], as well as a European minimum wage and basic income. Cyber and queer rights are also part of the mayday deliberations and activities.

===Rebelling against precarity in France and Denmark===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
A core constituency of mayday has been the movement of [[Intermittents]], the French expression to refer to stage hands and showbiz personnel. In 2002–2005, the Intermittents captured the French imagination and filled the press with their inventive rebellious tactics (e.g. they disrupted live TV news programs and the 2004 edition of the Cannes festival) denouncing precarity in the form of cuts to their [[unemployment benefits]] (they counterproposed an alternative reform of the system which was so well crafted that put French élites and union leaders in an awkward position).

In the early months of 2006, French youth rejected the CPE, the first-job contract introduced by the government who made it easier to fire workers under age 26. Clashes with the riot police, as it reclaimed Sorbonne from occupying students was the signal that something major
was happening, as the university had been the epicenter of social insurgence in 1968. Four decades later, France was again paralyzed by huge student demonstrations and solidarity strikes called by the major French unions, as well as the more militant unions and organizations. With the vast majority of French universities occupied for more than a month, and the whole nation on strike, the [[Villepin]] government was forced to withdraw the provision, in a test of force with democracy in the streets that weakened the presidency itself. ''Le Monde'' commented that "précarité" was going to be a central issue in the upcoming 2007 presidential elections.

A few months before, France had been rocked by generalized rioting of the French youth of Arab and African descent in its suburban ghettos (''cités''), who sought to express angst at racial and economic discrimination that they were experiencing from the rest of French society. Although expressions of the same national malaise and social anguish, banlieue rioters and student protesters did not really share tactics and demands. The French explosion of 2006 against precarity was followed a few months later by a lengthy general strike in [[Denmark]] to protest against welfare cuts especially discriminatory with respect to young people. All universities were occupied, and the right-wing government was forced to withdraw the provisions that had to do with student subsidies and other welfare benefits for young people, although it retained pension cuts for older employees.

==="San Precario"===
February 29 is the [[feast day]] of San Precario, the [[patron saint]] of precarious workers, who – together with his feast day – was created by the [[Chainworkers]] at the [[Milan]]ese space [[Reload (collective)|Reload]] where the 2004 [[EuroMayDay]] was organised with others, including the [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] group. The Milan Critical Mass already had its own patron saint, "Santa Graziella" (''[[:it:Graziella (bicicletta)|Graziella]]'' is the brand name of a popular Italian [[folding bicycle]]).

San Precario was originally conceived as a male saint (Romano, 2004). The saint's first public appearance was at a Sunday supermarket opening on February 29, 2004: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A statue was carried in the streets, preceded by assorted clergy including a cardinal reciting prayers over a loudspeaker, and followed by pious people.&lt;ref name="journal.fibreculture.org"&gt;Marcello Tarì and Ilaria Vanni. [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/vanni_tari.html "On the Life and Deeds of San Precario, Patron Saint of Precarious Workers and Lives"]. ''The Fibreculture Journal'' '''5''', 2005. Retrieved March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ChainWorkers then performed a hoax during the 2005 [[Milan Fashion Week]], creating a fictive stylist, Serpica Naro,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chainworkers.org/SERPICANARO/index.html Serpica Naro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202182925/http://www.chainworkers.org/SERPICANARO/index.html |date=2012-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose name was an anagram of "San Precario".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Abbiamo creato Serpica Naro in 7 giorni e con pochi soldi' |author=Rosaria Amato |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/modanoglobal/intervistaserpica/intervistaserpica.html |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |date=February 26, 2005 |access-date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groups claim that the name functions like a multiple user name or myth such as [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] and quote the [[Wu Ming]] collective in giving theoretical coherence, although it is mostly seen as a [[détournement]] of the [[Catholic]] concept of patron saints.&lt;ref name="journal.fibreculture.org"/&gt;

== Precariat ==
{{main|Precariat}}
In [[sociology]], ''precariat'' refers to the [[social class]] formed by people with no [[job security]], or no prospect of regular employment, distinct from the [[lumpenproletariat]]. The term is a [[neologism]] obtained by merging ''precarious'' with [[proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Lunning (2010).[https://books.google.com/books?id=5d0Q9fdinQUC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=precariat+proletariat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XAtzTpGLO46Tswb4pJmOCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=precariat%20proletariat&amp;f=false'' Mechademia 5: Fanthropologies'']. University of Minnesota Press. p.&amp;nbsp;252. {{ISBN|081667387X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precariat class has been emerging in advanced societies such as Japan, where it includes over 20 million so-called "[[freeter]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/359fa9a8-8545-11df-9c2f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Y0hvtoZ1 Financial Times, July 1 2010: ''Japan has to address the ‘precariat’'']&lt;/ref&gt; The young precariat class in Europe became a serious issue in the early part of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Press Europe: Sept 15, 2011: The "Youthful members of the full-time precariat [http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/953511-youthful-members-full-time-precariat]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shrewsbury Business Park''' is a commercial development on the outskirts of [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]] (at [[Emstrey, Shropshire|Emstrey]]). Construction commenced in late 2001 on the {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}}, £25 million site, and is still ongoing. Almost {{convert|200,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} of business premises have been delivered, largely attributed to Phase One of the scheme. Over 1,000 people are based there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/money/careers/2011/02/28/1000-jobs-planned-for-shrewsbury-business-park/ |title=1,000 jobs planned for Shrewsbury Business Park |publisher=Shropshire Star |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was first promoted by local developer the Alaska Group, which entered into a partnership with Shropshire County Council. Mainly offices, the business park includes a Holiday Inn Express  Hotel and a children's daycare centre. Plans exist for a cafe retail unit at the heart of the development.

Alaska Group was founded in London in 1994 in a former fur factory known as the Alaska Works, where skins were imported from Alaska.  The company has no other connection with Alaska, however it gave the Park several quotes from that State. The main route through the Park, Sitka Drive, is named after the National tree of Alaska. Other names include Anchorage Avenue, Mt McKinley Building, Bering House and Juneau House.

Located around 3 miles / 5km south east of the town centre of Shrewsbury, Shropshire's [[county town]], the [[business park]] lies on the junction of the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] bypass and the B4380, near to Emstrey. The park's appeal is partly thanks to excellent transport links via the nearby [[M54 motorway]] to [[Telford]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Birmingham]], while being near to a fine medieval town and beautiful countryside. 

Other business park developments in and around the town include the [[Oxon Business Park]] to the West of the town centre and the Battlefield Enterprise Park to the North, and Abbey Lawn next to [[Shrewsbury Abbey]], just across the [[Severn]] from the town centre.

==Buildings==
[[Image:Shrewsbury_Business_Park_2.jpg|thumb|288px|right|The Alaska Building]]
[[Image:Shrewsbury_Business_Park_1.jpg|thumb|288px|right|A typical building style on the site]]

The park's buildings are a combination of fully customised modern and traditional structures, all with dedicated parking.

The Creative Quarter is home to five offices, The Alaska Building (Pictured Right), Global House, Mercury House, Jupiter House and the Community Council Building

Mtech's office, seen bottom right, is typical of some of the smaller properties available on the development.

The Professional Quarter is of more traditional brick design and includes professional clients including Handelsbanken.

==Plot==
Ben Selleck's car dealership, in [[Temecula, California]], is failing and he is forced to hire a mercenary, Don Ready. They have 211 cars to sell over the [[4th of July]] weekend. Don's team of Babs, Jibby, and Brent promise Ben that they will make the dealership a profit after the weekend.

On the first day the crowds gather outside for hot dogs and other gimmicks. Don notices that the naturally talented salesman, Blake, could be his son (he was in the town before and had a brief fling while there). The sales team sells the cars by any means necessary and finish the day selling 71 cars. Before they can leave the lot Stu and his son Paxton from the opposing dealership offer to purchase the lot. Since Paxton is marrying Ben's daughter, Ivy, he is trying to put his future father-in-law out of business. Paxton only wants practice space for his "man-band", Big Ups, and eventually wants to take them worldwide. Ben is about to finalize a deal with Stu but Don promises to sell every car on the lot.

The second day starts off poorly with a dishonest commercial that Ben is dying of [[testicular cancer]]. When it is time for Eric Bice, [[Bo Bice]]'s brother to take the stage he backs out at the last minute and Don takes the stage. The crowd riots when they find out Don is an atrocious singer. Taking advantage of all the cameras on the lot from the riot, the team starts a sale for 20% off to the police.

Don is taking stock in his life when Ivy questions him about one of his jobs in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. Don tells her that he killed his best friend and team DJ, McDermott (played in a flashback by [[Will Ferrell]]), by giving him a bag with [[sex toys]] instead of a parachute. Don was more focused on having sex with his customer than selling cars. He then reveals to Ivy that he is falling for her and it is all happening again. That night Ivy comes to Don's hotel room and they have sex.

Ivy reveals that it was a one-night stand and is not breaking up with Paxton. Don is furious and storms out yelling that he only trusts cars after what he's been done by Ivy. The team searches but cannot find Don, they get pumped up to sell the 105 cars left on the lot without him. While wandering the desert Don sees the deceased McDermott with two angels. McDermott tells Don that everything is about the team, people you love, and that he should get off the road and settle down. In the time it takes Don to get back to the dealership the team sells every car on the lot.

Don parachutes onto the lot but Stu and Paxton inform him the "bandit car" (an expensive prop that was used in the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films) is not sold and the dealership is theirs. Don convinces Paxton to buy the bandit car, which saves the lot, and Paxton leaves Ivy to tour with his band. Don announces that he is going to get off the road so he can care for his friends and family more. Don marries Ivy and adopts Blake (despite the fact that Blake knows he is not, in fact, Don's son) but they get divorced two years later.

'''The Paper Province''' is a [[business cluster]] for the [[pulp and paper industry]] in [[Värmland]], northern [[Dalsland]] and the county of [[Örebro]] in central [[Sweden]]. It is focussed on encouraging collaboration on marketing, skills development, procurement, project development and regional growth. The cluster organization is owned and operated by its 90 member companies, from global giants to local suppliers, representing the entire [[value chain]].

==History==
Business history in Värmland and the surrounding area is strongly influenced by the region's natural wealth. Successful exploitation of the forest started early, and already in the mid-19th century there were more than 50 pulp and paper mills in the region. This attracted both skills and suppliers to the region. Much the technology used and installed in pulp and paper mills throughout the world still originates here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.risiinfo.com/technologyarchives/papermaking/The-Paper-Province-u2013-the-Hollywood-of-the-paper-industry.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221041735/http://www.risiinfo.com/technologyarchives/papermaking/The-Paper-Province-u2013-the-Hollywood-of-the-paper-industry.html |archivedate=2009-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1990s the pulp and paper industry was facing severe structural challenges. To meet these needs, seven companies, together with [[Karlstad|Karlstad’s]] county and other public bodies, formed the cluster organization 'The Paper Province'. The number of member companies has grown to 90 with over 9,000 employees and annual sales of approximately SEK 17 billion, of which 13.5 billion contributes to Sweden’s net exports. In this, the member companies represent a significant part of the region's economy, with effects on both the regional and national economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tci-network.org/cluster/initiative/3415&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milestones==
* In 1999 the cluster organization The Paper Province was established.
* In 2004 The Paper Province established The Packaging Greenhouse, an independent and commercial R&amp;D centre featuring a pilot machine and laboratories. Companies from across the world apply to the centre to test new products and services within the packaging industry. The research resources within the region is strengthened by [[Karlstad University]] and seven businesses operated R&amp;D centres focusing on pulp and paper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepackaginggreenhouse.com/cgi-bin/webbpub-s/ak_webbpub-s.cgi?funk=Start&amp;Sprak_ID=en&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, The Paper Province launched The Energy Square, the world’s first international centre for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in the pulp and paper industry. Its aim is to simplify the process for developing new products and services that reduce energy consumption within the global pulp and paper industry. The Energy Square has a strong international appeal and co-operates with, among others, the China National Pulp &amp; Paper Research Institute (CNPPRI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energysquare.se/&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007 The Paper Province was appointed one of Europe's most innovative clusters in a survey including more than 2,100 European clusters. The survey was conducted by the European Cluster Observatory, which works on behalf of the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kU4aIfb8Mm8J:ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/conferences/evaluation2009/abstracts/bjurulf.doc+%22paper+province%22+%2Binnovative+%2Bcluster&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=sv&amp;ct=clnk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration==
The Paper Province collaborates with a variety of partners to retain and enhance the competitiveness of the pulp and paper industry. In addition to the member companies, this includes universities and a variety of public actors, such as municipalities, 'Region Värmland', VINNOVA and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Tillväxtverket).

For several years, 'Region Värmland' has carried out independent surveys measuring the performance of The Paper Province and its impact on member companies. The 2009 survey showed that the member companies found that their participation resulted in increased collaboration, new products and services, increased sales and new job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regionvarmland.se/sites/default/files/grupper/www/Made_in_Sweden_2009_A4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220041754/http://www.regionvarmland.se/sites/default/files/grupper/www/Made_in_Sweden_2009_A4.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ageing father's declining health and the downturn in the family's fortunes probably curtailed his opportunity for further formal education. In 1867, twenty year old Theodore inherited the family estate. He was introduced into society to find a suitable match. When he was 27, he was introduced during a New Year's ball to the twenty year old, Julia Bożeniec Jełowicka, descended from [[Ruthenian nobility|Ruthenian aristocracy]] whose legal guardian was [[Feliks Sobański]], a first cousin of Theodore's mother. Marriage followed in 1874 and her dowry temporarily boosted the depleted Szymanowski coffers. The couple went on to have seven sons, of whom one died in infancy, and one daughter. Whether due to the economic climate or to mismanagement, by 1885 the family were obliged to abandon their home and livelihood of the preceding 130 years. There is a suggestion that the estate may have been [[Russification|confiscated]] by the authorities as a result of Theodore's political activities, although evidence for this has not been confirmed. He was careful to express his controversial views in French and have them published in Paris, out of the [[Russian Tsar Alexander I|Tsar's]] reach.{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=61}} In effect, the family was 'exiled' to [[Western Ukraine]] where it remained in straitened circumstances for the duration of Theodor's life.{{sfn|TK-S|2015|pp=58–9}}

==Anticipation of a unified Europe==
Korwin Szymanowski's polemical ''L'avenir économique, social et politique en Europe'' – The Future of Europe in Economic, Political and Social Terms – was written in French in 1885 and published in Paris in 1885 and 88.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Korwin Szymanowski, Théodore de, (1885/8) ''L'avenir économique, social et politique en Europe'', Paris: Ed. H. Marot.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Poland was a dismembered state and occupied by Russia, Prussia and [[Austria-Hungary]]. His work begins with this exhortation:

::''Pardonnez l'incorrection à l'auteur, qui n'est Français que par sympathie, mais lisez jusqu'à la fin, et cherchez, dans ces idées détachées et en désordre, l'énigme de nos malheures.'' –
'Forgive the author's poor style, as he is a Frenchman only by sentiment, but read on to the end, and seek, in these disparate and unorganised thoughts, the enigma of our misfortunes.'{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=7}}

As a declared [[francophile]], he envisaged a Europe predicated on a reformed parliamentary system, a customs union, centrally collected statistics, financial contributions from all the participating European states for deposit and lending via a central bank with a [[common currency]], for preference, the [[French franc]].&lt;ref&gt;Korwin Szymanowski, Théodore de (1890). ''Conférence Internationale sur les Réformes Parlementaires'', Paris: Ed. A. Reiff. Re-issued in Paperback by HACHETTE LIVRE-BNF (12 Jun 2013), {{ISBN|978-2011785671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korwin Szymanowski, Théodore de (1890). ''Conférence Internationale Douanière'', Paris: Ed. Bourdarie.&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis was not influenced by any kind of Socialism in the style of French contemporaries like [[Henry Maret]] or [[Jules Ferry]].{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=41}} It was underscored by a form of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], born probably out of his deep commitment to [[Catholicism]], combined with a deliberate nod to the absolutist authorities in [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=68}}

The text lay forgotten until its rediscovery in a library at the start of the 21st century. It is not yet known whether it influenced, however indirectly, the architects of the post-war [[European Common Market]], people like [[Robert Schuman]] from Metz or [[Jean Monnet]], seventy years after he wrote down his economic design for a unified Europe. As commented by his recent editor, Prof. Żurawski vel Grajewski in the postface, Szymanowski's contribution was part of a wider 19th c. European concern about an ailing Europe that felt threatened by social unrest and the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]]. His innovation was to focus on economics, statistics and monetary policy rather than on questions of nationalism, sovereignty or federalism. Irrespective of whether it was a republic or monarchy, though he preferred the latter, he made the distinction between nation and state.{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=68}}

Through church and family connections, he was able to make a rare visit to France and attend the 1890 Paris Antislavery Conference convened by [[Cardinal Lavigerie]].&lt;ref&gt;''Documents relatifs au Congrès Libre Antiesclavagiste tenu à Paris le 21, 22 et 23 septembre 1890''.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish historian Radosław Żurawski vel Grajewski makes a case for Korwin Szymanowski benefiting greatly from the presence and contacts in Paris of his wife's uncle, the émigré activist and musician, Théodore Jełowicki (1828–1905). He would have been in a position to facilitate the publication of Korwin Szymanowski's work.{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=61}}

&lt;!--- == Legacy ==
Speculative though the connection may seem, Jełowicki was a close friend and confidant of the émigré poet [[Cyprian Norwid]], whose muse in Paris was the Polish pianist [[Maria Kalergis]]. Kalergis' great-grandson was [[Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi]] founder in 1923 of the [[Paneuropean Union]].---&gt;

==Poetical works==
Only two poetical works by Korwin Szymanowski are extant, both written in Polish; one published in Paris and the other in Kiev. They are allegorical works in marked contrast to his economic and political polemics, drawing on his religious preoccupations yet informed by his personal dilemmas and those of his nation deprived of statehood for over a century. The first work concerns the history of the world and the creation of [[Order of angels|angels]] and the fall of some of them.&lt;ref&gt;Korwin Szymanowski, Teodor, (1890). ''Historya świata część 1sza – Stworzenie Aniołów'', Paris: Ed. A. Reiff.&lt;/ref&gt; The second work tells the heroic story of a Ruthenian princess, [[Sophia Olelkovich Radziwill]], who was declared a saint by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in 1983. His subtext seemed to be that Christian denominations, especially Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox should cooperate in the face of perceived common threats.&lt;ref&gt;Korwin Szymanowski, Teodor, (1891). ''Zofija Olelkiewiczówna – księżniczka słucka'', Kiev: Ed. G.L. Fronckevič. The full text of the poem is reproduced in the Appendix to the MSZ 2015 re-issue of the dual text of Korwin Szymanowski's "L'Avenir …''  The work can be sourced from the publications department of the [[MSZ]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite falling on hard times, Korwin Szymanowski maintained a constructive outlook throughout his written work. He died at the relatively young age of 55 in abject poverty and was buried in Kiev. His grave has not survived.{{sfn|TK-S|2015|p=63}}

Kanban system used in manufacturing line mostly using manual kanban in their planning and execution.
It is a very complex system when using in Supply Chain management system within automotive industry in which there are several layers of supply to the main principal. 
As suppliers must adopt kanban system to support main principal, they are struggling with the execution. 
Especially when they are a large company supply to several major automotive principals with thousands of articles in production line

To overcome this problem some companies developed e-Kanban system to move the complexities into programmable system. This has eliminated problem with thousands of kanban cards at production lines. 
However, for most Japanese companies the spirit of Kanban is lost in full e-Kanban system
No more cards, no more teamwork spirit when dealing with problems in the field.

To accommodate this problem, there is a system called Virtual Kanban G5.
The purposes is having e-kanban in the system while maintaining kanban cards as a data input.
Workers and managers still feel the kanban process in their manufacturing lines while having a detailed real-time data flow in the system.

'''William Dodd''' (born 18 June 1804) was an Englishman who came to notice when he described his work and growing disability as a [[child labor|child worker]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He was employed by the reformer [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]] after writing about child workers in the textile industry, but Shaftesbury later sacked him after accusations were made that Dodd was lying and was a disgruntled employee. He wrote one more book on a related subject that was written and published in America.

==Biography==
Dodd was born in 1804 in [[Kendal]], Westmorland and by the age of five he was at work.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt; Dodd said that he came from a family that was well remunerated but that had fallen down the class structure by the time he started work.&lt;ref name=labor&gt;Dodd, William (1847) - [[s:The Laboring Classes of England/Letter 1|''The Laboring Classes of England'' - Letter 1: 'Introduction']]'&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd came to notice in 1840 when he published with the support of the social reformer [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]] a book which described his own and his sisters' experiences as child workers. He described how they all worked in a textile factory and sometimes they would work for 18 hours per day.&lt;ref name=albrecht&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albrecht|first1=editor, Gary L.|title=Encyclopedia of disability|date=2006|publisher=Sage Online|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412950510|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/disability/n977.xml|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd blamed this experience for making him a cripple and by the time he wrote his first book he had had one arm amputated as it had swollen; the doctors later reported that the bone was "honeycomb" and lacked bone marrow.&lt;ref name=wdodd&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRdodd.htm William Dodd] in ''Spartacus Educational'', retrieved 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd was able to write the book as he had learnt to write at evening classes&lt;ref name=albrecht/&gt; whilst working in Kendal. It was his job at that time to check the ages of young children who were employed at Isaac and William Wilson's textile mill. His first use of his literacy was to become a clerk at the same mill.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt;

In 1837, Dodd briefly started his own school where he passed on his skills in reading, writing and arithmetic. School teaching was meant to suit his increasing disability but he lost the rooms he was renting and this ended the endeavor. Dodd's disability meant that he said that he was unable to find a wife and he resolved to abandon the idea of marriage and he moved to London.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt;

In London, he worked as a clerk. After he had his arm amputated, he decided to write his autobiography. The text of ''A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings of William Dodd a Factory Cripple'' was sent to Lord Ashley, who was well known for his interest in child labour, and it was published. Ashley was a member of parliament and he had campaigned for children to be restricted to a ten-hour day. His motion was defeated but it led to the 1833 [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] which created a minimum age of nine for working in a textile factory and introduced maximum hours for all children under 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRashley.htm Lord Ashley], Spartacus, retrieved 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley employed Dodd and he wrote ''The Factory System: Illustrated'' to describe the conditions of working children in textile manufacture, which was published in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10001537 Anthony Ashley Cooper], HistoryMole, retrieved 2 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

These books and Dodd were attacked by Quaker politician [[John Bright]] in a parliamentary committee on the Factories Bill on 15 March 1844. Bright said that he had evidence that the books describing Dodd's mistreatment were in fact created by Dodd's ingratitude as a disgruntled employee. Moreover, he had evidence that Dodd had reported that Lord Ashley was only using him because he was an example of a cripple damaged by work in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1844/mar/15/hours-of-labour-in-factories#S3V0073P0_18440315_HOC_32 Lours of Labour], House in Committee on the Factories Bill, Hansard, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley sacked Dodd who emigrated to America where he wrote ''The Laboring Classes of England'', which was published in Boston in 1847. It is not known where Dodd lived or died after this date.&lt;ref name=wdodd/&gt;

On October 4, 2006 he said publicly that IDF Chief of Staff [[Dan Halutz]] should accept responsibility for malfunctions in the [[2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict|Israel-Hezbollah War]] and accept the consequences. He hinted that [[Israel]]i PM [[Ehud Olmert]] should do the same.

"Those who directed this war must take responsibility," Ron-Tal said on [[Israel Radio]], "We did not win this war, and it is proper that those who directed it should take responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/770328.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080821150529/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/770328.html |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also said that employing the IDF to evacuate settlers from the [[Gaza Strip Israeli Settlements]] in 2005 was a grave mistake because it had seriously degraded the army's combat capabilities. Following these remarks, he was discharged from the IDF while on leave after 33 years of service, two months prior to retirement. The Israeli media reported though that Ron-Tal had sent a letter of resignation prior to being fired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/770516.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/771152.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the comments themselves were not the most vitriolic heard since the end of the Israel-Hezbollah war, Ron-Tal was roundly criticized for making them while still in uniform. Even though Ron-Tal was on a final leave of absence before leaving the army, orders state that active soldiers are forbidden from giving interviews to the media without permission from the [[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]], especially resenting opinions about the army and politics. He was the second general officer to criticize Halutz while in uniform over the war, the first being [[Ilan Harari]].

In a previous controversial interview in 2003, he had advocated the liquidation of [[PLO]] chairman [[Yasser Arafat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/content/print_article.cfm?itemID=4435&amp;sectionID=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron-Tal serves as head of the Israel Electric Corporation, after having headed the [[Israel Port Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3511469,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Álvaro Carlos Alsogaray''' (June 22, 1913 &amp;ndash; April 1, 2005) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] politician and businessman. [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]] during much of the 1959-62 period, he was one of the principal proponents of [[neoliberalism|economic conservatism]] in modern Argentina.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Alsogaray was born in [[Esperanza, Santa Fe]], in 1913, as the eldest of three children to Julia Elisa Bosch and Álvaro Alsogaray. Born to a prominent local military family, Alsogaray graduated from the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación|National Military College]] as an infantry officer. He studied [[military engineering]] in the Army's School of Higher Technical Studies and [[civil engineer|civil]] and [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineer]] at the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|National University of Córdoba]]. He married Edith Gay in 1940, and had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=edith&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/610903-murio-ayer-la-madre-de-maria-julia-alsogaray|title=Murió ayer la madre de María Julia Alsogaray|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from the army with the rank of [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] and with two [[engineer]]ing degrees, which led to his being called ''el capitán ingeniero''. He entered business, becoming an important contractor for [[State enterprise]]s such as FAMA (a predecessor of [[flag carrier]] [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]]), and briefly served as its director during the presidency of [[Juan Perón]], whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to Alsogaray's thinking.&lt;ref name=golpe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/583935-alvaro-alsogaray-el-unico-golpe-justificable-fue-el-del-55|title=Alvaro Alsogaray: "El único golpe justificable fue el del 55"|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Revolución Libertadora|coup that removed Perón]] in 1955, he held the posts of Under-secretary of Commerce and Minister of Industry, and maintained numerous Peronist staffers at the Undersecretariat despite his support for the coup.&lt;ref name=golpe/&gt; He founded the Independent Civic Party in 1956; the party fared modestly in the [[Argentine general election, 1958|1958 elections]].

===President Frondizi and the two "winters"===
[[File:Alsogaray y Frondizi.jpg|thumb|left|Alsogaray and President Arturo Frondizi (''left''), who appointed the conservative businessman under pressure from the military.]]
To placate powerful agrarian interests and other [[conservative]]s, the otherwise progressive [[Arturo Frondizi]] named Alsogaray Minister of the Economy in early 1959.  Inheriting large trade deficits, Alsogaray sharply devalued the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|peso]] and imposed severe credit controls on Argentina's large public banks.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-49222-2005-04-02.html ''Página/12'' :: El país :: Alsogaray no llegó al invierno {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Declaring that the economy "must go through winter",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/1959.htm Todo Argentina: 1959 {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; the austerity measures were a boon to exporters - but caused consumer prices to double in 1959, and real wages and construction to fall by about 20%.&lt;ref name=crisis&gt;Lewis, Paul. ''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting trade surplus and pro-growth policies pursued by Frondizi's unofficial point man on the economy, [[Rogelio Julio Frigerio]], both contributed to a robust recovery in 1960 and 1961.&lt;ref name=todofr&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/index.html Todo Argentina: Frondizi {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=came&gt;[http://www.redcame.org.ar/index.php/came/noticia/1165 Cornide, Osvaldo. ''A 50 años de la asunción de Arturo Frondizi''. {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized in favor of Frigerio after the 1959 [[recession]] and deeply unpopular, Alsogaray resigned early in 1961. Frigerio had been President Frondizi's first choice for the critical Economy Ministry, an appointment thwarted by the military; Frondizi and Frigerio later founded the [[Integration and Development Movement|MID]], a political party centered around the need for accelerated development.&lt;ref name=todofr/&gt;&lt;ref name=came/&gt;

Frondizi's efforts to [[Arturo Frondizi#Foreign policy|mediate differences between the United States and Cuba]] ultimately resulted in a [[Coups d'état in Argentina#Coup of March 29, 1962|March, 1962, coup d'état]], and Álvaro Alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother, General [[Julio Rodolfo Alsogaray|Julio Alsogaray]], to secure several ministerial and planning posts under Frondizi's military-appointed successor, Senate President [[José María Guido]]. Reintroducing many of his restrictive 1959 policies, as well as nearly worthless "Ninth of July" bonds, which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public employees and government contractors, the economy again slipped into severe recession; the trade balance improved, albeit the cost of depressed business investment.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt;&lt;ref name=todofr/&gt;

===Later career and the rise of María Julia===
Out of power after the election of Dr. [[Arturo Illia]] in 1963, Alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration, even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed. Finding allies in conservative business and media interests, the powerful [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Roman Catholic Church]], and his influential brother Julio, Alsogaray and other Illia opponents were successful.&lt;ref name=rock&gt;Rock, David. ''Authoritarian Argentina''. University of California Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/illia/index.htm Todo Argentina: Arturo Illia {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Revolución Argentina|1966 coup]] against President Illia, he was designated [[United States-Argentina relations|Ambassador to the United States]], a post he held until 1968.&lt;ref name=rock/&gt;

Alsogaray founded the 'New Force' in 1972, though like the Independent Civic Party, it fared poorly in the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|1973 elections]] that returned Perón to power. He was among the few conservative figures to publicly oppose the imminent [[March 1976 coup]],&lt;ref name=golpe/&gt; but largely supported the subsequent [[National Reorganization Process]].&lt;ref name=p12/&gt; As the dictatorship eventually yielded to calls for elections, he founded the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCeDé) in 1982. Running as a right-wing, economically [[neoliberalism|conservative]] candidate on the latter ticket, he stood for the [[President of Argentina|Presidency]] in 1983 and 1989. Alsogaray received two million votes (10%) in his [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 presidential bid]], behind only major party candidates [[Carlos Menem]] and [[Eduardo Angeloz]].

Continuing to enjoy a measure of support in [[Buenos Aires]]' affluent [[Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires|northside]], he and his daughter [[María Julia Alsogaray]] were elected the only two national [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|deputies]] for the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|UCeDé]] in [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983]], and he served until 1999. A vehement anti-Peronist and anti-socialist, Alsogaray forged an alliance with the late Juan Perón's [[Justicialist Party]] in 1989, following their nomination of pro-market Governor [[Carlos Menem]], and endorsed Justicialist candidate Eduardo Vaca that year in a tightly-contested seat in the [[Argentine Senate]] representing the City of Buenos Aires. Argentine Senators were [[indirectly elected]] at the time, and Alsogaray's endorsement in the electoral college gave Vaca the seat, despite the latter's coming in second to centrist [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] candidate [[Fernando de la Rúa]].&lt;ref name=ln&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=692635 ''La Nación'' (April 2, 2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] granted Alsogaray an [[honorary doctorate]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctoral Degrees at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vocal supporter of the era's [[privatization]]s, he prevailed on President Menem to appoint his daughter, María Julia, Secretary of the Environment, in which post she served from 1991 to 1999, and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the Menem presidency, endorsing the populist-turned-conservative president in his [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 re-election bid]].&lt;ref name=p12/&gt; Among his most notable roles in this era was as director of a feasibility study in 1995-96 for the replacement of Buenos Aires' two international airports for an island terminal on the [[Río de la Plata]]; opposed by de la Rúa, who had been elected Mayor (and would later be President), the project never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/08/22/t-04201d.htm ''Clarín'' (August 22, 1996) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; His UCedé party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies, as because of rivalries in the party itself &amp;ndash; notably between his daughter and Adelina D'Alessio de Viola (whom he had Menem appoint as head of the [[Banco Hipotecario|National Mortgage Bank]]). Commenting on the dispute, he remarked that ''"would it that one's political party could do without affiliates...or women!"'' &lt;ref name=ln/&gt;

===Legacy===
Alsogaray, who perennially sought [[television]] airtime, lived out his last few years in seclusion. He lost his wife in 2004,&lt;ref name=edith/&gt; and died in [[Buenos Aires]] the following year at the age of 91.  Adamantly [[conservative]], he was of the opinion that, if anything, the 1976-83 dictatorship was too moderate.  He felt that some of the most brutal torturers during [[Dirty War]], such as [[Alfredo Astiz]], were "heroes," and even once attempted to use his influence over the Menem administration to have a monument built in their honor.&lt;ref name=p12/&gt;
