      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3813">'''Atlantic''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] toy manufacturing company based in [[Treviglio]] from 1966 to 1984. In the 1970s it became widely popular both in Italy and in [[Europe]] as a producer of 1:72- and [[HO scale|HO-scale]] [[toy soldier]]s. The original Atlantic company ceased to exist in 1984; in the late 1990s, the "Atlantic" brand and logo were acquired by [[Nexus Editrice]].

==History==
Atlantic began producing toy soldiers in the late 1960s, achieving a great popularity in 1971 with the HO scale plastic toy soldier series "Soldati d'Italia" ("Italian soldiers") dedicated to the different branches of the contemporary [[Italian army]]. Based on this success, the company began creating series for the [[World War II]] armies and other historical periods, including the [[American Old West]], the [[Roman Empire]], and [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticsoldierreview.com/ManufacturerList.aspx?id=4 Atlantic Listing] at Plastic Soldier Review&lt;/ref&gt; The HO toy soldier line was complemented with a vast series of vehicles, from [[tank]]s to [[heavy bomber]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticmania.com/IT/Eserciti%20della%20II%20Guerra%20Mondiale.htm WWII series, including vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as buildings (for example, a miniature [[Colosseum]] was created for the Roman Empire toy soldier series).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticmania.com/IT/Serie%201500%20playsets.htm Ancient World buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from 1978, Atlantic also commercialized [[science fiction]] toy soldier lines, some of which based on [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' and ''[[Grendizer]]''.

Besides toy soldiers, Atlantic produced "[[Giocagoal]]" (a cheaper version of ''[[Subbuteo]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalpics.it/Soldatini-Atlantic/site/Serie/Giochi/GGoal.html Fansite on Giocagoal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032025/http://www.digitalpics.it/Soldatini-Atlantic/site/Serie/Giochi/GGoal.html |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Superbasket (board game)|Superbasket]]" (an action figure-based [[board game]] of [[basketball]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalpics.it/Soldatini-Atlantic/site/Serie/Giochi/Bskt.html Fansite on Superbasket] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722031954/http://www.digitalpics.it/Soldatini-Atlantic/site/Serie/Giochi/Bskt.html |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticmania.com/IT/Caratteristiche%20Superbasket.htm Superbasket] at AtlanticMania&lt;/ref&gt; a series of science fiction [[action figure]]s known as "[[Atlantic Galaxy]]", a few [[board game]]s, and other minor toy lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticmania.com/IT/Produzione.htm Extended listing of Atlantic products] at AtlanticMania&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlantic ceased creating new lines in 1978; for a few years, it marketed reprints of its classical lines (mostly in scale 1:72) made with plastic leftovers and sold in cheaper packages.&lt;ref name="plus"&gt;[http://www.atlanticplus.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984 all production ceased. Reportedly, most Atlantic toy molds were sold to an [[Iraq]]i toy company and later got lost or destroyed during the [[First Gulf War]].&lt;ref name="plus"/&gt; A few of the molds were acquired by boardgame and toy manufacturer [[Nexus Editrice]], that began creating quality reprints (mostly for the collectors' market) in 1998 and published the [[miniature wargaming|miniature wargame]] "Atlantic Wars" based on Atlantic toy soldiers. Nexus currently owns the Atlantic brand and logo.

[[File:Australian Recording Industry Association Logo.png|thumb|ARIA logo]]

The '''Australian Recording Industry Association''' ('''ARIA''') is a [[trade group]] representing the Australian recording industry which was established in 1983 by six major record companies, [[EMI]], [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival]], [[Sony Music|CBS]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|RCA]], [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and [[Polygram|Universal]] replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.&lt;ref name="AARM"&gt;{{cite book|title=The book of Australia : almanac 1997–98|editor=Siobhan O'Connor|page=515|year=1997|origyear=1990|location=[[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain, NSW]]|publisher=Ken Fin: Watermark Press for Social Club Books|isbn=1-875973-71-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It oversees the collection, administration and distribution of music [[license]]s and [[royalties]].

The association has more than 100 members, including small labels typically run by one to five people, medium size organisations and very large companies with international affiliates. ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small.

==History==
In 1956, the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) was formed by Australia's major record companies.&lt;ref name="AARM"/&gt; It was replaced in 1983 by the Australian Recording Industry Association, which was established by the six major record companies operating in Australia, [[EMI]] (now part of [[Universal Music Group]]), [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], CBS (now known as [[Sony Music]]), RCA (now part of Sony Music), WEA (now known as [[Warner Music Group]]) and [[Polygram]] (now known as Universal). It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members. By 1997, the six major labels provided 90% of all recordings made in Australia.&lt;ref name="AARM"/&gt; ARIA is administered by a Board of Directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small. As of October 2010, the directors were Denis Handlin ([[chairperson|chair]], CEO of Sony Music), George Ash (Universal Music), Mark Poston (EMI), Sebastian Chase (MGM Distribution), David Vodica (Rubber Records/Music) and Tony Harlow (WAR).&lt;ref name="BoD"/&gt;

Australian TV [[pop music]] show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' presented its own annual awards ceremony, [[Australian pop music awards#1981–1986: Countdown Music and Video Awards|''Countdown'' Music and Video Awards]], which was co-produced by Carolyn James (a.k.a. Carolyn Bailey) during 1981–1984 in collaboration with ARIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wam.asn.au/wamifest05-media.htm |title=WAM Scene |publisher=Western Australia Music Industry Association Incorporated |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720003842/http://www.wam.asn.au/wamifest05-media.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countdown.interactive.net.au/the_show.asp |title=The ''Countdown'' Story |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725080219/http://countdown.interactive.net.au/the_show.asp |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quirks"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-quirks-that-made-it-work/2006/08/04/1154198331689.html |title=The quirks that made it work |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while ''Countdown'' provided coupons in the related ''Countdown Magazine'' for viewers to vote for populist awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.countdownmemories.com/magazines/pdfs/1986_01.pdf|title=''Countdown Magazine''|date=January 1986|format=PDF|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1985 ''Countdown'' awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of [[INXS]] and [[Uncanny X-Men (band)|Uncanny X-Men]] scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.&lt;ref name="Quirks"/&gt;

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) announced its own legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

In 2006, ARIA formed sponsorship deals with [[Motorola]] and [[Nova (radio network)|Nova]] and changed the appearance and conduct of the charting. Motorola took naming-rights sponsorship seeing the charts referred to in the media as the Motorola ARIA Charts. ARIA, have commented that as part of the same marketing printed charts would be reintroduced into media retailing shops and their website would be redesigned. As part of the deal Nova began broadcasting the charted singles in reverse order on a Sunday afternoon show before it was released on the ARIA charts website.

==ARIA Charts==
{{main|ARIA Charts}}
The '''ARIA Charts''' is the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling [[Single (music)|singles]] and [[album]]s in various genres. All charts are compiled from data of both physical and digital sales from retailers in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-howare-chartsprepared.htm |title=How are the ARIA Charts prepared each week? |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association |accessdate=30 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126041502/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-howare-chartsprepared.htm |archivedate=26 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ARIA Awards==

===ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards===
The '''ARIA No.&amp;nbsp;1 Chart Awards''' were established in 2002 to recognise Australian recording artists, who reached number one on the ARIA albums, singles and music DVDs charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm |title=ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards (1 July 2005) |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association |accessdate=30 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215043454/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIANo.1ChartAwards1July2005.htm |archivedate=15 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARIA Music Awards===
{{main|ARIA Music Awards}}
The '''ARIA Music Awards''' is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] industry. The event has been held annually since 1987; it encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards known as the '''ARIA Awards''', as well as the Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Lifetime Achievement Awards and the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] (held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011).

==Criticisms==
Like most recording industry associations, ARIA has been criticised for fighting [[copyright infringement]] matters aggressively, although in Australia this has largely taken the form of aggressive advertising campaigns particularly in cinemas directly preceding movies. This criticism is stauncher in Australia due to the absence of an equivalent [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] or state crimes acts which clearly establish copyright infringement as a crime.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
&lt;!-- This is not entirely correct, as Australia does have an amendment act to the copyright act which covers digital intellectual property, someone with exact knowledge of this should add information regarding it --&gt;

In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) took legal action against [[Kazaa]], alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two [[Sharman Networks]] executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The ARIA charts have also been criticised as an easily manipulated market tool abused by aggressively marketed pop acts. "Gold" and "Platinum" ARIA awards are based on units shipped to retail outlets, not on how many of those units are sold to customers. A lukewarm album or single release can achieve Gold or Platinum status by flooding the market with copies, and if 99% are returned to the manufacturer that in no way affects the status of the award.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

ARIA has been criticised by former ''[[Australian Idol]]'' judge and record producer [[Ian Dickson (music mogul)|Ian Dickson]] for a perceived intolerance of ''Australian Idol'' contestants, and a lack of nomination in the [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Bernard | last=Zuel | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/will-idol-graduates-ever-get-any-respect/2007/09/05/1188783289280.html?page=fullpage | title=Scarlet letters | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AutoAlliance Thailand''' ('''AAT''') is the name of a [[joint venture]] automobile assembly firm co-owned by [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Mazda|Mazda Motor Corporation]] in [[Rayong province]], [[Thailand]]. Modeled after the Ford-Mazda [[AutoAlliance International]] joint venture in the United States, AAT builds compact [[pickup truck]]s and [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s primarily for the South-East Asian market, with exports to other developing markets, and Europe as well.

The factory in Thailand is designed to be similar to Mazda's [[Hofu]] plant, and is arranged as four squares.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==History==
Ford's sales in Thailand began in 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=9729 |title=Highlights of Ford Thailand |work=Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=1998-07-01 |accessdate=2012-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320093757/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=9729 |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], but it was only in 1961 that Ford began construction there. '''Anglo-Thai Motors Company''', Ford’s distributor (which sold [[Ford of Europe]] and [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford of Australia]] products), announced in 1960 that it would build a factory in the country, with '''Thai Motor Company''' the result. This was the first time automobiles had been built in Thailand - [[Ford Cortina]]s were assembled locally using components shipped in from the UK. Mazda first began exporting utility vehicles to Thailand in 1950. In 1974 '''Sukosol &amp; Mazda Motor Industry''' was founded, opening Mazda's first knock-down assembly plant in 1975.&lt;ref name=MZ33&gt;{{citation | title = Mazda News  No. 33 | publisher = Toyo Kogyo Co. | location = Hiroshima, Japan | page = 5 |date=April 1975 | editor-first = Yasuhisa | editor-last = Minagawa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford brought Thai Motor under the corporate umbrella in 1973, but closed the factory just three years later.  Company presence returned in 1985 with the formation of '''New Era Company''' to push cars and trucks in the country.

Construction on the new AutoAlliance plant began on November 28, 1995, and the plant began mass production on May 29, 1998.  The grand opening ceremony on July 1, 1998, included [[Chuan Leekpai]], the then-prime minister of Thailand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Backsourcing''' is the process of bringing previously [[outsourcing|outsourced]] jobs back under the roof of the company to be performed internally. 

Backsourcing has been increasingly discussed as companies decide to cease outsourcing operations, whether because of the problems with the outsourcing agreements, because of the pressure to bring jobs back to their home country, or simply because it has stopped being efficient to outsource particular tasks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissmc.ch/documents/Beardsell_Julie_working_paper_012010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Backsourcing is sometimes confused with ''[[insourcing]]''. However, insourcing simply refers to conducting certain activities in-house (whether or not by a third party),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plunkettresearch.com/outsourcing-offshoring-bpo-market-research/industry-and-business-data&lt;/ref&gt; while backsourcing refers to bringing ''previously outsourced activities'' back in-house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16456">'''Business relations''' are connections between [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in the process of businesses, such as [[employer]]–[[employee]] relationships, managers as well as outsourced [[business partner]]s. The association of businesses began relationships which have been constructed through communication channels such as the likes of [[telephone]]s, personal contacts, and [[e-mail]]s. These types of contacts  are maintained and deepened through similar channels in internal businesses and organizations.

Within the business of this era, the aim of many businesses whether small or internationally established is to develop a target to [[motivation|motivate]] all types of employees to form a professional relationship with one-another which will have many benefits to the business which will strongly lead to success. Furthermore, external business relationships are essential to any organization as it will improve the companies image, develop [[brand loyalty]], and improve sales.

There are many different forms through which business relations are maintained. Primarily, these relations as stated previously, constructed through [[communication]] channels however face-to-face interactions and the [[social media]] are seen to be the most effective allowing people to form stronger ties. There have been many research studies suggesting that multiple modes of communication are important to build strong business relationships. Face-to-face interactions are typically the most effective due to the in-person communication aspect, as it allows people to form stronger ties. The more communication and interaction there is  between two entities, the stronger the business relationship builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smallbiztrends.com/2015/06/build-lasting-business-relationships.html|title=11 Ways to Build Solid, Lasting Business Relationships - Small Business Trends|website=smallbiztrends.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, internal business relations are important to maintain, as loyal employees can benefit the business by increasing profits. Moreover, loyal employees allow better relationships to be established with key suppliers and distributors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=W.Y. Yee|first1=Rachel|last2=Yeung|first2=Andy C.L.|last3=Cheng|first3=T.C. Edwin|title=An empirical study of employee loyalty, service quality and firm performance in the service industry.|journal=international journal of Production economics|date=2010|volume=1|issue=124|pages=109–120|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the business will be able to retain its [[customer satisfaction]] which will influence the service quality. Commitments of employees is therefore highly recommended for further positive influence on the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The new age employee: An exploration of changing employee-organization relations.|last = Mir|first = Ali|date = 2002|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = 10.1177/009102600203100205|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Raza|first2 = Mir|issue = 2|pages = 187–200|last3 = Mosca|first3 = Joseph B.|volume = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Importance Of Loyalty and Trust in a Business ==

Business relations are important both externally and internally. Research has shown that "trust" is one of the most critical factors to develop and enhance effective long-term relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yimin|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Ian F.|title=The dynamics and evolution of trust in business relationships|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=April 2013|volume=42|issue=3|pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether its with other business networks, individuals in a partnered firm or employees within the organization; who with a strong positive relationship can increase one or more of the following; long-term [[stock market]], [[employment rate]], [[productivity]], overall performance and other measures as  stated, with companies that are more aware and engaged with [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] matters, leading to a better performance level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karnes|first1=Roger Eugene|title=A Change in Business Ethics: The Impact on Employer–Employee Relations|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=12 August 2008|volume=87|issue=2|pages=189–197|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9878-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, researchers of organizational behavior stress about organizational effectiveness being linked with employee's attribution. Therefore, creating an environment with employee satisfaction will hinder and solve such disagreements and arguments between one employee to another and the data will significantly preferable.

Moreover, as the business environment is constantly changing, it is causing firms to address new entrepreneurial innovative ideas that could out-stand them from the [[competition]]. Trust plays an important role in this as with developed business relations it allows one to react and initiate such innovative ideas to the business more effectively. There are two different types of trust that exists between business relations that affect one another, firstly " interpersonal" which refers to the individuals trust in one organization on other in the partnered organization. Secondly " inter organizational " which refers to members from the organization having a collective orientation or culture of trust towards a partner in a different organization.

With loyalty established internally in the organization and the employer aims and directs constant communication, the employer will form a strong relationship and bond between the employees and organizations; allowing them to feel more attached and sense commitment. This will result in a more motivated group of employees that will deliver high-quality services which is one of the key characteristics of  "[[social exchange]]". Delivering high quality services is essential as it allows organizations to gain customer satisfaction which gives a positive impact on the firm as customer satisfaction boosts [[customer loyalty]] and future behaviors. Customers become less concerned and sensitive towards prices as by being satisfied they tend to pay and tolerate such an increase in prices which in the long-term establishes a positive reputation as well as increasing the economic performance of the firm. Therefore, loyalty is essential in order to gain a strong employee relationship which can link to having a better customer loyalty, with time resulting in a more organized business that has a good flow of communication both internally and externally.

== Communication and Its Effect On Business Relations ==

Communication contact plays an important role in re-shaping the internal and external management in the organization. Communication cooperation internally can encourage " processes, strategies, activities, policies and programs" to be developed which enforce information and communication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisner|first1=Joel D.|last2=Stanley|first2=Linda L.|title=Internal Relationships and Activities Associated with High Levels of Purchasing Service Quality|journal=The Journal of Supply Chain Management|date=June 1999|volume=35|issue=3|pages=25–32|doi=10.1111/j.1745-493X.1999.tb00059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will have an effect on external relations which is considered to be rather important. Furthermore, establishing good communications at the beginning of the business between the employees, will provide the business with a positive reputation in the industry towards its rivalries and competitors in the market. Therefore, this could be constructed though the use of effective training programs and measurement systems.

Focusing on the internal aspect of communications, will allow external networks to trust the business by having the right perspective on the processes which may occur. This is due to the fact that communication is vital to sustain, especially when partnering with another company; whether its through [[mergers and acquisitions|merging]] or just joining a particular project. Therefore, the ability of associating with the right businesses is relevant in order to keep the company more innovative; as networks allow for " an effective transfer of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geigenmüller|first1=Anja|last2=Mitręga|first2=Maciej|title=Network partner knowledge and internal relationships influencing customer relationship quality and company performance|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing|date=27 July 2012|volume=27|issue=6|pages=486–496|doi=10.1108/08858621211251488}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by gaining connections through networks; it can provide employee's, managers or owners to develop personal networks that can benefit oneself in the long term whether its towards a new entrepreneurial business plan, a project or even an incident that may occur within the business. An example is an entrepreneurial designer who used his personal connections in the industry to seek a potential supplier in China to continue developing his new business plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ian F.|last2=Young|first2=Louise C.|title=Innovation and Evolution of Business Relations and Networks: Theory and Method |arxiv=1203.1332|date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes on why obtaining and sustaining relations is beneficial for a business. Moreover, communication links with relationship marketing perfectly as both focus towards activities directed as establishing, developing and maintaining successful exchanges with customers and other constituents. (Morgan and Hunt 1994).

On the other hand, even though communication is a key concept to any business. Organizations should not fully depend on establishing only a few relations and shutting down others that may be beneficial, due to the fact that networking and developing relationships should not have limits. Engaging with new businesses frequently can provide positive change within the business by introducing new concepts and innovative ideas that keep up with the changes that take place in the industry regularly. Thus, businesses should accept some new organizations as well as keep close to old ones in order to sustain its position in the industry and adapt to the changes that take place.

To further extend, there are multiple ways of communicating within a business to improve relations whether its through technology, discussions in the office or through annual reports. More specifically, organizations are recommending the use of technological devices such a videoconferencing and teleconferencing which allows individuals to not be present at the same place but still be able to interact with one another, similarly the use of laptops and such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Dave|last2=Raffo|first2=Carlo|last3=Anderton|first3=Alain|title=Business studies.|date=2008|publisher=Causeway|location=Ormskirk|isbn=9781405892315|pages=446–455|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners and managers consequently highlight the importance of communication in the business, especially in large organizations as there are longer layers in the [[hierarchy]] as well as more commitment.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''The effect of Social Media on business relationships'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''''

Nowadays, Social Media plays an important role in establishing relationships. It is reported that there  is 1.5 billion social media users globally, with at least 70% of companies using some form of social media ([[McKinsey Global Institute]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The social economy: Unlocking value and productivity through social technologies|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy|website = www.mckinsey.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many connections can be constructed through organizations  such as “ [[LinkedIn]]” where one can form new relations that can be beneficial in the longterm and contacts are usually made between individuals from different businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The art of business relationships through social media {{!}} Ivey Business Journal|url = http://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/the-art-of-business-relationships-through-social-media/|website = iveybusinessjournal.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Millennials|millennial generation]] more specifically are actively involved with social media on a daily basis and with the continuous change that is occurring in the industry, social media is essential for improving business performance and helping firms achieve a [[competitive advantage]]. In addition, (Cross and Katzenbach 2012 ) found that 90% of the information used for decision making came from informal networks rather than formal reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cross|first1=Rob|last2=Katzenbach|first2=Jon|title=The Right Role for Top Teams|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00103?gko=97c39|website=www.strategy-business.com/|publisher=Strategy and Leadership|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with Different Business Sizes ==

Business relations within a small organization differs from the regular as it is a mix of both formal and informal management. However, this depends on the internal management and more specifically the owners/managers own personal preferences. Even though this style of management is seen to be less flexible, it is more beneficial towards expanding in size and profitability. Many believe that with owners/managers, having both a formal and informal approach operations will occur more efficiently; resulting with a better positive outcome causing growth, an increase in profitability and a positive reputation between other competitors in the market, which is what every small business intends to achieve. In addition, small business control more than half of the market but many are seen to fail due to poor planning and inefficient external business relations.

Small businesses external relations are essential for success, an external relationship is defined as " a commercially oriented connected between a small business and other two organizations". The most known types are alliances and networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Street|first1=Christopher T.|last2=Cameron|first2=Ann-Frances|title=External Relationships and the Small Business: A Review of Small Business Alliance and Network Research*|journal=Journal of Small Business Management|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=2|pages=239–266|doi=10.1111/j.1540-627X.2007.00211.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a relationship based on mutual interests and benefits as well as forming relationships within different organizations together into one. An example of forming an external relationship based on networking is engaging with a foreign organization, to increase financial gain and [[market share]] within the industry.This emphasizes the importance of forming external relationships, as this can push the business into having a more effective; higher position in the market, ahead of its competitors with greater brand awareness and recognition. Small businesses have a difficult time building good business relations as business relations is connected with such marketing performances and the need of having a good starting profit, time, planning and marketing expertise, therefore establishing strong external social ties from different organizations can strengthen the overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamprinopoulou|first1=Chrysoula|last2=Tregear|first2=Angela|title=Inter‐firm relations in SME clusters and the link to marketing performance|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing|date=2 August 2011|volume=26|issue=6|pages=421–429|doi=10.1108/08858621111156412}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinelli''' ({{IPA-it|tʃiˈnɛlli}}) is an Italian bicycle manufacturing company based in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], producing mostly road bicycles and components; production is estimated at 80 percent components, 20 percent bicycles.

== History ==

[[File:Cinelli 1965 SC 1 (26292204880).jpg|thumb|Cinelli SC 1965]]
[[File:Cinelli Mash Histogram 2012.jpg|thumb|Cinelli Mash Histogram 2012]]
Cinelli was founded in 1948 by [[Cino Cinelli]] (born [[Montespertoli]], Italy, 9 February 1916, died 20 April 2001), a former professional road racer and president of the Italian Cyclists' Association.  He was a professional racer from 1937 to 1944, winning [[Milan–San Remo]] in 1943, the [[Giro di Lombardia]] in 1938, and the Tour of the Apennines in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/CyclismeFicheCoureur1655.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He started a company under his name in 1948.

Cinelli was the seventh of 10 children, the son of a small landowner near [[Florence]].&lt;ref name = Herlihy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/oralhistory/Cinelli%20interview.html
| title = A Visit With Cino Cinelli
| last = Herlihy
| first = David V
| authorlink = David V. Herlihy
| publisher = Race Bike Info
| accessdate = 2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in bicycle technology after mechanical failures in races. Failure to interest manufacturers with his ideas in 1946 led him to start his own company. His brother Giotto was making steel stems and bars in Florence and Cinelli moved the business to [[Milan]],  centre of the Italian cycling industry. He made stems, bars and frames but depended on wholesaling for other companies. By his retirement, Cinelli's own goods were half the business. Stems and bars were 80 percent of Cinelli's own sales.

Cinelli moved to alloy production in 1963, later than other manufacturers because he was concerned about strength.&lt;ref name = Herlihy/&gt; Annual production of alloy stems and bars rose from 5,000 in the 1950s, to 7,500 in the early 1960s. By 1978 the figure was 150,000. He made no more than 700 frames a year. In 1974, he designed an aerodynamic bike on which [[Ole Ritter]] broke his own hour record. The staple product was the Speciale Corsa road model made from 1947. The Speciale Corsa also became known as the "Super Corsa" after a supplier sent decals that erroneously said "Super Corsa" instead of "Speciale Corsa."&lt;ref name = Ebykr&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ebykr.com/2005/11/27/cinelli/| title = The Quiet Warrior: Cino Cinelli and the History of Innovation| publisher = Ebykr| accessdate = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinelli recently teamed up with San Francisco-based MashSF to create the popular "Cinelli MASH" frames, which are widely used in the fixed-gear culture.

== Trade mark ==

[[File:Cinelli Head Badge.jpg|thumb|upright|Cinelli [[head badge]]]]
The Cinelli (MILANO) [[head badge]] was originally cloisonne (fired glass on brass) and 55mm tall. Shortly thereafter (c.1953) it was hand-painted with enamel and 56mm tall. In approximately 1958 it was reduced in height to 51mm. In 1978, it became a decal. The design featured a knight's helmet, inspired by a family heirloom, with a red lily -   symbol of Florence - and a green serpent, symbol of Milan.

== Company ownership ==
The presidency of the company passed to Antonio Colombo, owner of [[Columbus tubing]], in 1978.  In 1997 Cinelli became a division of Gruppo S.r.l.

'''CoSTUME NATIONAL''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] fashion house founded in 1986 by [[Ennio Capasa]], Creative Director, and his brother Carlo, CEO of the Maison, which has its head offices in [[Milan]]. The company produces clothing under the brands ''Costume National'', ''Costume National Homme'' (for men) and ''C’N’C'' (an ‘avant garde “street-couture” line’&lt;ref name="imagesfashion"&gt;[http://www.imagesfashion.com/NewsDetails.aspx?Ntype=2&amp;id=247 ‘Sequedge and Costume National Join Hands’], imagesfashion.com, 24 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as scents including ''The Trilogy'', ''Scent Gloss'', ''Scent Cool Gloss'', ''Intense'', ''21'', and ''Homme''.

==History==
The company was founded in 1986 in Milan by Ennio Capasa, fresh from working in [[Japan]] as an assistant to [[Yohji Yamamoto]], and his brother Carlo Capasa. Its first womenswear collection was presented in Milan in the same year. In 1991 the ‘Woman Collection’ was presented in [[Paris]]. Between 1995 and 1998 the [[fashion house]] opened stores in Milan, [[New York City]], [[Rome]], [[Los Angeles]] and Paris.

In 2000 a menswear collection was streamed online in collaboration with [[Kataweb]]. Over the following three years the company extended its range of products to include [[perfume]]s, [[eyewear]], [[ready to wear]] apparel and [[footwear]], plus [[Fashion accessory|accessories]] targeted at the younger generations.

==Distribution and Production==

===Costume National===

The company’s Thiene factory is responsible for the men's and women’s Ready To Wear production. The factory is mainly responsible for cutting-room, pattern-making and finished product quality control.
CN Shoes factory, based in Fossò, develops and produces footwear. 
Leather bags and leather accessories are produced by selected partners and commercialised by CN Production.
Leather clothing production is licensed to Leather Company, that works in exclusive for Costume National. 
Costume National has 5 flagship stores which were designed with the same concept of classical  edginess and minimalism. 
in October 2008 Costume National launched its online store where the Costume National and Costume National Homme collections and accessories are available.

===C’N’C Costume National===

C’N’C Costume National, produced and distributed through a licensing agreement with ITTIERRE, offers Ready To Wear apparel for Men and Women as well as footwear and accessories.
PLUS IT, the accessories division which features shoes, bags and a line of small accessories, also has a worldwide distribution network. 
The production facilities are located in Italy, while the distribution has a worldwide network.

==Collaborations and Co-branding==
In 2005 Ennio Capasa created the DUCATI Black Dogo: a motorcycle similar to the Argentine mastiff it got its name from. This collaboration allowed him to design a series of special items of clothing under the C’N’C Costume National [[Ducati]] label.

To celebrate its 21st anniversary in 2007, the company presented the book ''21'' (a photographic journal of Capasa’s career), a version of the [[Absolut Vodka]] bottle dressed in black vinyl with images of two catwomen, the Alfa 147 C’N’C 21 (a limited edition car costume), a unisex fragrance called ‘Costume National 21’, and a line of luxury sneakers under the name ‘Costume National Active’.

During [[Milan Design Week]] of 2009 the Dutch designer [[Maarten Baas]] presented his show-event entitled “Real Time” in the C’N’C Costume National showroom.  C’N’C Costume National showed the SS2010 Collection in Piazza Duomo in front of 40.000 guests, rather than to a limitied number of ‘those who are active in the industry’. To celebrate Christmas 2009 the company participated in the [[Water Project]], an [[Amref]] initiative.

In 2010 C’N’C Costume National showed the FW2010/2011 Collection at the Teatro dell’Arte of the Triennale di Milano.

==Eco-projects==
In 2009 the company’s ‘Solar Bag’, which featured [[solar panel]]s which charged a battery  concealed in the lining able to supply power to [[mobile phone]]s, [[iPod]]s and other digital accessories, received the “[[Chi é Chi Award]]” for the best eco-friendly fashion product. In 2008 Ennio Capasa designed a limited edition t-shirt to support the Climate Project, an [[Al Gore]] initiative. To celebrate Christmas 2008 Costume National collaborated with [[Planete Urgence]],&lt;!--(www.planete-urgence.org)--&gt; an organization dedicated to environmental and social change, in a ‘Plant a Tree’ project.

'''Dow Corning''' was&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dowdupont-m-a/dowdupont-alters-post-merger-breakup-plans-amid-investor-pressure-idUSKCN1BN15F&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plastverarbeiter.de/74087/dowdupont-gibt-namen-der-kuenftigen-drei-divisionen-bekannt/&lt;/ref&gt; an American [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Midland, Michigan]], United States. Originally established as a joint venture between the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[Corning Inc.|Corning Incorporated]], it is now owned by [[DowDuPont]] and specializes in [[silicone]] and [[silicon]]-based technology, and is the largest silicone product producer in the world.&lt;ref name=jv/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dow Corning, Bay City.jpg|thumb|right|Dow Corning, Bay City]]
Dow Corning was formally established in 1943 as a [[joint venture]] between the American conglomerates [[Dow Chemical]] and [[Corning Glass]] to explore the potential of silicone and was a manufacturer of products for use by the U.S. military in World War II. The company began operating its first plant, in Midland, MI, in 1945. Dr. E. C. Sullivan was named president, and  Dr. William R. Collings was named general manager in 1943. Dr. Collings later became president from 1954 until 1962.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; It expanded into Canada and Europe in 1948, and into South America and Japan in 1961.&lt;ref name= 'timeline'&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan-based Dow Corning: Timeline of a global success story|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/mid-michigan/index.ssf/2014/11/dow_corning_timeline.html|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large, majority-owned subsidiary of Dow Corning Corporation is the [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation]].&lt;ref name=jv&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Westervelt |coauthors= |title=Dow Corning |url=http://www.chemweek.com/dowcorning2011/ |quote=Dow Corning, a 50–50 jv between Dow Chemical and Corning, is the world’s largest silicones producer and has a controlling 62.5% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor (Hemlock, MI), the world’s leading producer of polysilicon used in semiconductor and solar wafer production. ... |newspaper=[[Chemical Week]] |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the world's largest producers of high-purity polycrystalline silicon, which is sold in varying purity grades for use in both [[semiconductor]] [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] manufacture and [[photovoltaics]] applications as solar cells.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;

In 2002, the company created the Xiameter brand as an online-only distributor. As of 2011, Xiameter offers 2,100 of Dow Corning’s 7,000 products.

On November 13, 2014, Dow Chemical's CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]] revealed in a presentation to investors that Corning Incorporated intended to exit the joint venture of 71 years, citing other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Says Corning Wants to Exit 71-Year-Old Venture|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-13/dow-says-corning-wants-to-exit-71-year-old-venture.html|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Bloomberg News|publisher=Bloomberg|first=Jack|last=Kaskey|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the December 11, 2015 announcement that it would merge with [[DuPont]], Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning's stake in Dow Corning in exchange for $4.8 billion in cash and Corning gaining a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation. Dow Chemical assumed full ownership of Dow Corning on June 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corning to Swap Stake In Dow Corning For $4.8 Billion, Semiconductor Stake|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corning-to-sell-stake-in-dow-corning-venture-for-4-8-billion-1449846313|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=wsj.com|publisher=wsj.com|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg-dowdemerge&gt;{{cite news|title=Dow Chemical to Take Full Control of Dow Corning Venture|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-11/dow-chemical-takes-100-percent-stake-in-dow-corning-venture|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=Bloomberg News|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Dow Corning markets over 7000 products include various sealants, adhesives, rubbers, lubricants, silicon oils and solvents. Around 2,100 of these are available through the Dow Corning online-only distributor Xiameter, including fluids, gels, resins. The range of industries targeted by Dow Corning products spans from electronics and automotive to construction, healthcare and others. In recent years, the company has expanded production of solar cells, particularly through its majority stake in [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation|Hemlock]], which accounts for a polysilicon franchise worth over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dow Corning: Solar, Sustainability Drive Turnaround|url=http://www.chemweek.com/dowcorning2011/|website=IHS Chemical Week Magazine|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, then-CTO Gregg Zank explained that the company tries to focus its product development on societal “megatrends” (e.g. energy scarcity and urbanization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation in chemicals: An interview with Dow Corning’s CEO and CTO|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/energy_resources_materials/innovation_in_chemicals_an_interview_with_dow_cornings_ceo_and_cto|website=McKinsey’s &amp; Company|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with breast implants==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, [[class action|class-action]] lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/24bn-breastimplant-offer-1247358.html independent.co.uk – $2.4bn breast-implant offer], 1997-08-26&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Dow Corning's silicone [[breast implant]]s caused systemic health problems. The claims first centered on [[breast cancer]] and then migrated to a range of [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]s, including [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 multibillion-dollar class action settlement.&lt;ref name = frontline&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/implants/cron.html Chronology of silicone breast implants]. ''Frontline''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Dow Corning was in [[bankruptcy]] protection for nine years, ending in June 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v082n015.p005| title = Out of the Woods| journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News| volume = 82| issue = 15| pages = 5| year = 2004| last1 = Reisch | first1 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time it largely withdrew from clinical markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v071n002.p013| title = Dow Corning Moving Back on Track Following Breast Implant Controversy| journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News| volume = 71| issue = 2| pages = 13| year = 1993| last1 = Reisch | first1 = M.

Although a number of independent reviews, including the [[National Academy of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] in the United States, subsequently indicated that silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancers or any identifiable systemic diseases,&lt;ref name = nyt&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Gina Kolata]] |coauthors= |title=Panel Confirms No Major Illness Tied to Implants |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B03E6D9103BF932A15755C0A96F958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fI%2fInstitute%20of%20Medicine |quote=An independent panel of 13 scientists convened by the Institute of Medicine at the request of Congress has concluded that silicone breast implants do not cause any major diseases. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 21, 1999 |accessdate=2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1933 he co-founded the local branch of the Norwegian Fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]] in [[Hamar]]. He became the city leader ([[Führer]]), whereas townsman [[Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie (Nazi)|Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie]] became county leader. Compared to elsewhere in Norway, the party was relatively successful in Hamar, winning two [[municipal council (Norway)|city council]] seats in its first election outing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gjerdåker|first=Brynjulv|title=Stiftstad og bygdeby.

On 9 April 1940 Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by Nazi Germany]]. During the [[German occupation of Norway|subsequent occupation]], Fasting was installed by the Germans as mayor of Hamar on 1 January 1941. In July 1941 he was installed as chairman of [[Hamar, Vang og Furnes Kommunale Kraftselskap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandberg|first=Per-Øivind|title=Hamar-regionen Energiverk 1913–1988|year=1988|publisher=Hamar-regionen Energiverk|location=Hamar|language=Norwegian|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, Fasting was removed from his positions, and was arrested in May 1945. In the post-war [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Norwegian legal purge]] he was tried for treason, and in [[Hamar District Court|Hamar City Court]] he was sentenced to nine years of prison in October 1946. His case was finally decided in the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] in December 1948, where his sentence was reduced to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Gjerdåker 1998, pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1958.&lt;ref name=disn/&gt;

'''Elspeth Cantlie Kennedy''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO|MBE|size=85%}} (born '''Elsie Cantlie Myron'''; 3 April 1931 – 8 January 2017) was a New Zealand sharebroker and community leader. She was the first woman in New Zealand to be elected as a member of a metropolitan stock exchange, and the first to run her own broking firm. Kennedy chaired the Nelson Tasman Hospice Trust from 1998 to 2014.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Invercargill]] on 3 April 1931 as Elsie Cantlie Myron, she was  educated at [[Southland Girls' High School]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Alister |title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 1994|year=1994|publisher=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa |location=Auckland |isbn=0-908578-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She showed early business acumen, running her grandfather's coal retailing business when she was just 17 years old, and then worked at the Invercargill City Council where she became credit manager at the age of 20 years.&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt; In 1952 Kennedy went to Britain to study singing, qualiifying as a [[Trinity College London|Fellow of Trinity College London]].&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt; Returning to New Zealand, Kennedy later settled in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in the 1970s, where she taught at the Nelson School of Music.&lt;ref name="Bulls"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson Mail 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/779837/Award-honours-entire-hospice-team | title=Award 'honours entire hospice team' | date=31 December 2008 | work=Nelson Mail | accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married James Kennedy-Simpson. The couple had three children but later divorced.&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt;

==Sharebroking career==
In 1979 Kennedy was employed by [[Frank Renouf]] as the local-body specialist at his [[Wellington]] sharebroking firm, and three years later she became the first woman in New Zealand to become a member of a metropolitan stock exchange when she was elected to the Wellington Exchange. Kennedy joined Francis Allison Symes in 1984, establishing that firm's local authority money market.  She was the first New Zealand woman, in January 1987, to establish her own brokerage firm, Kennedy Sharebrokers, which merged with Main Corporation later that year.&lt;ref name="Bulls"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=David |title=Bulls, Bears and Elephants: A History of the New Zealand Stock Exchange |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=GljzNcev1AEC |accessdate=12 January 2017 |year=1997 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington |isbn=0-86473-308-9 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry (FESI)''' is a [[Brussels]]-based European platform representing the interests of some 1,800 European [[sporting goods]] manufacturers before the [[European institutions|European Institutions]], Sport Governing bodies such as [[UEFA]] and  other international sport federations or associations. It is also the founder of the House of Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fesi-sport.org/content/house-sport|title=The House of Sport - Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry (FESI)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it (together with nineteen partners) - plays a crucial role in raising awareness on the benefits of sports and physical activity through cross-sectoral cooperation. Note that since 2015 FESI is also an official partner of the European Week of Sport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/week/|title=European Week of Sport 2016 #BeActive - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (EWOS).

The association aims to provide opportunities for sporting goods companies to collaborate on non-commercial pre-competitive issues of common interest, monitor legislative initiatives relating to the sporting goods industry at a European level, advocate for the sporting goods industry in Brussels, and communicate with European stakeholders about issues from trade and the [[supply chain]], the environment and  [[product safety]]. The group also aims to promote free trade between European Member States and facilitate trade world-wide. FESI is a member of the [[World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry]] (WFSGI).

==History==

FESI was created in the early sixties with the aim of achieving [[free and fair]] trade in Europe while facilitating trade worldwide. In October 1994, FESI headquarters moved to Brussels, a strategic step which has allowed FESI to increase its [[European Union lobbying|lobbying]] and enhance its impact on European institutions.

In February 2002, during an Extraordinary General Assembly, FESI decided to allow sports manufacturers a direct voting right in its main decision bodies. Sports manufacturers can thus become FESI Regular Members in the same way as FESI's 12 National Federations.

In December 2002, following some months of consultation and negotiation, FESI and FEPI (Federation of the European Play Industry) signed a [[letter of intent]] which paved the way for a future collaboration between both organizations.

'''Krishnakumar Ramakumar''', also credited as '''Five Star Krishna''', is an Indian [[film actor]] who has appeared in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] films in supporting roles. He made his debut in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s production ''[[Five Star (film)|Five Star]]'' (2002), before playing pivotal roles in ''[[Arinthum Ariyamalum]]'' and ''[[Saravana]]''.

==Career==
Krishna, who had previously apprenticed under [[Rajiv Menon]] as an assistant director, was signed on by [[Susi Ganesan]] to appear in a leading role in ''[[Five Star (film)|Five Star]]'', produced by [[Mani Ratnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaionline.com/location/5star.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119014118/http://www.chennaionline.com/location/5star.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 November 2002|title=Five Star|publisher=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaionline.com/interviews/krishnakumar.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030225112924/http://www.chennaionline.com/interviews/krishnakumar.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2003|title=5 Star-Krishna Kumar|publisher=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portraying a runaway husband, he won rave reviews with The Hindu's critic noting "there are scenes where he could have underplayed his emotions a little&amp;nbsp;— but surely the young man has talent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/10/11/stories/2002101101170200.htm|title=The Hindu : Five Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning good reviews for his performance in ''Five Star'', Krishna followed it up playing supporting roles in films including [[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]'s ''[[Autograph (2004 film)|Autograph]]'' and as a student leader in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Aaytha Ezhuthu]]'', while also appearing as Dhanush's brother in the romantic comedy, ''[[Thiruda Thirudi]]''. He has since then notably appeared in projects directed by [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnuvardhan]], featuring in four consecutive ventures. He has balanced appearances in films alongside his advertisement agency.

In 2008, it was reported that he was set to direct a gangster film titled ''Madras'' starring Vishnuvardhan's brother [[Kreshna]] in the lead role, though the project did not materialise after a spat with the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/just-arrived/article471135.ece|title=Just arrived|author=sudhish kamath|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-04/news-interviews/28042245_1_alibaba-krishna-comedy|title=Krishna's acting hues|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/42959.html|title=Krishna to direct Krishna|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna has directed a commercial advertisement featuring [[Kamal Haasan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/kamal-to-act-in-a-commercial-advertisement-to-raise-funds-for-treatment-of-aids-patients-tamil-news-142702.html|title=Kamal to do it for the first time to help AIDS patients|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''free lunch''' is a sales enticement that offers a [[meal]] at no [[cost]] in order to attract customers and increase [[revenue]]s from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in [[Western saloon|saloons]] in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a "free" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink.&lt;ref name=south/&gt; The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.

Free food or drink is sometimes supplied in contemporary times, often by [[gambling]] establishments such as [[casino]]s.

The saying "[[there ain't no such thing as a free lunch]]" refers to this custom, meaning that things which appear to be free are always paid for in some way.

== History ==
In 1875, ''[[The New York Times]] ''wrote of elaborate free lunches as a "custom peculiar to the Crescent City" ([[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]), saying, "In every one of the drinking saloons which fill the city a meal of some sort is served free every day. The custom appears to have prevailed long before the [[American Civil War|war]].... I am informed that there are thousands of men in this city who live entirely on the meals obtained in this way." As described by this reporter,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A free lunch-counter is a great leveler of [[social class in the United States|classes]], and when a man takes up a position before one of them he must give up all hope of appearing either dignified or consequential. In New-Orleans all classes of the people can be seen partaking of these free meals and pushing and scrambling to be helped a second time. [At one saloon] six men were engaged in preparing drinks for the crowd that stood in front of the counter. I noticed that the price charged for every kind of [[liquor]] was fifteen cents, [[Punch (drink)|punches]] and cobblers costing no more than a glass of [[ale]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The repast included "immense dishes of butter," large baskets of bread, "a monster silver boiler filled with a most excellent [[oyster]] soup," "a round of beef that must have weighed at least forty pounds," vessels filled with potatoes, stewed [[mutton]], stewed tomatoes, and [[macaroni]] ''à la Français.'' The proprietor said that the patrons included "at least a dozen old fellows who come here every day, take one fifteen cent drink, eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant, and then complain that the beef is tough or the potatoes watery."&lt;ref name=south&gt;"Free Lunch in the South." The New York Times, Feb 20, 1875, p. 4. Re value of the lunch,  this source speaks of patrons who "take one fifteen cent drink [and] eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant." https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/02/20/82755928.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ($0.15 in 1875 is {{Inflation|US|0.15|1875|r=2|fmt=eq}}; $1 in 1875 is {{Inflation|US|1|1875|r=2|fmt=eq}})

== Free-lunch fiend ==
The nearly indigent "free-lunch fiend" was a recognized social type. An 1872 ''New York Times'' story about "loafers and free-lunch men" who "[[Matthew 6:28|toil not, neither do they spin]], yet they 'get along,'" visiting saloons, trying to bum drinks from strangers; "should this inexplicable lunch-fiend not happen to be called to drink, he devours whatever he can, and, while the bartender is occupied, tries to escape unnoticed."&lt;ref&gt;"The Loafer and Free-Lunch Men;" The New York Times, June 30, 1872, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[Western saloon|saloon]] bars from the late 19th century until Prohibition, [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] had, in addition to their role of removing drunks who were too intoxicated to keep buying drinks, fighters, and troublemakers, the unusual role of protecting the saloon's free buffet. To attract business, "...many saloons lured customers with offers of a "free lunch"—usually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon "bouncer" was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hoboes.com/Politics/Prohibition/Notes/Drinking/ Drinking in America: A History - Search for Consensus: Drinking and the War Against Pluralism, 1860-1920]'' – Lender, Mark Edward &amp; Martin, James Kirby, The Free Press, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom was well-developed in [[San Francisco]]. An 1886 story on the fading of the days of the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]] calls "the free lunch fiend the only landmark of the past." It asks "How do all these idle people live" and asserts, "It is the free lunch system that keeps them alive. Take away that peculiarly California institution and they would all starve."&lt;ref&gt;"Old Things Passing Away," The New York Times, March 5, 1886, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudyard Kipling]], writing in 1891, noted how he

&lt;blockquote&gt;came upon a barroom full of bad Salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter. It was the institution of the "free lunch" I had struck. You paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat. For something less than a [[rupee]] a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in San Francisco, even though he be a bankrupt. Remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rudyard|last=Kipling|title=American Notes|publisher=Standard Book Company|year=1930}} (published in book form in 1930, based on essays which appeared in periodicals in 1891)&lt;br/&gt;
{{Gutenberg|no=977|name=American Notes by Rudyard Kipling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1919 novel compared a war zone to the free lunch experience by saying "the shells and shrapnels was flyin round and over our heads thicker than hungry [[Homelessness|bum]]s around a free [[lunch counter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Love Letters of a Rookie to Julie|author=Barney Stone|year=1919|publisher=The Sherwood Company}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=15544|name=Love Letters of a Rookie to Julie by Barney Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The [[temperance movement]] opposed the free lunch as promoting the consumption of alcohol. An 1874 history of the movement writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the cities, there are prominent rooms on fashionable streets that hold out the sign "Free Lunch." Does it mean that some [philanthropist]... has gone systematically to work setting out tables... placing about them a score of the most beautiful and winning young ladies... hiring a band of music? Ah, no!... there are men who do all this in order to hide the main feature of their peculiar institution. Out of sight is a well-filled bar, which is the centre about which all these other things are made to revolve. All the gathered fascinations and attractions are as so many baits to allure men into the net that is spread for them. Thus consummate art plies the work of death, and virtue, reputation, and every good are sacrificed at these worse than [[Moloch]] shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Years History of the Temperance Cause: Intemperance the Great National Curse|first=Jane E. |last=Stebbins|author2=T. A. H. Brown|publisher=L.

A number of writers, however, suggest that the free lunch actually performed a social relief function. Reformer [[William T. Stead]] commented that in winter in 1894 the suffering of the poor in need of food
&lt;blockquote&gt;would have been very much greater had it not been for the help given by the [[labor unions]] to their members and for an agency which, without pretending to be of much account from a charitable point of view, nevertheless fed more hungry people in Chicago than all the other agencies, religious, charitable, and municipal, put together. I refer to the Free Lunch of the saloons. There are from six to seven thousand saloons in Chicago. In one half of these a free lunch is provided every day of the week.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
He states that "in many cases the free lunch is really a free lunch," citing an example of a saloon which did not insist on a drink purchase, although commenting that this saloon was "better than its neighbors." Stead cites a newspaper's estimate that the saloon keepers fed 60,000 people a day and that this represented a contribution of about $18,000 a week toward the relief of the destitute in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If Christ Came to Chicago|first=William T.|last=Stead|year=1894|publisher=[[Laird &amp; Lee]]}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC02495421&amp;id=olqCOpl4SWoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;as_brr=1 pp. 139–140]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1896, the New York State legislature passed the [[Raines law]] which was intended to regulate liquor traffic. Among its many provisions, one forbade the sale of liquor unless accompanied by food; another outlawed the free lunch. In 1897, however, it was amended to allow free lunches again.&lt;ref&gt;"Revolt in Clubdom; Probability of Passage of Amendments to Raines Law Causes Consternation; Free Lunch to Come Back."

{{japanese name|Furukawa}}
{{nihongo|'''Furukawa Ichibei'''|古河 市兵衛|extra=April 16, 1832 - April 5, 1903}} was a Japanese businessman who founded one of the fifteen largest industrial conglomerates in Japan, specializing in electrical goods, chemicals and metals.  He bought the [[Ashio copper mine]] from the Japanese government in 1877, which he later organized,  with his other holdings,  into an [[zaibatsu|industrial conglomerate]] called the [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa zaibatsu]], one of the most important in Japan.  Japanese companies today with the names "Furukawa" and "Fuji", often belong to this group.

==Biography==
Furukawa's school education began and ended before [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]]'s ships entered Japanese waters. His parents were lower middle-class and could not afford to give him a higher education. It was about the time of the treaty that opened Japan to commerce with the United States and other civilized nations, that the strong traits manifested by the boy attracted the attention of a business man in his native town. He was adopted by an eccentric man named Furukawa Tarozaemon, who gave his adopted son some schooling in business. The stepfather and son had frequent but respectful differences of opinion, but in time the father realized that Furukawa was usually right and in time gave him free rein &amp;ndash; a Japanese instance of ''[[Fortiter in re suaviter in modo|fortiter in re, suaviter in modo]]''.&lt;ref name=gateway&gt;''Gateway'' Vol.1, No.3, p.5 (Oct. 1903)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and foreign trade===
Furukawa made large profits in the raw silk trade, exporting his stock for foreign consumption. He also did well in the rice trade, while suffering severe losses at times - an early example of the vicissitudes of  commodities trading.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

===Industry===
In spite of his successes in commerce, Furukawa felt the need to be directly involved with the working man. He yearned to be a captain of industry, desirous of expanding employment opportunities for his compatriots, as unemployment was a serious problem in Japan. He had aspirations similar to a few pioneering industrialists in the West who wished to improve the lot of the working man and to expand the demand for his services. He also had benevolent ideas on raising the standard of living for the working classes, espousing methods of making provision for old age, and suitable foundations to help toward that end.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

The opportunity to fulfill his dream came about as the result of the failure of a Japanese firm, which has considerable consequence in the business of the empire. Furukawa had reflected upon the opportunities in mining. He bought out a failing copper mine and as he found [[mining]] to his liking, he bought another after a while. This second mine was old and had been worked for decades. It had always produced fairly, but was thought to be pretty well spent. Furukawa's purchase was laughed at by a few of the initiated and not even his own miners encouraged him in the venture. As operations in the mine improved under his ownership and management, it turned out to be one of the greatest mines of Japan, the now-famous [[Ashio Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

==== Copper ====
At greater depths, he found huge deposits of ore and production increased immensely. He used the great wealth he accumulated to establish his ideal industrial city in the mountains of Ashio. He built better homes for the miners, he installed schools for the young, he endowed hospitals, he built roads throughout the district, he provided instructive amusements for the working men, which was an unheard of thing in Japan at the time.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

He lived among the miners so far as the outside demands of his business would permit; when away from them he was nothing more than a plain citizen of Tokyo. All the while he was extending his operations. He bought ten more mines of coal and of copper, in different districts of Japan. All of them prospered, and with their prosperity came a better share of the better things of life for the miners, and a great extension of fields of employment.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

So huge was his wealth and influence that superstitious people began to believe that he might be a demon and that all his beneficence was simply a ploy to gain control over them. This was especially so among neighbouring communities who did not benefit directly from the wealth of the mines, in spite of the fact that the wealth of the whole region and nation benefited from it. When the enormous pollution from the mines began to affect the health of the inhabitants of the region, they felt that their suspicions were confirmed. After riots ensued, the government stepped in and demanded a remedy. In response, Furukawa built a  system of tunnels and canals to carry the industrial waste to a remote coast. The cost was great, but the work was completed under his own supervision in a short time. It was a triumph for the government and the people took it as an evidence that even the devil himself was no match for the imperial power of the Emperor.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

===Later life===
Although Furukawa might be seen as patriarchal in his ideas, and his scheme of government as monarchal, his influence remains, and he is remembered in Japan as the highest example of a far-sighted, public-spirited man, who accomplished great things, and deserved his title of the "Copper King."&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

In his seventy-second year, the year prior to his death, he went to [[Korea]] to open a gold mine. He also had in mind great plans to open mines in [[China]], cut short by his death. His great wealth and ripe old age, did not cause him to slow down. He refused to listen to the remonstrances of his friends and relatives, and remained busy, and with his usual amazing success, until the end.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

He first introduced machinery in the [[sericulture]] of Japan, thereby extending the production of silk. He preceded all others in the use of electric lights and power in his coal mines and he established the first [[coke oven]]s in Japan. He eagerly adopted all modern improvements, and was a good customer for American inventors and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

The '''General Confederation of Italian Industry''' ({{lang-it|Confederazione generale dell'industria italiana}}), commonly known as '''Confindustria''', is the [[Italy|Italian]] [[employers' federation]] and national [[chamber of commerce]], founded in 1910. It groups together more than 113,000 voluntary member companies, accounting for nearly 4,200,000 individuals. It aims to help Italy's economic growth, assisting, in doing so, its members. It is a member of the [[International Organisation of Employers]] (IOE).
The President is Vincenzo Boccia since 31 March 2016.

Confindustria was a founding member of several organizations, including ISTUD (Istituto Studi Direzionali) and Assingegneria (an organization set up by Confindustria, which has since merged with OICE, L'ingegneria italiana organizzata - which in itself belongs to Confindustria).

Born in New York, Arnold grew up in [[Lafayette, Walworth County, Wisconsin]]. Here Arnold started his career working in [[machine shop]]s. For twelve years he was journeyman machinist in western river and lake engine shops. Subsequently he was superintendent at the Ottawa Machine Shop and Foundry; department foreman at the [[E. W.

''The emergence of systematic management as shown by the literature of management from 1870-1900.'' p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; In those days Arnold had also started inventing new tools.

He continued to research and invented a range of products from "metal cutters to recorders, book binding, book stitching and book covering machines, mixers, letter locks..., piston water meters and water motors, knitting machines, 'explosive' and internal combustion engines and combustion generators, and clutches."&lt;ref name="RM 2011"/&gt;

Late 1880s Arnold started his own [[typewriter]] company.&lt;ref name="RM 2011"/&gt; In the 1890s he started as a technical journalist for journals such as the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'', the ''Automobile Trade Journal,'' and the ''[[American Machinist]].''. He wrote his articles using different pen names of which Henry Roland and Hugh Dolnar were the best known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hounshell, David A.]] (1984), ''From the American System to Mass Production, 1800-1932: The Development of Manufacturing Technology in the United States''. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YAS 2002"&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav|Yehouda A. Shenhav]] (2002). ''Manufacturing Rationality: The Engineering Foundations of the Managerial Revolution''. Oxford University Press. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold also wrote at least three books published by the Engineering Magazine Press in New York.

Arnold died of pneumonia in [[Detroit]] on January 25, 1915 at the age of 77.&lt;ref name="IM 1914-15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Automobile Topics'' Vol. 36 (1914-15). p. 1106&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Business Week'' (1966) recalled, that "every reader of the ''Engineering Magazine'' knew what the connection was: Arnold had died on the job of tracking down the full Ford story."&lt;ref&gt;''Business Week''. Part 3. (1966). p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Engineering Magazine'', 1895-1914 ===
In the 1890s Arnold started writing on technology and management subjects in ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'', and would continue to contribute until his death. In 1898 H.M. Norris reviewed&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Norris "A simple and effective system of shop cost-keeping". ''Engineering Magazine'' Vol 16. (1898). p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Mr. Henry Roland's [Horace L. Arnold's] many valuable contributions on this subject to ''The Engineering Magazine'' afford a rare opportunity for the study of the practice followed by many leading firms, and contain much of interest to every one connected with shop management. His incisive drawing of the difficulties to be met and overcome in the re-organization of an old and well-established business will strike home to the hearts of many managers. If proprietors could be brought to a better understanding of what a strong organization would mean to them, the work of the manager would be much simplified.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For this work Arnold is nowadays considered among the foremost writers on management techniques, such as wage systems, [[production control]] and inventory control. He was among the foremost writers of the late 19th century, such as [[Henry R. Towne]], [[Captain Henry Metcalfe|Henry Metcalfe]], [[John Tregoning]] and [[Slater Lewis]]; and among early 20th-century authors as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|C.E. Knoeppel]], [[Harrington Emerson]], [[Clinton Edgar Woods]], [[Charles U. Carpenter]], [[Alexander Hamilton Church]] and [[Henry Gantt]].&lt;ref name="YAS 2002"/&gt;

=== ''Modern Machine-Shop Economics,'' 1896 ===
In 1896 Arnold wrote a first series of articles for the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' about [[machine shop]]s, entitled "Modern Machine-Shop Economics."&lt;ref name="HLA 1896"/&gt; This work stretched out from production technology, production methods and factory lay-out to time studies, production planning, and machine shop management. Some of the companies still exist.

In the next years a few more series of articles on these topic would follow in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' .

=== ''Six examples of successful shop management,'' 1897 ===
In 1897 Arnold published a second series, entitled "Six examples of successful shop management."&lt;ref name="HLA 1897"/&gt; [[Francis G. Burton|Burton]] (1899) summarized, that these papers "giving six examples of successful shop management, wherein the influence of fair and just dealing, of isolation and environment, and of careful detailed supervision and definite contracts, upon the prosperity of the factories and the contentment of the work people are cleverly traced. The success is, however, in most cases, that of isolated works under the dominance of exceptionally skilful managers, who impress their own rectitude and personality on the establishment, rather than of any system which recommends itself for general adoption."&lt;ref name="FGB 1899"&gt;* [[Francis G. Burton]]. ''[https://archive.org/stream/commercialmanag00burtgoog#page/n189/mode/2up The Commercial Management of Engineering Works].'' (1899). p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first article recounted about the Whitin Machine Shop in Whitinsville in [[Northbridge, Massachusetts]] (see images), at its peak the largest manufacturer of textile machines in the world.&lt;ref name="whitin"&gt;{{cite book|last= Navin|first = Thomas R|authorlink= |title =The Whitin Machine Works since 1831: A textile machinery company in an industrial village; Harvard studies in business history| publisher=Russel and Russel|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the second article was about the [[Yale (company)|Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing Co]] (see images), where [[Henry R. Towne]] was president at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (1897, p. 395)&lt;/ref&gt; In those days the company faced serious labour problems, and Towne introduced a series of "measures. He ended the contract system, introduced piece rates, which he guaranteed for one year, and established systematic procedures for dealing with grievances. On new work Towne set minimum and maximum earnings levels so that piece rates, if incorrect, would not unduly punish or reward workers.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (1897, p. 404-6)&lt;/ref&gt;..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nelson (1996). ''Managers and Workers: Origins of the Twentieth-Century Factory System in the United States, 1880–1920.'' 1996, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth article, entitled "Pre-Eminent Success of the Differential Piece Rate System", Arnold described the [[Taylor System]]  as worked out by the [[Midvale Steel Company]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Bertrand Thompson. "The Literature of Scientific Management," ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics,'' Vol. 28, No. 3 (May, 1914), pp. 506-557. Published by: Oxford University Press Article [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884986 Stable URL].&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the operation of the [[piece-rate system]] at Midvale Steel was described, and the analytic method of rate-fixing deveped by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (1897, p. 834)&lt;/ref&gt; In those days the rates in the piecework system were set by the supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (1897, p. 96-98)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nelson (1996, 45-46.).&lt;/ref&gt; Burton commented, that this paper contained contains some pregnant remarks on the increase of output through the stimulus of unfettered piecework rates, and is deserving of the most grave consideration by English managers and workmen... The justice and economy of piece-work, even under fixed and absolute rates, is admirably expressed."&lt;ref name="FGB 1899"/&gt; As Arnold stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only does the fast man do more work, but that work is done at a reduced fixed-charges cost, and the intelligent manager discovers that he must greatly increase the pay of the speedy man or decrease the pay of the slow man to make each equally profitable. Under these conditions the piece-rate at once suggests itself as a remedy. The piece-rate stimulates the slow artisan, and justly rewards the quick worker, tends to increase the area output, and lessen the fixed-charges drawback on profits.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (1897, p. 831)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the whole series Kaufman (2008) commented, that "a distinctive feature of the six examples of successful shop management highlighted by [Arnold] is that they practiced a relatively benevolent and light-handed form of [[autocracy]] in which the golden rule of fair dealing and 'doing unto others' was a guiding management principle. This form of enlightened autocracy was frequently labeled '[[industrial paternalism]]' with the idea that the company was a family, the employer played the role of the benevolent but exacting father (the paternal figure), and the employees were akin to teenage children who, with suitable guidance and discipline, would work together to produce what the family required (as on a family farm)."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Kaufman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dAr3GmiKG5MC&amp;pg=PA11 Managing the Human Factor: The Early Years of Human Resource Management in American Industry].'' 2008. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Effective systems of finding and keeping shop costs'', 1898 ===
In 1897-98 Arnold published a first series about cost keeping in [[machine shop]]s, entitled "Cost-Keeping Methods in Machine-Shop and Foundry,"&lt;ref name="HLA 1897-98"/&gt; and in 1898 he published a second series of six articles, entitled "Effective systems of finding and keeping shop costs."&lt;ref name="HLA 1898"/&gt;

This work contributed to the wider discussion among British and American engineers about the development of a costing system for factories. Initial contributions were made by [[Captain Henry Metcalfe|Metcalfe]] (1885/86), [[Emile Garcke|Garcke]] (1887), [[Henry R. Towne|Towne]] (1889), [[F.A. Halsey|Halsey]] (1891),etc., and further contributions came from [[Sterling Bunnell|Bunnell]], [[Alexander Hamilton Church|Church]], [[Hugo Diemer|Diemer]], [[Henry Laurence Gantt|Gantt]], [[Lingan S. Randolph|Randolph]], [[Oberlin Smith]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor]], among others.&lt;ref name="MCW 1996"&gt;Murray C. Wells (1996) "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/353 Engineering and accounting]" in: ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia.'' [[Michael Chatfield]], [[Richard Vangermeersch]] eds. 1996/2014. p. 269-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

These discussion focussed on topics such as "costing methods, estimating, overhead allocations, economies of scale and other topics normally associated with the [[accounting]]."&lt;ref name="MCW 1996"/&gt; Wells (1996) stated, that these early pioneers in the field of [[cost accounting]], became aware of the "arbitrary nature of cost allocations... [proceeding] accountants by 50 years or more."&lt;ref name="MCW 1996"/&gt; In that respect, Arnold considered these costs 'probable', yet considered the information from the system 'absolute correct.' Randolph and Diemer (1903) would speak of 'accurate costs' and 'correct' or 'accurate' information. Wells added that these "engineers (as did the accountants who followed them) failed to recognize the difference between a system that allocated all of the overhead costs "accurately"—there were no residual costs unallocated—and the arbitrary cost of production that resulted from the use of some broad allocation base such as direct 
wages."&lt;ref name="MCW 1996"/&gt;

=== Written records in business ===
Arnold was known as promoter of written records in business. Arnold (1901) was convinced, that "Even if entire honesty and sincerity prevailed at all times in all business transactions, the mere differences due to variations in individual understandings of orders would render it impossible to conduct any business of magnitude on verbal specifications."&lt;ref name="JAY 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As cited in [[Joseph August Litterer]] ''The emergence of systematic management as shown by the literature of management from 1870-1900''. Garland, 1 aug. 1986. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ford Methods and the Ford Shops'', 1915 ===
[[File:Ford methods and the Ford shops, 1915.jpg|thumb|480px|''Ford Methods and the Ford Shops'', title plate and title page, 1915]]
Under the penname Hugh Dolnar, Arnold also wrote for the leading automotive magazine ''Automobile Trade Journal'', where he was one of the most respected reporters.&lt;ref&gt;Francois Therou (1971) ''Buick: "the golden era", 1903-1915''. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Ford]] admired his work&lt;ref name="JMR 2001"&gt;[[James M. Rubenstein]] (2001) ''Making and Selling Cars: Innovation and Change in the U.S.''. p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and early 1910s invited him to study his factory and write about the new production techniques at the [[Highland Park Ford Plant]]. This resulted in the book ''Ford Methods and the Ford Shops'', which he left unfinished after his death in 1915.

The engineer Fay Leone Faurote (1881-1938) finished his work, which was published in 1915 by the Engineering Magazine company, and became Arnold's best known work. This book introduced the moving assembly line to the larger audience,&lt;ref name="JMR 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Dupont Chandler]] (1977) ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business.'' p. 561. Chandler added that "the story of the introduction of the moving assembly line is dramatically told in [[Allan Nevins]] and Frank E. Hill, ''Ford: The Times, The Men and The Company'' (New York, 1954), chap. 18."&lt;/ref&gt; explained about its slow progress,&lt;ref&gt;W. Licht (2001) ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Production''&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that this system could be applied in any small machine factory.&lt;ref&gt;Hounsell (1984: p. 375)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
A short obituary in the ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal'' (1915) wrote:
:''Those readers who have been with us for five or more years are familiar with "Hugh Dolnar" which was the pen name adopted by Horace L. Arnold. For years "Hugh Dolnar" wrote car descriptions and special automobile engineering articles for the Automobile Trade Journal. His work was by far the most thorough and valuable published during the formative period of the greater automobile industry, and had a style and snap to it which has never been equaled by any other technical writer on automobile construction."&lt;ref name="CATJ 1915"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090781869;view=1up;seq=836 Horace L. Arnold (Hugh Dolnar), died]," in: ''Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal,'' Volume 19. Chilton Company, 1915. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
His last work for the ''Automobile Trade Journal'' had been on the Ford Factory, the 50-page longe article "The Ford Achievement",.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Dolnar (1913; 115-165)&lt;/ref&gt; published in April, 1914.&lt;ref name="CATJ 1915"/&gt;

'''Jaime Gilinski Bacal''' (born 14 December 1957) is a Colombian banker and [[real estate developer]]. Gilinski resides in London. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', he is the second richest person in Colombia, with a net worth of US$3.9 billion as of May 2018.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt;

== Early life ==
He is the son of [[Isaac Gilinski Sragowicz]], a banker and himself the son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.

Gilinski earned his BS in [[Industrial Engineering]] from [[Georgia Tech]] in 1978, and an MBA from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt;

== Banking ==
In the 1990s, Gilinski acquired the Colombian assets of BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) for a nominal sum after its global collapse. Renamed Banco Andino, it became one of the most efficient banks in the Colombian banking system within four years. The Gilinski Group sold the reconstituted bank for a reported $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-nacion/regreso-gilinski/81674.aspx|title=El regreso de los Gilinski|accessdate=2009-07-13|publisher=Semana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family then moved to purchase Banco de Colombia for $365 million, in what was then the largest privatization in Colombia's history. A group of premier private equity investors led by Morgan Stanley Asset Management investing $65 million, billionaire [[George Soros]] investing $50 million and Tiger Asset Management with $35 million together with more than 100 other European and North American institutional investors co-invested with Gilinski.  Later, the family sold control of the bank to Banco Industrial Colombiano, and its controlling stakeholder Sindicato Antioqueño, in a deal valued at $800 million, among Colombia's largest deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/26/business/big-bank-in-colombia-is-purchasing-a-rival.html|title=Big Bank in Colombia Is Purchasing a Rival| accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=New York Times | date=1997-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilinski received $418 million for its stake and retained a minority position in the new bank as part of the deal. As of 2018, Bancolombia was the largest in Colombia with a market capitalization of $11 billion on the [[NYSE]].&lt;ref name="Banking in Colombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankcali.com/?p=21|title=Banking in Colombia|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Gilinski acquired and subsequently merged Banco Sudameris and Banco Tequendema. This merger created GNB Sudameris, a bank with assets of over US $10 billion that ranks among the largest private Colombian banks as of 2018. The purchase of Servibanca, an ATM network with over 2,600 machines, and Suma Valores, a stock exchange commission agent company, has further expanded the network.&lt;ref name="Banking in Colombia"/&gt;

In May 2012, HSBC announced the sale of its Latin American operations (Colombia, Peru, Paraguay) to Banco GNB Sudameris for $400 million in cash. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In September 2013, Banco Sabadell announced that Gilinski became its largest shareholder as the anchor investor in a US $1.8 billion capital raise. Through the ABB and share rights issue, Gilinski's investment totals approximately $500 million. Banco Sabadell is the 5th largest bank in Spain, with over US $220 billion in assets and a 13% market share.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Gilinski group also owns Yupi, a snack food company in Latin America, and exports to nine countries. Gilinski Group also owns Rimax Plastics, which was founded by his father Isaac Gilinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-portada/sueno-crecer/111307.aspx|title=El Sueno de crecer|accessdate=2009-06-24|publisher=Semana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real estate ==
In partnership with [[London &amp; Regional Properties]], Gilinski is developing the [[Panama Pacifico]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panama-pacifico.com/SecondaryTemplate.aspx?task=view&amp;option=content&amp;id=300|title=Construction commences in Howard|accessdate=2009-06-02|publisher=Canal 13 - Telemetro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; business and residential development in [[Panama City]], Panama. Jaime Gilinski and his partners [[Ian and Richard Livingstone]] beat 16 other international firms in a competition to develop the project. The $10 billion project, based on the former Howard Air Force Base in Panama, includes {{convert|2750|acre|km2}} of land, which makes it one of the largest development projects in the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Philanthropy ==
In the 1990s, the Gilinskis contributed US$8 million to the Fundacion Santa Fe. This was during Jaime Gilinski's time as chairman of Banco de Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsfb.org.co/node/226|title=Benefactores|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226142710/http://www.fsfb.org.co/node/226|archivedate=2014-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá supports Santa Fe Hospital in Bogotá. Founded in 1972, this hospital is recognized as Colombia’s most technologically advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsfb.org.co/fsfb?q=node/294|title=Conozca la Historia de la Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá|accessdate=2013-03-09|publisher=Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226134624/http://www.fsfb.org.co/fsfb?q=node%2F294|archivedate=2014-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilinski is the chair of Capital Projects for The Chabad House at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/4/7/harvard-chabad-dedicates-new-home-harvard/|title = Harvard Chabad Dedicates New Home|accessdate = 2016-02-08|publisher = The Harvard Crimson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chabad House at Harvard is a Jewish [[student organization]] that provides educational, social, and recreational programming for students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chabadharvard.org/about/vision-and-impact|title = Vision &amp; Values|accessdate = 2016-02-08|publisher = The Chabad House at Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Jaime and Raquel Gilinski Endowment, Gilinski supports the [[David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~icop/otherlatinosprogram.html|title=Other Latinos Program|accessdate=2009-06-02|publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is married to Raquel Gilinski. They have four children and live in London, England.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt; He has further houses in New York, Panama, Miami and Colombia.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt;

Jaime and Raquel Gilinski have also established the Jaime and Raquel Gilinski Fellowship at [[Harvard Business School]], awarded to MBA students from Colombia and Panama, with a secondary preference for students from other Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.hbs.edu/giving/fellowship_list.html|title=Recent Fellowships List|accessdate=2010-06-11|publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyulgerov is also the owner of one of the largest travel fare aggregators in the Russian segment of the Internet.&lt;ref name="биодюльгеров"&gt; [https://dyulgerov.info/ru/biografiya-ru Autobiography of Dyulgerov K.I. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public activity  ===

Since 2008, Dyulgerov actively participates in opposition activities and anti-corruption movement. In 2008, Dyulgerov gave his first series of public speeches, in which he exposed and sharply criticized the acting authorities and law enforcement structures of the region. He voiced the accusations of conspiracy, extortion, and corruption, claiming that he refused the offers of "paid protection" suggested by the local law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;Article by mbk.media [https://mbk.media/suzhet/titov-nazval-imena-2/ «Чем известны бизнесмены из „списка Титова“»]&lt;/ref&gt; The exposing facts voiced by Dulgerov provoked public resonance in the region.

Later, Dyulgerov actively participated in the various protest movement activities, including the biggest – the March of Millions, a rally on Academician Sakharov Avenue and others. Dyulgerov was providing financial assistance to Russian non-systemic opposition.&lt;ref name="рупостерс000"&gt; [https://ruposters.ru/news/07-02-2018/biznesmen-zahotel-vernutsya-rossiyu article by Ruposters.ru (In Russian): «Финансировавший протесты на Болотной бизнесмен захотел вернуться в Россию»]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Dyulgerov has regularly criticized the authorities on the widely-discussed issues,&lt;ref&gt;K. Dyulgerov's interview to the [http://niros.ru/obschestvo/96161-konstantin-dyulgerov-rossiya-eto-policeysko-banditskoe-gosudarstvo.html «Национальные интересы»]&lt;/ref&gt; including the non-admission of Russian athletes to the Olympics,&lt;ref name="рупостерс000"&gt; [https://ruposters.ru/news/07-02-2018/biznesmen-zahotel-vernutsya-rossiyu article by Ruposters.ru (In Russian): «Финансировавший протесты на Болотной бизнесмен захотел вернуться в Россию»]&lt;/ref&gt; the failure of import substitution policy and food security, the political and economic structure of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin Dyulgerov's [https://dyulgerov.info/en/ personal blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal prosecution ===

In 2008, law enforcement authorities launched criminal proceedings against Dyulgerov on suspicion of fraud.   In 2010 the case was terminated, however, in 2011 the investigation was resumed. According to the investigation, Konstantin Dyulgerov illegally appropriated the share of Sergey Kiryanov, the second founder of OOO Samotlor Trading Company. After lengthy arbitration proceedings, Kiryanov's 49% share was returned to him. However, the criminal case against Dyulgerov was never terminated.&lt;ref&gt;article by RBK. 7 February 2018. (In Russian):[http://www.interfax.ru/russia/598885 " «Список Титова»: кто из беглых бизнесменов захотел вернуться в Россию ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that Sergei Kiryanov is the son-in-law of Nikolai Brykin, ex-general of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and tax police, who is now a deputy of the State Duma from the "United Russia" party.&lt;ref&gt;Official profile of deputy Brykin N.G.[http://www.gosduma.net/structure/deputies/1756768/ on the official website of State Duma of Russian Federation. (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, as a result, after receiving charges of fraud, Dyulgerov moved to the United States, as he claimed, to escape the political and criminal persecution. According to Dyulgerov, the said disputed share of Sergei Kiryanov was actually a payment for the enforced "protection". When he refused to pay, they accused him of trying to steal Kiryanov's share. In 2014, another criminal case was launched against him. He is accused of allegedly bribing the witness and compelling him to testify (Article 390 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). Following this, Dyulgerov was put on the international wanted list. Dyulgerov denies all charges, declaring his innocence.&lt;ref name="биодюльгеров"&gt; [https://dyulgerov.info/ru/biografiya-ru Autobiography of Dyulgerov K.I. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Dyulgerov was included in the "Titov's list" which contains, at the time of publication, the names of 16 businessmen who are being persecuted by Russian law enforcement. According to Boris Titov, the entrepreneurs included in the list were persecuted for dubious reasons, criminal cases against them must be carefully examined and reviewed. The list was submitted to the Administration of the President of Russia, with the official confirmation of its reception and acceptance for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Information  [http://www.interfax.ru/russia/598885 published by Interfax.

==Overview==
{{quote|text=We’re now entering the third industrial revolution, Anderson said. The first one, which began with the [[spinning jenny]] in 1776, doubled the human life span and set population soaring. From the demographic perspective, "it’s as if nothing happened before the Industrial Revolution."

The next revolution was digital. Formerly industrial processes like printing were democratized with [[desktop publishing]]. The "cognitive surplus" of formerly passive consumers was released into an endless variety of personal creativity. Then distribution was democratized by the Web, which is "scale agnostic and credentials agnostic." Anyone can potentially reach 7 billion people.

The third revolution is digital manufacturing, which combines the gains of the first two revolutions. Factory robots, which anyone can hire, have become general purpose and extremely fast. They allow "lights-out manufacturing," that goes all night and all weekend.

"This will reverse the arrow of globalization," Anderson said. "The centuries of quest for cheaper labor is over. Labor arbitrage no longer drives trade." The advantages of speed and flexibility give the advantage to "locavore" manufacturing because "Closer is faster." Innovation is released from the dead weight of large-batch commitments. Designers now can sit next to the robots building their designs and make adjustments in real time.

'''Dr. Moritz''' ''(Don Mauricio)'' '''Hochschild''' (1881 in [[Biblis]], [[Germany]] &amp;ndash; 1965 in [[Paris]], France) was one of the most famous men in the mining industry in the first half of the twentieth century and was, along with [[Simón Iturri Patiño]] and [[Carlos Víctor Aramayo]], one of the three so-called [[Bolivia]]n [[tin]] barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Secret Schindler: Mauricio Hochschild | website=aishcom | date=2017-05-20 | url=http://www.aish.com/ho/p/The-Secret-Schindler-Mauricio-Hochschild.html | access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that he saved Jews during the [[Holocaust]] as well.

==Early life==
Hochschild was an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] [[Jew]] whose family had already been active in the mining industry for over a generation. He was the eldest son of a general trader who had two cousins involved in the metal industry: brothers [[Berthold Hochschild]], who founded the [[American Metal Company]] and [[Zachary Hochschild]], a partner in [[Metallgesellschaft]].&lt;ref name=WaszkisReview&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title= A Review of Helmut Waszkis' "Dr. Moritz (Don Mauricio) Hochschild 1881-1965.

A German ]ewish Mining Entrepreneur in South America|publisher=|date= |url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v10-2003-Hillman_rev_Waszkis.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hochschild graduated from school, he studied mining and engineering at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology]].&lt;ref name=papers&gt;[http://findingaids.cjh.org/index2.php?fnm=MoritzHochschild&amp;pnm=LBI Papers of Moritz Hochschild]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905, he began his career in the field at the large industrial conglomerate [[Metallgesellschaft]].&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; and then as the company's agent in [[Spain]] and [[Australia]] and then finally moved to South America to work independently.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;  After several years in [[Chile]], he returned to Germany and stayed there until the end of the [[World War I|first World War]].

==Career==
In 1918, he married Käthe Rosenbaum and in 1920, he returned once again to Bolivia.  In 1920, his son, Gerardo Hochschild Rosenbaum, was born; his wife died in 1924.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; During the following two decades, Hochschild built up an economic empire in [[Bolivia]] around the mining and trade of tin ore.  His empire stretched from [[Peru]] in the north to [[Chile]] in the south.  During this period of growth, more of his family followed him to South America to work for him, including his cousin Philipp Hochschild and Philipp's wife Germaine.  Moritz (or Don Mauricio, as he was known in South America) and Germaine had an affair, and they married after Germaine divorced Philipp.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

The 1930s saw the peak of the Moritz Hochschild Group's economical and political influence. In 1938, using his influence with [[German Busch]], Bolivia's military president from 1937 to 1939, Hochschild pushed Bolivia to open its doors to Jewish refugees from Hitler's Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Bolivian Schindler' saved 9,000 Jews from Nazi Germany | website=Daily Mail Online | date=2017-03-18 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4326068/Bolivian-Schindler-saved-9-000-Jews-Nazi-Germany.html | access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 9,000 were admitted. Hochschild also funded the transport of the refugees and their housing once they arrived in the South American country. Newspapers have called him "Bolivia's Schindler."

In both 1939 and 1944, Hochschild was arrested by the Bolivian government and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; Just two weeks after his release following his 1944 arrest, he was captured and held by kidnappers for two weeks. After he was freed he left Bolivia, never to return.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

In 1951, the Hochschilds donated the majority of their fortune to the ''Hochschild Trust and Foundation''.  In the following year, the Moritz Hochschild Group was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] during the [[History of Bolivia#Bolivian National Revolution|Bolivian National Revolution]]; however, they were compensated with an allotment of 30% of the company's prior assets.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; The company, [[Hochschild Mining]], grew further and expanded worldwide.  In 1961 Hochschild inaugurated Mantos Blancos copper mine in [[Antofagasta]], [[Chile]], which became his most successful mining operation, although its best results were to come after his death.

'''PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc''' is a publicly listed Nigerian manufacturer and distributor of consumer products such as detergents, toiletries, soaps and home appliances. It is a subsidiary of Manchester based [[PZ Cussons|PZ Cussons Holdings]] that owns controlling shares in the firm.

PZ trades home appliances products under the brand [[Haier]] Thermocool and manages Coolworld electrical stores.&lt;ref name="ar"/&gt; It has a joint venture with [[Wilmar International|Wilmar International]] to produce and trade vegetable oil and palm oil.

==History==
The company's operations can be traced to the [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Sierra Leone]] based commodities and textile dealing partnership of George Paterson and [[George Zochonis]]. The partners who were of Scottish and Greek heritage established a West African trading post in Sierra Leone in 1879 which was later incorporated in Great Britain as Patterson Zochonis in February 1884.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trading Post Company Which Grew and Grew." Manchester: Financial Times Survey. Financial Times, 20 Jan. 1984, p. 19. The Financial Times Historical Archive&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the partners opened a trading post in Nigeria and soon developed a merchandising network within the country. In the 1950s, the firm began producing soaps in Nigeria from a factory in [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]],&lt;ref name="cheesebright"/&gt; incorporating it under a subsidiary called Alagbon Industries. In 1957, the group transferred assets not affiliated with its soap business to a newly incorporated company in Nigeria called Patterson Zochonis Nigeria Limited. Alagbon industries was later known as Associated Industries and then changed to Paterson Zochonis Industries Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thenationonlineng.net/pz-nigeria-plc-continuing-its-winning-streak/ |title=PZ Nigeria Plc: Continuing its winning streak - The Nation Nigeria |date=2014-10-08 |work=The Nation Nigeria |access-date=2018-07-29 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became publicly listed on the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]] in 1972, selling 40% of its shares to the Nigerian public, a further 60% was sold in 1977.

The firm reduced its trading activities during the 1970s.

In 2003, the firm launched a joint venture with [[Glanbia|Glanbia group]] to produce evaporated milk and milk powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.just-food.com/news/glanbia-quits-pz-cussons-nigeria-venture_id129638.aspx |title=Glanbia quits PZ Cussons Nigeria venture |date=2015-04-01 |access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parcel audit''' (also referred to as '''small package auditing''' or '''small parcel auditing''') is the process of reviewing shipping invoices for invalid charges and other billing inaccuracies. Each shipment tendered to a major parcel carrier like UPS and FedEx come with service guarantees outlined within each carrier's tariff or service guide. An increasing number of businesses contract third-party companies to perform these services because they have the technology necessary to automate the otherwise time consuming process.

==Parcel invoices==
Parcel carriers like [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx]], and [[DHL Express|DHL]] often have large, long, and complicated invoices. A customer shipping a high volume of parcel boxes via one of these carriers sees invoices hundreds of pages long. The invoices show a high amount of visibility to how a package was carried and delivered. This finite data is collected by UPS and FedEx for tracking purposes and to automate the process of charging the appropriate amount to their clients.

==Invoicing process: errors and overbills==
The invoicing process is so automated that mistakes happen often. Insiders to UPS and FedEx claim that little focus is spent to prevent billing for inappropriate charges: duplicate charges, incorrect [[discounts and allowances|discount]] amounts, and phantom accessorial charges. Invoicing errors are a common phenomenon, and most large carriers provide teams and electronic forms to contest improper charges on invoices. With the proper data to dispute the charges, they are often credited in a matter of hours.&lt;ref&gt;Parcel audit invoice mistakes, https://www.controlpay.com/blog/small-parcel-audit-invoice-mistakes-you-can-expect-shipper&lt;/ref&gt;

Overbilling - or service failures - is a larger problem than invoicing errors. A service failure occurs when a package with a time-sensitive guarantee is delivered late and a refund is due to the client. Most carriers like UPS and FedEx place the responsibility on the customer to check the timeliness of the delivered package. Once the service failure is found, the carrier typically credits the amount due quickly. The terms and conditions for claiming a late package are stated and the act of claiming a refund is also time-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.controlpay.com/blog/5-effective-ways-reduce-parcel-shipping-costs 5 effective ways to reduce parcel shipping costs - ControlPay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published savings rates==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Up to 5% of a clients UPS and/or FedEx charges are due to errors or overbilled items. This results in around $2&amp;nbsp;billion of unclaimed refunds.

==How to implement audit==
Customers forward their electronic billing file or approve their carriers to send the electronic billing files directly to the auditor. Most auditors accept all forms of electronic billing files. Customers may request these files from their carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Cost Recovery, "Parcel Audit [http://tcrecovery.com/small-parcel-management/]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition in the parcel audit industry==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The parcel auditing industry, otherwise knows as small package audit, has been growing in popularity. Most auditors operate using a performance-based model.

#Early or concurrential/ [[monopoly]]/ [[state monopoly capitalism]] ([[Paul Sweezy|Sweezy]] etc.)
#Free trade/ monopoly/ [[finance capitalism]] ([[Rudolf Hilferding|Hilferding]] etc.)
#Early capitalism ([[primitive accumulation]])/ [[colonialism]]/ [[imperialism]] ([[John A. Hobson|Hobson]], Lenin, Bukharin) 
#[[Extensive stage]]/ [[intensive stage]]/ ([[late capitalism]]) ([[Michel Aglietta|Aglietta]])

The [[Marxist]] periodization of capitalism into the stages:&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, Donald. Routledge Dictionary of Economics. pages 70&lt;/ref&gt; agricultural capitalism, [[merchant capitalism]], industrial capitalism and [[state capitalism]].

Another periodization includes [[merchant capitalism]], industrial and [[finance capitalism]], and [[global capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John H. global capitalism at bay? pages 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John H. Making Globalization Good. pages 181&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perth''' is a [[List of Perth suburbs|suburb]] in [[Western Australia]] that includes both the [[Perth CBD|central business district]] of the [[Perth|Perth metropolitan area]],&lt;ref name="lg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/docvault.nsf/web/PS_FREEMAP/$FILE/Perth_Inner_Metro_Mosaic.pdf|title=Free Maps – Perth Inner – Metropolitan|year=2008|publisher=[[Landgate]]|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a suburban area spreading north to the northern side of [[Hyde Park, Western Australia|Hyde Park]]. It does not include the separate suburbs of [[Northbridge, Western Australia|Northbridge]] or [[Highgate, Western Australia|Highgate]].

Perth is split between the [[City of Perth]] and the [[City of Vincent]] local authorities. Perth was named after the [[Perth, Scotland|city of the same name]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name="lg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www0.landgate.wa.gov.au/maps-and-imagery/wa-geographic-names/name-history/historical-suburb-names#P|title=History of Metropolitan Suburb Names|publisher=[[Landgate]]|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Built environment ==
The dominant land use in Perth is commercial. Office buildings include [[108 St Georges Terrace]], [[QV.1]], [[Brookfield Place (Perth)|Brookfield Place]] and [[Central Park, Perth|Central Park]] – the tallest building in the city and the [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|eighth tallest in Australia]].&lt;ref name="cp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.central-park.com.au/Public/home.asp|title=Home|publisher=Central Park|accessdate=29 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503175038/http://www.central-park.com.au/Public/home.asp|archivedate=3 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Significant buildings ===
[[File:Perth Council House.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Council House, Perth]]]]

The [[Perth Town Hall]], built between 1868 and 1870, was designed as an administrative centre for the newly formed [[City of Perth]]. By the late 1950s the Town Hall was considered too small for the council's requirements so [[Council House, Perth|Council House]], a [[Modern architecture|modernist]] steel and glass building, was commissioned. Completed in 1960, Council House has divided opinions over its architectural merit.&lt;ref name="hc3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/C%20-%20A-D/02097%20Council%20House%20(I-AD).PDF|title=Register of Heritage Places – Assessment Documentation – Council House|publisher=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Town Hall and Council House are on the [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref name="hcwa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/comprehensivereport.html?place_seq=2097|title=Places Database – Council House, Perth|publisher=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hcwa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/comprehensivereport.html?place_seq=1953|title=Places Database – Perth Town Hall|publisher=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]]|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==

'''Project management''' is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the [[Work (project management)|work]] of a [[Project team|team]] to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. A [[project]] is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.&lt;ref&gt;*''The Definitive Guide to Project Management''. Nokes, Sebastian. 2nd Ed.n. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-273-71097-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.org/About-Us/About-Us-What-is-Project-Management.aspx |title=What is Project Management? |publisher=[[Project Management Institute]] |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with [[business operations|business as usual (or operations)]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Dinsmore et al (2005) ''The right projects done right!'' John Wiley and Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7879-7113-8}}. p.35 and further.&lt;/ref&gt; which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services. In practice, the [[management]] of such distinct production approaches requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.&lt;ref name="Cattani201u1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cattani, G. |author2=Ferriani, S. |author3=Frederiksen, L. |author4=Florian, T. |year=2011 |title=Project-Based Organizing and Strategic Management |series=Advances in Strategic Management |volume=28 |publisher=Emerald |isbn=1780521936 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?issn=0742-3322&amp;volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Phillips (2003). ''PMP Project Management Professional Study Guide''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003. {{ISBN|0-07-223062-2}} p.354.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is usually described in project documentation, created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are [[Scope (project management)|scope]], time, [[quality (business)|quality]] and [[budget]].&lt;ref name="PMI 10"/&gt; The secondary — and more ambitious — challenge is to [[operations research|optimize]] the [[Resource allocation|allocation]] of necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives. The object of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. In many cases the object of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief in order to feasibly be able to address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should influence all decisions made by other people involved in the project - for example project managers, designers, contractors and sub-contractors. Ill-defined or too tightly prescribed project management objectives are detrimental to decision making.

==History==
Until 1900, [[civil engineering]] projects were generally managed by creative architects, engineers, and [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]]s themselves, for example, [[Vitruvius]] (first century BC), [[Christopher Wren]] (1632–1723), [[Thomas Telford]] (1757–1834) and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806–1859).&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Lock (2007) ''Project Management'' (9th ed.) Gower Publishing, Ltd., 2007. {{ISBN|0-566-08772-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s organizations started to systematically apply project-management tools and techniques to complex engineering projects.&lt;ref name="YHK05"&gt;Young-Hoon Kwak (2005). "A brief History of Project Management". In: ''The story of managing projects''. Elias G. Carayannis et al. (9 eds), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. {{ISBN|1-56720-506-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Henry Gantt.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), the father of planning and control techniques]]

As a discipline, project management developed from several fields of application including civil construction, engineering, and heavy [[Defense (military)|defense]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[David I. Cleland]], [[Roland Gareis]] (2006). ''Global Project Management Handbook''. "Chapter 1: "The evolution of project management". McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006. {{ISBN|0-07-146045-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two forefathers of project management are [[Henry Gantt]], called the father of planning and control techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Stevens (2002). ''Project Management Pathways''. Association for Project Management. APM Publishing Limited, 2002
{{ISBN|1-903494-01-X}} p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt; who is famous for his use of the [[Gantt chart]] as a project management tool (alternatively ''Harmonogram'' first proposed by [[Karol Adamiecki]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Marsh (1975). "The Harmonogram of Karol Adamiecki". In: ''The Academy of Management Journal''. Vol. 18, No. 2 (Jun., 1975), p. 358. ([https://www.jstor.org/pss/255537 online])&lt;/ref&gt;); and [[Henri Fayol]] for his creation of the five management functions that form the foundation of the body of knowledge associated with project and program management.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morgen Witzel]] (2003). ''Fifty key figures in management''. Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-36977-0}}. p. 96-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Gantt and Fayol were students of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s theories of [[scientific management]]. His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and [[resource allocation]].

The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era where core engineering fields come together to work as one. Project management became recognized as a distinct discipline arising from the management discipline with engineering model.&lt;ref name="ClGa06"&gt;[[David I. Cleland]], Roland Gareis (2006). ''Global Project Management Handbook''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006. {{ISBN|0-07-146045-4}}. p.1-4 states: "''It was in the 1950s when project management was formally recognized as a distinct contribution arising from the management discipline.''"&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad-hoc basis, using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical [[Schedule (project management)|project-scheduling]] models were developed. The "[[Critical Path Method|critical path method]]" (CPM) was developed as a joint venture between [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. The "[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|program evaluation and review technique]]" (PERT), was developed by the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] as part of the [[Polaris missile]] submarine program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald G. Malcolm|Malcolm, D. G.]], Roseboom, J. H., Clark, C. E., &amp; [[Willard Fazar|Fazar, W.]] (1959). "[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF/PM-History_PERT-Original_Paper.pdf Application of a technique for research and development program evaluation]." ''Operations research,'' 7(5), 646-669.
&lt;/ref&gt;

PERT and CPM are very similar in their approach but still present some differences. CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.
[[File:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|240px|[[PERT|PERT network chart]] for a seven-month project with five milestones]]

At the same time, as project-scheduling models were being developed, technology for project cost [[Estimation (project management)|estimating]], cost management and engineering economics was evolving, with pioneering work by Hans Lang and others. In 1956, the American Association of Cost Engineers (now [[AACE International]]; the Association for the Advancement of [[Cost Engineering]]) was formed by early practitioners of project management and the associated specialties of planning and scheduling, cost estimating, and cost/schedule control (project control). AACE continued its pioneering work and in 2006 released the first integrated process for portfolio, program and project management ([[Total Cost Management|total cost management]] framework).

In 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Harrison, Dennis Lock (2004). ''Advanced project management: a structured approach''. Gower Publishing, Ltd., 2004. {{ISBN|0-566-07822-8}}. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; PMI publishes ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK Guide), which describes project management practices that are common to "most projects, most of the time." PMI also offers a range of certifications.

==Approaches==
There are a number of approaches to organizing and completing project activities, including: phased, lean, iterative, and incremental. There are also several extensions to project planning, for example based on outcomes (product-based) or activities (process-based).

A 2017 study suggested that the success of any project depends on how well four key aspects are aligned with the contextual dynamics affecting the project, these are referred to as the ''four P's'':&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New	York, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. ISBN 9 781498 757911.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Plan'': The planning and forecasting activities. 
* ''Process:'' The overall approach to all activities and project governance.
* ''People:'' Including dynamics of how they collaborate and communicate.
* ''Power:'' Lines of authority,  decision-makers, organograms, policies for implementation and the like.
Regardless of the [[methodology]] employed, careful consideration must be given to the overall project objectives, timeline, and cost, as well as the roles and responsibilities of all participants and [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. The Bridger (blog), [http://www.thebridger.co.uk/project-management-pmp-prince-2-or-an-iterative-or-agile-variant/ "Project management: PMP, Prince 2, or an Iterative or Agile variant"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phased approach ===
The phased (or staged) approach breaks down and manages the work through a series of distinct steps to be completed, and is often referred to as "traditional"&lt;ref name="wysocki"&gt;{{cite book | title=Effective Project Management: Traditional, Adaptive, Extreme (Seventh Edition) | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | author=Wysocki, Robert K | year=2013 | isbn=978-1118729168}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Waterfall model|waterfall]]".&lt;ref name="Roy70"&gt;Winston W. Royce (1970).

# [[project planning|planning]] and [[Systems design|design]]
# construction
# monitoring and controlling 
# completion or closing

Many industries use variations of these project stages and it is not uncommon for the stages to be renamed in order to better suit the organization. For example, when working on a [[brick-and-mortar]] design and construction, projects will typically progress through stages like pre-planning, conceptual design, schematic design, design development, construction drawings (or contract documents), and construction administration.

While the phased approach works well for small, well-defined projects, it often results in challenge or failure on larger projects, or those that are more complex or have more ambiguities, issues and risk.&lt;ref name="Stellman05"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209011617/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | archivedate=2015-02-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lean project management===
{{Main |Lean project management}}
Lean project management uses the principles from [[lean manufacturing]] to focus on delivering value with less waste and reduced time.

===Iterative and incremental project management===
{{See also|Iterative and incremental development}}In critical studies of project management it has been noted that phased approaches are not well suited for projects which are large-scale and multi-company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.projecttimes.com/articles/managing-complex-projects-that-are-too-large-too-long-and-too-costly.html|title=Managing Complex Projects that are Too Large, Too Long and Too Costly|last=Hass|first=Kathleen B.

These complexities are better handled with a more exploratory or iterative and incremental approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making|title=A Leader’s Framework for Decision Making|last=Snowden|first=David J.|date=November 2007|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-06-27|last2=Boone|first2=Mary E.|author-link=Dave Snowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models of iterative and incremental project management have evolved, including [[Agile Project Management|agile project management]], [[dynamic systems development method]], [[extreme project management]], and Innovation Engineering®.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://innovationengineering.org/news/stanford-researchers-rate-innovation-engineering-as-breakout-innovation-system/|title=Stanford Research Study Finds Innovation Engineering is a true "Breakout Innovation" System|last=|first=|date=June 20, 2017|work=IE News|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical chain project management===
{{Main |Critical chain project management}}
Critical chain project management (CCPM) is an application of the [[theory of constraints]] (TOC) to planning and managing projects, and is designed to deal with the uncertainties inherent in managing projects, while taking into consideration limited availability of [[Resource (project management)|resources]] (physical, human skills, as well as management &amp; support capacity) needed to execute projects.

The goal is to increase the flow of projects in an organization ([[throughput]]). Applying the first three of the [[Theory of Constraints#The five focusing steps|five focusing steps]] of TOC, the system constraint for all projects, as well as the resources, are identified. To exploit the constraint, tasks on the critical chain are given priority over all other activities. Finally, projects are planned and managed to ensure that the resources are ready when the critical chain tasks must start, subordinating all other resources to the critical chain.

===Product-based planning===
{{Main |Product-based planning}}Product-based planning is a structured approach to project management, based on identifying all of the products (project [[deliverable]]s) that contribute to achieving the project objectives. As such, it defines a successful project as output-oriented rather than activity- or task-oriented.&lt;ref name="managing"&gt;Office for Government Commerce (1996) ''Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2'', p14&lt;/ref&gt; The most common implementation of this approach is [[PRINCE2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110822131357/http://www.ogc.gov.uk/methods_prince_2__background.asp OGC – PRINCE2 – Background]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process-based management===
{{Main |Process-based management}}
The incorporation of process-based management has been driven by the use of maturity models such as the [[OPM3]] and the [[CMMI]] (capability maturity model integration; see [[:Image:Capability Maturity Model.jpg|this example]] of a predecessor) and [[ISO/IEC 15504]] (SPICE – software process improvement and capability estimation). Unlike SEI's CMM, the OPM3 maturity model describes how to make project management processes capable of performing successfully, consistently, and predictably in order to enact the strategies of an organization.

=== Project production management ===
{{Main |Project production management}}
Project production management is the application of operations management to the delivery of capital projects. The Project production management framework is based on a project as a production system view, in which a project transforms inputs (raw materials, information, labor, plant &amp; machinery) into outputs (goods and services).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/834624541|title=Modern construction management|last=McCaffer|first=Ronald|last2=Harris|first2=Frank|date=|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=1118510186|location=|page=5|pages=|oclc=834624541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits realization management===
{{Main |Benefits realisation management}}
Benefits realization management (BRM) enhances normal project management techniques through a focus on outcomes (benefits) of a project rather than products or outputs, and then measuring the degree to which that is happening to keep a project on track.  This can help to reduce the risk of a completed project being a failure by delivering agreed upon requirements/outputs but failing to deliver the '''''benefits''''' of those requirements.

In addition, BRM practices aim to ensure the alignment between project outcomes and business strategies. The effectiveness of these practices is supported by recent research evidencing BRM practices influencing project success from a strategic perspective across different countries and industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serra | first1 = C. E. M. | last2 = Kunc | first2 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Benefits Realisation Management and its influence on project success and on the execution of business strategies | doi = 10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.03.011 | journal = International Journal of Project Management | volume = 33| issue = 1| pages = 53–66| url = http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/60436/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of delivering a project to requirements might be agreeing to deliver a computer system that will process staff data and manage payroll, holiday and staff personnel records. Under BRM the agreement might be to achieve a specified reduction in staff hours required to process and maintain staff data.

=== Earned value management ===
{{Main|Earned value management}}
Earned value management (EVM) extends project management with techniques to improve project monitoring. It illustrates project progress towards completion in terms of work and value (cost). [[Earned Schedule]] is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM.

[[File:Project development stages.jpg|thumb|230px|The project development stages&lt;ref name="VA03"&gt;{{cite web|work=VA Office of Information and Technology |year=2003 |url=http://www.ppoe.oit.va.gov/docs/VA_IT_PM_Guide.pdf |title=Project Management Guide |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114104001/http://www.ppoe.oit.va.gov/docs/VA_IT_PM_Guide.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally (depending on what project management methodology is being used), project management includes a number of elements: four to five project management process groups, and a control system. Regardless of the methodology or terminology used, the same basic project management processes or stages of development will be used. Major process groups generally include:&lt;ref name="PMI 10"&gt;[[Project Management Institute|PMI]] (2010). ''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' p.27-35&lt;/ref&gt;
* Initiation
* Planning 
* Production or execution
* Monitoring and controlling
* Closing

In project environments with a significant exploratory element (e.g., [[research and development]]), these stages may be supplemented with decision points (go/no go decisions) at which the project's continuation is debated and decided. An example is the [[Phase–gate model]].

===Initiating===
[[File:Initiating Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Initiating process group processes&lt;ref name="VA03"/&gt;]]
The initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nathan, Gerald Everett Jones (2003). ''PMP certification for dummies''. p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business’ needs. The key project controls needed here are an understanding of the business environment and making sure that all necessary controls are incorporated into the project. Any deficiencies should be reported and a recommendation should be made to fix them.

The initiating stage should include a plan that encompasses the following areas. These areas can be recorded in a series of documents called Project Initiation documents.
Project Initiation documents are a series of planned documents used to create order for the duration of the project. 
These tend to include: 
	
* project proposal (idea behind project, overall goal, duration)
* [[Scope (project management)|project scope]] (project direction and track)
* [[product breakdown structure]] (PBS) (a hierarchy of deliverables / outcomes and components thereof) 
* [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) (a hierarchy of the work to be done, down to daily tasks) 
* [[responsibility assignment matrix]] (RACI) (roles and responsibilities aligned to deliverables / outcomes) 
* tentative [[Project plan|project schedule]] (milestones, important dates, deadlines)
* analysis of business needs and [[requirement]]s against measurable goals
* review of the current [[business operations|operations]]
* [[financial analysis]] of the costs and benefits, including a [[budget]]
* [[stakeholder analysis]], including users and support personnel for the project
* [[project charter]] including costs, tasks, deliverables, and schedules
* [[SWOT analysis]]: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the business

===Planning===
After the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail (see [[:File:Planning Process Group Activities.jpg|example of a flow-chart]]).&lt;ref name="VA03"/&gt; The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project's chances of successfully accomplishing its goals.

[[Project planning]] generally consists of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author = [[Harold Kerzner]] | year = 2003 | title = Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling | edition = 8th | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 0-471-22577-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* determining the project management methodology to follow (e.g. whether the plan will be defined [[Waterfall model|wholly up front]], [[Iterative and incremental development|iteratively]], or in [[Rolling-wave planning|rolling waves]]);
* developing the [[scope statement]];
* selecting the planning team;
* identifying deliverables and creating the product and work breakdown structures;
* identifying the activities needed to complete those deliverables and networking the activities in their logical sequence;
* estimating the resource requirements for the activities;
* estimating time and cost for activities;
* developing the schedule;
* developing the budget;
* risk planning;
* developing quality assurance measures;
* gaining formal approval to begin work.

Additional processes, such as planning for communications and for scope management, identifying roles and responsibilities, determining what to purchase for the project and holding a kick-off meeting are also generally advisable.

For [[new product development]] projects, conceptual design of the operation of the final product may be performed concurrent with the project planning activities, and may help to inform the planning team when identifying deliverables and planning activities.

===Executing===
[[File:Executing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Executing process group processes&lt;ref name="VA03"/&gt;]]
'''While executing we must know what are the planned terms that need to be executed'''.
The execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan's deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.

===Project Documentation===

Documenting everything within a project is key to being successful. In order to maintain budget, scope, effectiveness and pace a project must have physical documents pertaining to each specific task. With correct documentation, it is easy to see whether or not a project's requirement has been met. To go along with that, documentation provides information regarding what has already been completed for that project. Documentation throughout a project provides a paper trail for anyone who needs to go back and reference the work in the past. 
In most cases, documentation is the most successful way to monitor and control the specific phases of a project.  With the correct documentation, a project's success can be tracked and observed as the project goes on. If performed correctly documentation can be the backbone to a project's success.

===Monitoring and controlling===
[[File:Monitoring and Controlling Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Monitoring and controlling process group processes&lt;ref name="VA03"/&gt;]]Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan..

Monitoring and controlling includes:&lt;ref name="JPL00"&gt;James P. Lewis (2000). ''The project manager's desk reference: : a comprehensive guide to project planning, scheduling, evaluation, and systems.'' p.185&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measuring the ongoing project activities ('where we are');
* Monitoring the project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project management plan and the project performance baseline (''where we should be'');
* Identifying corrective actions to address issues and risks properly (''How can we get on track again'');
* Influencing the factors that could circumvent integrated change control so only approved changes are implemented.

In multi-phase projects, the monitoring and control process also provides feedback between project phases, in order to implement corrective or preventive actions to bring the project into compliance with the project management plan.

Project maintenance is an ongoing process, and it includes:&lt;ref name="PMI 10"/&gt;
* Continuing support of end-users
* Correction of errors
* Updates to the product over time
[[File:Project Management (project control).png|thumb|240px|Monitoring and controlling cycle]]
In this stage, [[auditor]]s should pay attention to how effectively and quickly user problems are resolved.

Over the course of any construction project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can be the result of necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, "as built." The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industry's maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.

When changes are introduced to the project, the viability of the project has to be re-assessed. It is important not to lose sight of the initial goals and targets of the projects. When the changes accumulate, the forecasted result may not justify the original proposed investment in the project. Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.

===Closing===
[[File:Closing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|270px|Closing process group processes.&lt;ref name="VA03"/&gt;]]
Closing includes the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof.  Administrative activities include the archiving of the files and documenting lessons learned.

This phase consists of:&lt;ref name="PMI 10"/&gt;
* '''Contract closure''': Complete and settle each contract (including the resolution of any open items) and close each contract applicable to the project or project phase.
* '''Project close''': Finalize all activities across all of the process groups to formally close the project or a project phase

Also included in this phase is the Post Implementation Review. This is a vital phase of the project for the project team to learn from experiences and apply to future projects. Normally a Post Implementation Review consists of looking at things that went well and analyzing things that went badly on the project to come up with lessons learned.

===Project controlling and project control systems===
Project controlling (also known as [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svrtechnologies.com/project-management |title=Project Management planning activities Guide |date=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
should be established as an independent function in project management. It implements verification and controlling function during the processing of a project in order to reinforce the defined performance and formal goals.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Becker, Martin Kugeler, Michael Rosemann (2003). Process management: a guide for the design of business processes. {{ISBN|978-3-540-43499-3}}. p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The tasks of project controlling are also: 
* the creation of infrastructure for the supply of the right information and its update
* the establishment of a way to communicate disparities of project parameters
* the development of project information technology based on an intranet or the determination of a project key performance indicator system (KPI)
* divergence analyses and generation of proposals for potential project regulations&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Schlagheck (2000). Objektorientierte Referenzmodelle für das Prozess- und Projektcontrolling. Grundlagen – Konstruktionen – Anwendungsmöglichkeiten. {{ISBN|978-3-8244-7162-1}}. p.131.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the establishment of methods to accomplish an appropriate project structure, project workflow organization, project control and governance
* creation of transparency among the project parameters&lt;ref&gt;Josef E. Riedl (1990). Projekt – Controlling in Forschung und Entwicklung. {{ISBN|978-3-540-51963-8}}. p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulfillment and implementation of these tasks can be achieved by applying specific methods and instruments of project controlling. The following methods of project controlling can be applied: 
 
* investment analysis
* cost–benefit analysis
* value benefit analysis
* expert surveys
* simulation calculations
* risk-profile analysis
* surcharge calculations
* [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]] trend analysis
* cost trend analysis
* target/actual-comparison&lt;ref&gt;Steinle, Bruch, Lawa (1995). Projektmanagement. FAZ Verlagsbereich Wirtschaftsbücher. p.136–143&lt;/ref&gt;

Project control is that element of a project that keeps it on track, on-time and within budget.&lt;ref name="JPL00"/&gt;  Project control begins early in the project with planning and ends late in the project with post-implementation review, having a thorough involvement of each step in the process.  Projects may be audited or reviewed while the project is in progress. Formal audits are generally risk or compliance-based and management will direct the objectives of the audit. An examination may include a comparison of approved project management processes with how the project is actually being managed.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Snyder, Frank Parth (2006). ''Introduction to IT Project Management.'' p.393-397&lt;/ref&gt; Each project should be assessed for the appropriate level of control needed: too much control is too time consuming, too little control is very risky.  If project control is not implemented correctly, the cost to the business should be clarified in terms of errors and fixes.

Control systems are needed for cost, [[risk]], quality, communication, time, change, procurement, and human resources.  In addition, auditors should consider how important the projects are to the [[financial statement]]s, how reliant the stakeholders are on controls, and how many controls exist.  Auditors should review the development process and procedures for how they are implemented.  The process of development and the quality of the final product may also be assessed if needed or requested.  A business may want the auditing firm to be involved throughout the process to catch problems earlier on so that they can be fixed more easily.  An auditor can serve as a controls consultant as part of the development team or as an independent auditor as part of an audit.

Businesses sometimes use formal systems development processes.  These help assure systems are developed successfully.  A formal process is more effective in creating strong controls, and auditors should review this process to confirm that it is well designed and is followed in practice.  A good formal systems development plan outlines:
* A [[strategy]] to align development with the organization's broader objectives
* Standards for new systems
* Project management policies for timing and [[budgeting]]
* Procedures describing the process
* Evaluation of quality of change

==Topics==

=== Characteristics of projects ===
There are five important characteristics of a project. (i) It should always have a specific start and end dates. (ii) They are performed and completed by a group of people. (iii) The output is delivery on unique product or service. (iv) They are temporary in nature. (v) It is progressively elaborated. example: Designing a new car, writing a book.

=== Project Complexity ===
Complexity and its nature plays an important role in the area of project management. Despite having number of debates on this subject matter, studies suggest lack of definition and reasonable understanding of complexity in relation to management of complex projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdou|first=Saed M|last2=Yong|first2=Kuan|last3=Othman|first3=Mohammed|date=2016|title=Project Complexity Influence on Project management performance – The Malaysian perspective|journal=MATEC Web of Conferences|language=en|volume=66|pages=00065|doi=10.1051/matecconf/20166600065|issn=2261-236X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is considered that project complexity and project performance are closely related, it is important to define and measure complexity of the project for project management to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ludovic‐Alexandre Vidal, Franck Marle|first=Vidal|date=2008|title=Understanding project complexity: implications on project management|journal=Kybernetes|volume= 37| issue =  8|pages=1094–1110|doi=10.1108/03684920810884928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By applying the discovery in measuring work complexity described in [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] and Stratified Systems Theory, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr Elliott Jaques]] classifies projects and project work (stages, tasks) into basic 7 levels of project complexity based on such criteria as time-span of discretion and complexity of a project’s output:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The management of projects|last=G.|first=Morris, Peter W.|date=1994|publisher=T. Telford|isbn=978-0727725936|location=London|pages=317|oclc=30437274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gower handbook of people in project management|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Gower Publishing|others=Lock, Dennis., Scott, Lindsay, 1974-|isbn=978-1409437857|location=Farnham, Surrey|pages=398|oclc=855019788}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level 1 Project – improve the direct output of an activity (quantity, quality, time)  within a business process with targeted completion time up to 3 months.
* Level 2 Project – develop and improve compliance to a business process with targeted completion time from 3 months to 1 year.
* Level 3 Project – develop, change and improve a business process with targeted completion time from 1 to 2 years.
* Level 4 Project – develop, change and improve a functional system with targeted completion time from 2 to 5 years.
* Level 5 Project – develop, change and improve a group of functional systems / business function with targeted completion time from 5 to 10 years.
* Level 6 Project – develop, change and improve  a whole single value chain of a company with targeted completion time from 10 to 20 years.
* Level 7 Project – develop, change and improve multiple value chains of a company with target completion time from 20 to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theprojectmanager.co.za/articles/pmos-12444.html|title=PMOs|website=www.theprojectmanager.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benefits from measuring Project Complexity is to improve project people feasibility by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/optimal-management-structures|title=APS framework for optimal management structures|last=Commission|first=Australian Public Service|last2=Commission|first2=Australian Public Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Match the level of a project’s complexity with effective targeted completion time of a project
* Match the level of a project’s complexity with the respective capability level of the project manager
* Match the level of a project task’s complexity with the respective capability of the project members

=== Project managers ===
A [[project manager]] is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers are in charge of the people in a project. People are the key to any successful project. Without the correct people in the right place and at the right time a project cannot be successful. Project managers can have the responsibility of the planning, execution, controlling, and closing of any project typically relating to the [[construction industry]], engineering, architecture, [[computing]], and telecommunications. Many other fields of production engineering, design engineering, and heavy industrial have project managers.

A project manager needs to understand the order of execution of a project to schedule the project correctly as well as the time necessary to accomplish each individual task within the project. A project manager is the person accountable for accomplishing the stated project objectives. Project Managers tend to have multiple years’ experience in their field. A project manager is required to know the project in and out while supervising the workers along with the project. Typically in most construction, engineering, architecture and industrial projects, a project manager has another manager working alongside of them who is typically responsible for the execution of task on a daily basis. This position in some cases is known as a superintendent.  A superintendent and project manager work hand in hand in completing daily project task. Key project management responsibilities include creating clear and attainable project objectives, building the project requirements, and managing the [[Project management triangle|triple constraint]] (now including more constraints and calling it competing constraints) for projects, which is cost, time, and scope for the first three but about three additional ones in current project management. A typical project is composed of a team of workers who work under the project manager to complete the assignment. A project manager normally reports directly to someone of higher stature on the completion and success of the project.

A project manager is often a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the contracting party, and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.

===Project management types===
Project management can apply to any project, but it is often tailored to accommodate the specific needs of different and highly specialized industries.  For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery of things like buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as ''construction project management'' and in which project managers can become trained and certified.&lt;ref name=Contruction_Project_Management&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Construction Manager|url=http://cmaanet.org/certified-construction-manager|publisher=CMAA|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of project management that is referred to as ''IT project management'' and which specializes in the delivery of technical assets and services that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. ''Biotechnology project management'' focuses on the intricacies of biotechnology research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate in Biotechnology Project Management|url=http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/biotechnology-project-management.html|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Localization project management'' includes many standard project management practices even though many consider this type of management to be a very different discipline. It focuses on three important goals: time, quality and budget. Successful projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and according to previously agreed quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Practical Guide to Localization|last=Esselink|first=Bert|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2000|isbn=978-9-027-21956-5 |location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each type of project management, project managers develop and utilize repeatable templates that are specific to the industry they're dealing with.  This allows project plans to become very thorough and highly repeatable, with the specific intent to increase quality, lower delivery costs, and lower time to deliver project results.

=== Project management success criteria ===
There is a tendency to confuse the project success with project management success. They are two different things. Project management success criteria is different from project success criteria. The project management is said to be successful if the given project is completed within the agreed upon time, met the agreed upon scope and within the agreed upon budget. Meanwhile, a project is said to be successful, when it succeeds in achieving the expected business case.

===Risk management===
{{Main |Project risk management}}

[[File: SimulTrain12RiskRegister.JPG|thumb| An example of the Risk Register that includes 4 steps: Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management What Is Risk Management?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The United States Department of Defense states; "Cost, Schedule, Performance, and Risk," are the four elements through which Department of Defense acquisition professionals make trade-offs and track program status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DoDD 5000.01|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500001p.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Project management#International standards|international standards]].  Risk management applies proactive identification (see [[Risk management tools|tools]]) of future problems and understanding of their consequences allowing [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] decisions about projects.

===Work breakdown structure===
{{Main |Work breakdown structure}}
The [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) is a [[tree structure]] that shows a subdivision of the activities required to achieve an objective—for example a program, project, and contract. The WBS may be hardware-, product-, service-, or [[Business process|process]]-oriented (see an example in a [[:Image:NASA NF 533 reporting structure.jpg|NASA reporting structure (2001)]]).&lt;ref name="NASA01"&gt;[http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_9501_002D_&amp;page_name=Chp2&amp;format=PDF NASA NPR 9501.2D]. May 23, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

A WBS can be developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable components in terms of size, [[Duration (project management)|duration]], and responsibility (e.g., systems, subsystems, components, tasks, sub-tasks, and work packages), which include all steps necessary to achieve the objective.&lt;ref name="Stellman05"/&gt;

The work breakdown structure provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a contract and is the basis for dividing work into definable increments from which the statement of work can be developed and technical, schedule, cost, and labor hour reporting can be established.&lt;ref name="NASA01"/&gt;
The work breakdown structure can be displayed in two forms, as a table with subdivision of tasks or as an organisational chart whose lowest nodes are referred to as "work packages".

It is an essential element in assessing the quality of a plan, and an initial element used during the planning of the project. For example, a WBS is used when the project is scheduled, so that the use of work packages can be recorded and tracked.

===International standards===
There have been several attempts to develop project management standards, such as:
* [[ISO 21500]]:2012 – Guidance on project management.  This is the first project management ISO.
* [[ISO 31000]]:2009 – Risk management. Risk management is 1 of the 10 knowledge areas of either ISO 21500 or PMBoK5 concept of project management.
* ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009 – Systems and Software Engineering—Life Cycle Processes—Project Management&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326-2009  –   Systems and Software Engineering--Life Cycle Processes--Project Management.

===Project portfolio management===
{{Main |Project portfolio management}}
An increasing number of organizations are using what is referred to as [[project portfolio management]] (PPM) as a means of selecting the right projects and then using project management techniques&lt;ref name="AH04"&gt;Albert Hamilton (2004). ''Handbook of Project Management Procedures.'' TTL Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7277-3258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the means for delivering the outcomes in the form of benefits to the performing private or not-for-profit organization. PPM is usually performed by a dedicated team of managers organized by within a Project Management Office (PMO), usually based within the organization.

===Project management software===
{{main|Project management software|Project management information system}}
[[Project management software]] is software used to help plan, organize, and manage resource pools, develop resource estimates and implement plans. Depending on the sophistication of the software, functionality may include [[Software development effort estimation|estimation]] and planning, [[Schedule (workplace)|scheduling]], [[cost control]] and [[budget management]], [[resource allocation]], [[collaboration software]], [[communication]], [[Decision-making software|decision-making]], [[workflow management system|workflow]], [[Risk management tools|risk]], quality, [[documentation]] and/or administration systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PMBOK 4h Ed.|page=443|isbn=978-1933890517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Kendrick.

===Virtual project management===
{{main|Virtual team}}
Virtual program management (VPM) is management of a project done by a [[virtual team]], though it rarely may refer to a project implementing a virtual environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''''Provincial Fisheries Reference''''' was a lawsuit decided in 1898 by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC). It arose from a government turf war in Canada over the jurisdictional boundaries of property rights in relation to rivers, lakes, harbours, fisheries, and other cognate subjects.  The 12-page judgment was delivered by [[Lord Hershell]], and followed on from [[List of New Brunswick case law|''R v Robertson'' (1882)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1898/1898_30.html bailii.org: "The Attorneys General for the Provinces of Ontario v The Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada (Canada)] [1898] UKPC 30 (26 May 1898)&lt;/ref&gt; This one case in the JCPC was in reality an amalgamation of three separate [[Supreme Court of Canada]] appeals, which were grouped into one because of their similarities.  The judgment broke little ground, and can be considered a ringing affirmation of the [[Samuel Henry Strong|Strong court]].{{according to whom|date=June 2017}}

'''Shanzhai''' or '''shan zhai''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|山寨}}|p={{linktext|shānzhài}}|j=saan1 zaai6}}) refers to [[counterfeit consumer goods]], including imitation and trademark infringing brands and/or particularly electronics, in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidle|first=Nicholas|title=Inside the Knockoff-Tennis-Shoe Factory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22fake-t.html|accessdate=8 September 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Literally "mountain village" or "mountain stronghold", the term refers to the mountain stockades of regional warlords or bandits, far away from official control. "Shanzhai" can also be stretched to refer to people who are lookalikes, low-quality or improved goods, as well as things done in [[parody]].

==Origin==
According to the ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Dictionary]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=现代汉语词典/現代漢語詞典|s=|t=|labels=no}}), "Shanzhai" can stand for two meanings:
# A fenced place in the forest.
# Villages in the mountain that have stockade houses.

Historically, "shanzhai" is sometimes used as a metaphor to describe bandits who oppose and evade the corrupted authority to perform deeds they see as justified. One example of such bandits is the story of ''[[Water Margin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/268947.html?wtp=tt |title=Baidu Encyclopedia "Shanzhai" |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "Shanzhai" to refer to imitation products comes from [[Cantonese]] slang, in which "shanzhai factory" means an ill-equipped, low-end and family-based factory. However, with the accumulation of profit, quite a few of those factories invest a lot of money to improve their equipment. Some factories also get investment from someone other than family members. Nowadays, a significant portion of Shanzhai factories are no longer ill-equipped or family-based. 

Their products are no longer poor-quality. Yet they still can not escape from the fate of no-brand (or fake brand), not-for-sale in top department stores with non-''shanzha''i products.  One of the motivations for going 'Shanzhai' is the difficult regulations the Chinese government had established to become an official mobile phone manufacturer.  So to avoid the hassles companies try to operate under the radar.  They can avoid taxes and regulation in this way.

Another account of the origin is that because imitation electronic appliance manufacturers are largely located in [[Shenzhen]], wholesalers from other parts of China started calling their products "Shenzhen product". Gradually "Shenzhen product" became "Shanzhai product" because they sound similar when people speak [[mandarin Chinese]] with a Cantonese accent.

==Shanzhai products==
The use of "shanzhai" became popular with the outstanding sale performance of "shanzhai" mobile phones. According to [[Gartner]]’s data, 1.15 billion mobile phones were sold worldwide in 2007, and according to data provided by the Chinese government, 150 million "Shanzhai" mobile phones were sold in the same year, thus making up more than one tenth of the global sales.&lt;ref name="Shanzhai’s Destruction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.163.com/09/0420/10/57BBE6EL0009388P.html |title=Shanzhai’s Destruction |publisher=Tech.163.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Financial Times estimated that Shanzhai phones accounted for about 20 per cent of the global [[2G]] mobile phone market.&lt;ref name=mediatek&gt;{{Cite web
 |url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bandit-phone-king-has-the-last-laugh-ftimes-34bef9cc11fc.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for "shanzhai" mobile phones is not only in China, but are also found in the surrounding developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The outstanding sales performance of "shanzhai" mobile phones is usually attributed to their low price, multifunctional performance and imitations of trendy mobile phone design. Although "shanzhai" companies do not use branding as a marketing strategy, they are known for their flexibility of design to meet specific market needs. For example, during [[Barack Obama]]’s 2008 U.S. presidential election campaign, "shanzhai" mobile phone companies started selling "Obama" mobile phones in [[Kenya]], with the slogan "yes we can" and Obama’s name on the back of the mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3zai.org.cn/shanzhai/shanzhaishouji/2009-01/136.html|title=Obama Brand Shanzhai Cell Phone|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also designed "[[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest]]" ({{Lang-zh|c=鸟窝|s=|t=|labels=no}}) and "[[Fuwa]]" ({{Lang-zh|c=福娃|s=|t=|labels=no}}) mobile phones in light of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympic Games]].

Before the booming shanzhai mobile phone industries, since the early 2000s, imitation electronic products such as DVD players and [[MP3 player|MP3]] players were already manufactured in the [[Pearl River Delta]] ({{Lang-zh|c=珠三角|s=|t=|labels=no}}) area.&lt;ref name="Shanzhai’s Destruction"/&gt; Many shanzhai mobile phone companies accumulated their capital in that process.  After understanding that many buyers  prefer lookalike phones without the blaring of fake logos, many manufacturers adopted a practice of not using fraudulent logos. They instead opt for a generically designed logo. This allows overseas buyers to find a lookalike phone easily, without the fake logo.

Shanzhai mobile phones can be sold at very low prices compared to other mobile phones. On average, the imitations sell at retailers at about $US100-$US150, while production costs are about $US20.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barboza|first=David|title=In China, Knockoff Cellphones Are a Hit|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2009-04-27|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/technology/28cell.html?hpw|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanzhai mobile phone factories are able to manufacture at a very low cost for two reasons, they do not buy mobile phone manufacture licenses from the Chinese government, thus saving all the related costs.

CECT is one of the many brands of [[cellular phone]]s manufactured in [[China]].

One company that earned notoriety for producing shanzhai smartphones is [[Goophone]], which in 2012 was reported to have filed a patent for the "Goophone i5", a [[MediaTek]]-powered clone marketed prior to the real [[iPhone 5]]'s official release.&lt;ref name="Hodgkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/16/wico-goophone-iphone-6-clones/|title=Wico and Goophone Beat Apple to Market with Android-Based iPhone 6 Clones|last=Hodgkins|first=Kelly|date=16 July 2014|work=[[MacRumors]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many fake garments, watches, bags, and shoes in China, they are not called "shanzhai" products, perhaps because these fake products came into existence earlier than fake mobile phones and the newer use of the term "shanzhai". "Shanzhai" mobile phones may stand out as the most successful and most often discussed "shanzhai" products, because mobile phones strongly symbolise wealth in China, but they are much more affordable than other symbolic signs of wealth such as cars and apartments.

Quite a few shanzhai mobile phone companies tried to exploit the market by making shanzhai [[Netbooks]], but these gained little market acceptance and sales.

"Shanzhai" electric cars, which run on lead-acid batteries and sell for as little as $US2000-$US3000, are being produced in the Shandong province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.asiasociety.org/chinagreen/shanzhai-electric-car-revolution/ |title=Shanzhai Electric Car Revolution 山寨电动汽车革命|publisher=China Green|date= |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce announced a crackdown on shanzhai phone sellers and manufacturers. The administration blamed "money-stealing" services that used the cheap phones to steal services using customers' SIM cards. Industry commentator Liu Sheng said that it was more likely to be linked to the country's intellectual property rights protection campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Shanzhaiism==
Shanzhaiism ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨主義|s=|t=|labels=no}}) is a philosophical term denoting a Chinese style of innovation with a peasant mind-set. 

Shanzhaiism has an equivalent English term: tinker. Lacking a garage, they build products in villages in the mountains that have stockade houses. However, with shanzhaiism in mind, people can produce fake and counterfeit products in a massively organized way.

Shanzhaiism can be analyzed using a term coined by Jean-Paul Sartre: [[Bad faith (existentialism)|Bad faith]]. Fake and unlicensed products are produced. For example, there was once a so-called  Fake-One Road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/ada2aje/6RDAUWHUWeg#!topic/ada2aje/6RDAUWHUWeg|title=Whole street of Fake Famous brand name shops to be opened in China - Wenan Jie|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120223062019/http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/jw!m3yjq.KQGRu5wWDGLuhCpQ--/article?mid=989&amp;prev=990&amp;next=976 Nanjing Shanzhai Street (南京山寨一條街,真是大開眼界..山寨手機/山寨家電/山寨電腦..等等.還有其他的山寨版品牌,以後可以在大陸一次買足 - 雅登廚飾/廚具設計/系統櫥櫃/美國/荷蘭廚房家電--雲林/嘉義生活館) - tw.myblog.yahoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨一條街|s=|t=|labels=no}}) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408997/Wanda-Plaza-China-lined-counterfeit-brands-called-knock-alley.html|title=Fancy a cheap Starbocks or some Häagen Dezs ice cream?

This kind of phenomena is not confined to fake products. The mind set of shanzhaiism even extends to advertisements. For example, a [https://web.archive.org/web/20121220153346/http://www.clonedinchina.com/2009/06/spokeman-obama-and-a-blackberry-storm-9500-clone.html shanzhai phone advertisement] used the former president of the United States, Obama, to promote its shanzhai products.

==Shanzhai culture==

The frequent reference to shanzhai cell phones on internet and in traditional media made people start labeling low-cost imitation cultural activities as shanzhai as well. Some of the most well-known events include the [[Shanzhai National Spring Gala]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨春节联欢晚会|s=|t=|labels=no}}), Shanzhai Lecture Room ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨百家讲坛|s=|t=|labels=no}}), Shanzhai Olympic Torch Relay ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨奥运火炬传递|s=|t=|labels=no}}), and Shanzhai Nobel Prize ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨诺贝尔奖|s=|t=|labels=no}}). One thing these events have in common is that they all imitate high-end, popular yet authoritative events in which grass-roots power usually has no participating role.

While the purpose of the above-mentioned shanzhai events is arguably just for the participants to have fun and to experience being the authority, other shanzhai cultural phenomena, like the shanzhai products, are profit-oriented. For example, some low-end performing agencies will hire [[Doppelgänger|people who look like pop stars]] to perform in rural areas, where people cannot afford to watch the actual stars. Thus shanzhai [[Jay Chou]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨周杰伦|s=|t=|labels=no}}), shanzhai [[Andy Lau]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨刘德华|s=|t=|labels=no}}) and shanzhai [[Faye Wong]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨王菲|s=|t=|labels=no}}) appear in many underdeveloped places in China.

Shanzhai movies are another profit-driven shanzhai phenomenon. These movies usually have low budgets, yet achieve commercial success by [[parody]]ing, making fun of or borrowing elements from high-end [[Hollywood]] blockbuster movies. One of the first shanzhai movies is [[Ning Hao]]’s ({{Lang-zh|c=宁浩|s=|t=|labels=no}}) ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=疯狂的石头|s=|t=|labels=no}}). It imitates the multi-angle shooting, rapid cutting and stunts that are usually used in Hollywood action movies, yet it retains the grass-roots Chinese set up. With a 3 million Hong Kong dollar budget, ''Crazy Stone'' achieved 22 million-box-office revenue. Following its success, shanzhai movies like "the Big Movie" series ("{{Lang-zh|c=大电影"系列|s=|t=|labels=no}}") and ''No.2 in the World'' ({{Lang-zh|c=天下第二|s=|t=|labels=no}}) were made. Some also argue that Hollywood parody movies like ''[[Scary Movie]]'' are the true inspirational force behind shanzhai movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanzhaihuo.com/chinanews/shanzhai-movie-yuanzihaolaiwu-fengkuangdeshitoushibizu.html |title="Shanzhai" Movie is From Hollywood; the "Crazy Stone" is Their Ancestor |publisher=Shanzhaihuo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The heated online debate about whether shanzhai should be encouraged or denounced is arguably due to Ni Ping ({{lang|zh|倪萍}}), a well-known [[China Central Television|CCTV]] host's proposal during the [[Lianghui]] (two conferences) this year.{{which|date=December 2012}} She proposed to establish relevant legislation that will eliminate the shanzhai phenomenon by arguing that the copycat culture associated with shanzhai will stifle genuine creativity and hamper awareness of property rights. While some agree with her, others point out that in order to give objective comment on the shanzhai phenomenon, one has to distinguish shanzhai products from "pirated" products and shanzhai culture from shanzhai products. They also argue that although many shanzhai culture events manifest themselves as copycat events, some also have true original elements. Western media outlets like ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123257138952903561|title=Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Rebellion in China|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|author=Sky Canaves and Juliet Ye|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2009/03/a-chinese-pirat.html|title=A Chinese Pirate Unmasks|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|author=Evan Osnos|authorlink=Evan Osnos|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported about the shanzhai phenomenon and presented it as a form of rebellion and resistance to the mainstream culture.

'''Arvin Jimenez''' (March 24, 1974 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2014), known [[mononym]]ously as '''Tado''', was a Filipino comedian, actor, radio personality, businessman, published author and activist. His nickname "Tado" comes from a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] expletive he frequently blurts out.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |first=Perry Gil |last=Mallari |title=Tado Jimenez seriously |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/sep/07/yehey/weekend/20080907week1.html |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=2008-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830060731/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/sep/07/yehey/weekend/20080907week1.html |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tado was primarily known for the offbeat television program ''[[Strangebrew]]'' and the [[DWFM|U92]] radio program ''The BrewRATs!''.

==Early life and career==
Prior to fame, Tado had worked on various odd jobs such as a staff in a mental hospital, a [[waiter]], a [[scriptwriter]] for television and a [[photojournalist]]. Tado graduated from the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] (PUP) with a degree in [[Psychology]]. He was an active member of Scouts Royale Brotherhood (SRB) International Service Fraternity and Sorority under the waving banner of Beta Tau Chapter. He was engaged in social issues as a student organizer of [[Sanlakas party-list|Sanlakas]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

While in PUP, Tado was influenced by his artist friends, causing him to be involved in theater, painting and photography. This led to the founding of the now-defunct PUP-based cultural organization called PANDAY PIRA (Pandayan ng Pilipinong Kultura). He eventually studied film making at the [[Mowelfund Institute]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Tado later co-founded Dakila ("Noble"), an artists group aiming to instill modern-day heroism in everyday people, with poet [[Lourd de Veyra]], bassist for [[Parokya ni Edgar]], [[Buwi Meneses]] and acclaimed actor, [[Ronnie Lazaro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agimat Launches a Central Website for Filipino Artists|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/sosy/sosy/view/20080807-153224/Agimat-Launches-a-Central-Website-for-Filipino-Artists|work=[[The Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=2008-08-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001033951/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/sosy/sosy/view/20080807-153224/Agimat-Launches-a-Central-Website-for-Filipino-Artists|archivedate=2009-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tado also dabbled in music, and had appeared with the band [[The Youth (band)|The Youth]] as their lead vocalist with original vocalist Dodong Cruz's consent. He and the band appeared on the [[GMA Network]] program ''[[Unang Hirit]]'', singing the band's hit "''Multong Bakla''" ("gay ghost").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Youth (?) |url=http://www.unanghirit.tv/?p=630 |work=Unanghirit.tv |date=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strangebrew==
Tado became involved in television with the premiere of the off-the-wall magazine show ''[[Strangebrew]]'' in the then-[[NU 107]] operated [[DWAO-TV|UNTV Channel 37]], with Angel Rivero as his co-host, in 2001. His maroon [[Volkswagen Beetle]] took him and Rivero throughout Metro Manila on an adventure with "a unique cartoony look, a caustic wit" with "a weird sense of humor."&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

Strangebrew and Tado became a cult hit until the show was canceled a year later, with him enshrined as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

In almost all episodes whenever they interview a certain person, Tado throws his famous question ''"Kuya/ate, sa tagal mo nang ginagawa itong trabaho na ito, umibig ka na ba?"''

==The BrewRATs!==
He was reunited with Rivero (along with occasional ''Strangebrew'' contributor, [[Ramon Bautista]]) in [[DWRT-FM|Hit 99.5 FM]] (now 99.5 Play FM's) late night talk show ''The BrewRATs!''&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; in which is a pun on the Tagalog slang of the male genitalia. Even with Hit FM's reformatting to 99.5 Campus FM and finally reverting to its old 99.5 RT callsign, the show was consistently placed on the station's roster of shows, and consistently occupying the late night slot until it was moved to the morning slot from August to September 2009.

On October 1, 2009, ''The BrewRATs!'' resurfaced on [[DWFM|U92]], the radio affiliate of [[MTV Philippines]], of which Bautista was a personality of (''The Ramon Bautista Show''). It went off the air a second time as a result of U92's reformat to Radyo5 92.3 News FM and has since become a show at the internet radio station DigRadio every Thursday from 9 PM to midnight.&lt;ref&gt;http://pinoytuner.com/article/191/the-brewrats-are-coming  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824123156/http://pinoytuner.com/article/191/the-brewrats-are-coming |date=August 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pinoytuner.com/popout/192/watch-brewrats  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824123346/http://pinoytuner.com/popout/192/watch-brewrats |date=August 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LimiTado==
Aside from radio, Tado also designed ''LimiTado'' ("Limited"), and ran it with his wife. The graphic [[T-shirt]]s' main selling points are striking messages printed on the shirt and spoofs. Other items include bags, accessories and toy collectibles such as Volkswagen die-casts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pam |last=Pastor |title=The gospel of Tado’s T-shirts |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/2bu/view/20070717-77169/The_gospel_of_Tado%92s_T-shirts |work=INQUIRER.net |date=2007-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717234910/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/2bu/view/20070717-77169/The_gospel_of_Tado%92s_T-shirts |archivedate=2012-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a [[tattoo]] shop.

==Political life==
Tado [[Marikina local elections, 2010#District 1|ran for the position of city councilor]] of Marikina's 1st District (coextensive with [[Legislative districts of Marikina City#1st District|Marikina's 1st congressional district]]) in 2010 as an [[independent (politician)|independent candidate]]. He finished eleventh; the first eight in the tally were elected.

Tado was involved in protest actions of the [[Sanlakas party-list|Sanlakas]] political bloc such as the campaign against rising electricity rates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2012/11/26/873735/congress-urged-repeal-epira-law Congress urged to repeal EPIRA law | Headlines, News, The Philippine Star | philstar.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrations against [[Constitutional reform in the Philippines|Charter Change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/inquirerpolitics/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090610-209768 INQUIRER Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606002722/http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/inquirerpolitics/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090610-209768 |date=2013-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the picket protest of the workers of Philippine Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hronlineph.com/2011/11/27/press-release-tado-mag-eemcee-sa-concert-para-sa-palea/ [Press Release&amp;#93; Tado mag-eemcee sa concert para sa PALEA | Human Rights Online Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also seen visiting Sulu Sultan [[Jamalul Kiram III]], expressing his support in the [[2013 Lahad Datu standoff|Sulu Sultanate's claim]] over [[North Borneo dispute|Sabah, North Borneo]]. He also joined the demonstration against the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund]], known as [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam|Pork barrel]].

Tado ran again for the position of [[Marikina local elections, 2013#District 1|city councilor]] of Marikina's 1st District in 2013 as a candidate under [[Partido Lakas ng Masa]]. This would be the second time he lost in the election, finishing at eleventh yet again.

== Death ==

Tado died on February 7, 2014 in an [[2014 Mountain Province Bus Accident|accident]] when a [[GV Florida Transport]] bus fell off a road in Sitio Paggang, [[Talubin]], [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Mountain Province]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/347387/news/regions/comedian-tado-among-14-dead-in-bus-crash-in-mt-province&lt;/ref&gt; In total, fourteen people were killed and more than 32 people were injured.

A '''web presence''' is a location on the [[World Wide Web]] where a person, business, or some other entity is represented (see also [[web property]] and [[point of presence]]).

Examples of a web presence for a person could be a personal [[website]], a [[blog]], a profile page, a wiki page, or a [[social media]] [[point of presence]] (e.g. a LinkedIn profile, a Facebook account, or a Twitter account). Examples of a web presence for a business or some other entity could be a corporate website, a [[microsite]], a page on a review site, a wiki page, or a social media point of presence (e.g., a LinkedIn company page and/or group, a Facebook business/brand/product page, or a Twitter account).

Every web presence is associated with a unique [[web address]] to distinguish one point of presence from another.

==Owned vs. unowned==
Web presence can either be owned or unowned. [[Earned media|Owned media]] exists when a single person or group can control the content that is published on its web presence (e.g. a corporate website or a personal Twitter account). However, when a single person or group cannot solely control the content, the creator is different from the owner. This is considered unowned media (see [[earned media]]). A Wikipedia or Yelp page about a person, company, or product would be an example of an unowned (or "earned") web presence.

Occasionally, a third form of media known as "paid media" is often included in the discussion of media types: "earned vs. owned vs. paid". Paid media is commonly found in the form of advertisements, but it is not considered a form of web presence.

==Management==
Web presence management is the process of establishing and maintaining a digital footprint on the web. The three factors that are considered include the following: ''where'' a person or business has web presence; ''how'' each web presence represents its enterprise; and ''what'' is published at a point of presence.

Web presence management is the discipline of determining and governing:
* the distribution of policy documents
* which platforms are most appropriate (e.g. internal vs. external blog, YouTube vs. Vimeo)
* the single inventory of personal or corporate web presence (e.g. partners or advocates)
* where on the web a business and any relatable assets are represented
* where on the web a business and any relatable assets are impersonated or pirated
* web properties with the particular entities they represent
* who has control over which web properties
* new web properties which are not in the personal or corporate inventory (e.g. someone creates a new presence)
* authorized and unauthorized changes to the creation (e.g. branding) of a web presence
* a workflow for creating a web property that follows its corporate standards

===Management system===
The purpose of a web presence management system is to manage the web presence of a person or business. This includes the collection of domain names, websites, social media, and other web pages where he, she, or it is being represented. The tool generally offers the following key functions: new presence discovery, inventory management, change detection, access control, stakeholder coordination, and compliance workflow.

A web presence management system is meant to have a broader reach so that it emphasizes where a presence has been established, will be established, must be maintained, or must be remediated. An example of a web presence management system is the Brandle Presence Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberson|first1=Chip|url=http://www.brandle.net/blog/2013/11/social-presence-vs-social-content|title=Social Content vs. Social Presence - Don't neglect your social footprint|publisher=Brandle, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to publish content to the various points of web presence, multiple [[content management system]]s and sometimes even [[social media]] [[management system]]s are often used. The primary focus of most content and social media management systems is limited to their specific web platforms.

===Domain names===
Another aspect of web presence management is managing the collection of [[domain name]]s registered to the person or business. Any entity may register multiple domain names for the same property. As a result, they can link alternative spellings, different [[top-level domain]]s, aliases, brands, or products to the same website. Similarly, negative or derogatory domain names may also be registered. This is done to prevent certain domain names from being used against the person or business.

It is common for a larger business to have domain names registered by multiple employees at multiple [[domain name registrar]]s, possibly a result of organizational or geographical requirements. Consequently, a web presence management system can be used to monitor all domain names registered by the business, regardless of the registrars used.

==Discovery==
Web presence discovery is the process of monitoring the web for a new point of presence about a person or business. Web presence discovery is often included in a web presence management system. Whether a new domain is registered, a new website is published, or a new social media account is established, it occurs outside of the person’s or business’ control. As a result, its purpose is to assess a new point of presence and appropriately handle any violations.

It is important to note that web presence discovery differs from content listening. The former involves looking for new properties on the web, whereas the latter refers to analyzing content that already exists to hear how a person or business is seen often in near real time. Examples of content listening systems include [[Sysomos]] and Radian6, which is now a subsidiary of [[Salesforce.com]].

===Brand protection===
A person or business may choose to watch for a new web presence that might appear to misrepresent or mislead an audience, such as counterfeiters, spoofers, or malicious hackers. One of the early software in the online brand protection marketplace was [[MarkMonitor]], now part of [[Thomson Reuters]]. This software helped detect rogue domain names and websites.

However, the modern day growth of social media has seen a rise in the number of fraudulent brand impersonations. It has become much easier for a new web presence to be created on those platforms, which results in a greater frequency of them today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reputation@Risk - 2014 global survey on reputation risk|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Governance-Risk-Compliance/gx_grc_Reputation@Risk%20survey%20report.pdf|website=Deloitte|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Risk Management Survey 2015|url=http://www.aon.com/2015GlobalRisk/default.jsp|website=AON|publisher=AON|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="17th Annual Global CEO Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=17th Annual Global CEO Survey|url=http://read.pwc.com/i/243985-pwcs-17th-annual-global-ceo-survey|website=PwC|publisher=PwC|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/US/en/Issues/Governance-and-reporting/Audit-Committee/BoardMatters-Quarterly---April-2014---4---The-business-of-social-media |title=BoardMatters Quarterly, April 2014 - The business of social media - EY - United States |publisher=EY |date= |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Matters Quarterly - Critical insights for today’s audit committee|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_-_Board_Matters_Quarterly,_April_2014/$FILE/ey-BMQ-April-2014-Balancing-the-risks-and-rewards-of-digital-technology.pdf|publisher=Ernst &amp; Young LLP|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a preventative measure, online brand protection providers are now adding social media to their domain and website discovery options.

===Security===
The widespread growth of social media has also made it easier for unauthorized individuals to impersonate an employee. Consequently, social media has now become a recognized threat vector in that it can be used to [[Social engineering (security)|socially engineer]] an attack on a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinkley|first1=Chris|title=Social Media Makes Way for Social Engineering|url=http://www.securityweek.com/social-media-makes-way-social-engineering|website=SecurityWeek|publisher=Wired Business Media|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Tony|title=Think twice before you accept that 'friend' request|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/2137134/social-engineering/think-twice-before-you-accept-that--friend--request.html|website=CSO|publisher=CXO Media, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, companies are able to use web presence monitoring tools to detect new points of presence on the web and thereby defend against socially engineered attacks.&lt;ref name="17th Annual Global CEO Survey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=James|title=A CISO's Nightmare: Digital Social Engineering|url=http://www.securityweek.com/cisos-nightmare-digital-social-engineering|website=SecurityWeek|publisher=Wired Business Media|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security for social networking|url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/it-risk-security/assets/social-networking-final.pdf|website=PwC|publisher=PwC|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreesen|first1=Tom|last2=Slemp|first2=Cal|title=Managing Risk in a Social Media-Driven Society|url=http://www.protiviti.com/en-US/Documents/Insights/Managing-Risk-in-a-Social-Media-Driven-Society.pdf|website=Protiviti|publisher=Protiviti, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed inventory management===
A web presence monitoring system can be used by a business to associate a new web property with its corporate inventory. It is designed to address autonomous, distributed behaviors. This usually applies to larger businesses whose geographically diverse employees are more prone to creating new points of presence on the web. For example, a retail chain may allow each local store to create and manage their web presence to market to and communicate with their local customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberson|first1=Chip|title=Social Media for the Retail Industry - Going Local and Liking It!|url=http://www.brandle.net/blog/2013/10/social-media-retail-industry-going-local-liking|website=Brandle|publisher=Brandle, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a global business may have teams in each country or region who create and manage a web presence to adapt to local languages or cultures.

==Monitoring==
Web presence monitoring is the process of monitoring a known inventory of web presence to detect any changes that are made. Web presence monitoring is often included in a web presence management system and can serve multiple purposes for both larger corporations and certain individuals, such as celebrities.

It is important to note that presence monitoring differs from content listening. The former involves monitoring the properties (e.g. branding) of a web property in an established inventory, whereas the latter refers to analyzing content that already exists to hear how a person or business is seen often in near real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Survey of Bank Compliance Officers|url=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/073015BankComplianceOfficerSurvey.aspx|website=ABA|publisher=American Bankers Association|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, presence monitoring focuses on owned media and content listening on earned media.

===Corporate, brand, and regulatory compliance===
Many companies ensure that certain standards are met for a property on the web that represents their business. For companies in regulated industries, such as finance and healthcare, the company may be required by law to ensure that all publicized content, regardless of platform or technology, follow specific requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Media: Consumer Compliance Risk Management Guidance|url=https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2013/fil13056a.pdf|website=FDIC|publisher=FFIEC|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Media Compliance Isn’t Fun, But It’s Necessary|url=https://hbr.org/2012/08/social-media-compliance-isnt|website=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Notice 10-06|url=http://www.finra.org/file/regulatory-notice-10-06|website=FINRA|publisher=FINRA|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread growth of social media has seen a rise in the number of fraudulent corporate impersonations. It has become much easier for a new web presence to be created on these platforms, and so these are much more prevalent than they used to be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a preventative measure, a web presence monitoring system alerts the company when a known property is changed, allowing for the property to be reviewed and amended so that it follows the proper standards.
.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Church|first1=Janet|last2=Roberson|first2=Chip|title=Social Media Risks and Rewards|url=http://www.scotsmanguide.com/Residential/Articles/2014/06/Social-Media-Risks-and-Rewards/|website=Scotsman Guide|publisher=Scotsman Guide Media|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A web presence monitoring system helps alert the company when a known property is changed, so it can be reviewed and brought back, if necessary, into compliance with the appropriate standards.

==Audit==
A '''web presence audit''' is performed by an enterprise to determine that all [[Point of presence|points of presence]] on the web meet the objectives as well as [[governance, risk management, and compliance]] (GRC) needs. To ensure neutrality, these audits are often conducted as part of an [[information technology audit]] by a [[professional services]] agency or an internal audit team. However, a less formal web presence audit is often performed by internal members as a routine to meet GRC objectives.

A web presence audit usually includes web presence discovery and a review of all web-based content in the business’ inventory of web presence. Even though web presence monitoring is not performed in a web presence audit, a review of the nature and scope of the company's web presence monitoring policies, procedures, and tools is considered.

===Social media audit===
Due to the emerging challenges introduced by the dynamic nature of social media, a business may choose to perform specific '''social media audits''' in greater frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Juergens|first1 = Michael|title = Social Media Risks Create an Expanded Role for Internal Audit|url = http://deloitte.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/08/06/social-media-risks-create-an-expanded-role-for-internal-audit/|website = Wall Street Journal|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Dowie|first1 = Jon|title = EMERGING TECHNOLOGY RISKS - Social Media - Internal Audit’s response|url = https://www.kpmg.com/BE/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/Social%20Media_ITIA's%20response.pdf|website = KPMG|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social media audit is similar to a web presence audit, but may also include the purposes of maintaining an accurate inventory of all business social media points of presence. Alternatively, the business may choose to employ automated web presence discovery and compliance systems to keep the corporate social media inventory up-to-date and compliant with GRC needs.

==Web presence vs. web reputation management==
[[Reputation management|Reputation management systems]] are often associated with web presence management. Web presence management is knowing ''where'' an individual or business is represented, whereas [[reputation management]] is knowing ''what'' people are saying about an individual or business. Web presence management handles owned media, while reputation management systems with earned media.

Both systems offer some similar degree of remediation. For web presence management systems, remediation would include finding counterfeit properties that infringe on a brand or trademark. For reputation management systems, remediation would include identifying and eliminating misleading reviews and/or encouraging the contribution of authentic comments.

Even though a web presence monitoring tool can help identify unowned web properties where people are talking about a person, product, or brand, it is only part of the solution. A reputation management system often includes a content listening system to monitor the stream of messages about a particular subject which may be coming from any point of presence on the web (e.g. a comment about a product by a customer on her personal Twitter account). For examples of some [[:Category:Reputation management companies|reputation management companies, click here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2585">'''Workforce Investment Boards''' (or "WIBs") were regional entities created to implement the [[Workforce Investment Act of 1998]] in the [[United States]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of Palau]] and the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]]. The implementing law was replaced by the [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act]] in 2014.

Every community in the fifty states, the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and [[Republic of Palau]], was associated with a Local WIB (LWIB). For each LWIB, a chief elected official (for example, a county commissioner or the mayor of a lead city) appointed members to sit on the WIB.  These appointed positions were unpaid.  At least 50% of a WIB's membership was required to come from private businesses.  There were also designated seats for representatives from [[labor unions]] and educational institutions like [[community college]]s as well. Beyond these basic guidelines, many aspects of how an individual WIB operated could vary.

The WIB's main role was to direct [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Local government|local]] funding to [[workforce development]] programs. WIBs conducted and published research on these programs and the needs of their regional economy. They also oversaw the [[One-Stop Career Centers]], where job seekers could get employment information, find out about career development training opportunities and connect to various programs in their area. One-Stop Career Centers also provided many no-cost services to employers. Services varied by state and WIB.

WIBs worked in conjunction with economic development related organizations to minimize the reaction time and create resources to intervene for both the dislocated workforce and the incumbent workforce members of a community.
