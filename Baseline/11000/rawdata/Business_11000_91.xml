'''Air transport network''' or air transportation network (ATN) is an example of [[transport network]]s and [[spatial network]]s. The nodes of the network are the airports and the links represent direct flight routes between two airports.&lt;ref name="Bart"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barthelemy | first1 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Spatial Networks | arxiv = 1010.0302| journal = Physics Reports | volume = 499 | issue = 1–3| pages = 1–101 | doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2010.11.002| bibcode = 2011PhR...499....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, cities can be considered as the nodes with links representing direct flight connection between them. Air transport networks can be defined worldwide as well as for one region or for one airline company; the scale of the network can be global or domestic.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

==Properties of air transport networks==
The graph of an air transport network is spatial but not a  [[planar graph]]. The air transportation network is a [[complex network]] which has the properties of [[small-world networks]] and [[scale-free networks]].&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guimera | first1 = R. | last2 = Mossa | first2 = S. | last3 = Turtschi | first3 = A. | last4 = Amaral | first4 = L.

The [[Hub (network science)|hubs]] of the network have large connectivities and long-distance connectivities at the same time.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

An anomalous property of the air transport networks is that nodes with relatively low degrees may have very high [[betweenness centrality]]. It is an important observation related to the [[robustness of complex networks]]. According to this finding the critical points of the system are not necessarily the hubs, but some other cities which uniquely provides routes to certain regions.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lordan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lordan | first1 = O. | last2 = Sallan | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Simo | first3 = P. | last4 = Gonzales-Prieto | first4 = D. | year = 2014 | title = Robustness of the air transport network | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554514000805 | journal = Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 155–163 | doi=10.1016/j.tre.2014.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Alaska can be easily isolated from the other parts of the worldwide air transport network.&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;

The worldwide air transport network defines communities. These communities are mainly determined by geographical factors. However, in some cases the borders of the communities are different from the borders of geographic regions. Such an example is the community of Europe and Asian Russia.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

==Examples for air transport networks==
The worldwide air transportation network is represented by the database of [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA).&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrat"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrat | first1 = A. | last2 = Barthelemy | first2 = M. | last3 = Pastor-Satorras | first3 = R. | last4 = Vespignani | first4 = A. | year = 2004 | title = The architecture of complex weighted networks | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/11/3747.full | journal = Proc.

Sci. | volume = 101 | issue = 11| pages = 3747–3752 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0400087101 | pmid=15007165 | pmc=374315| arxiv = cond-mat/0311416 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.3747B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide air transportation network is a [[critical infrastructure]] with high impact on mobility, trade and economy.&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;

Another examples are the air transport systems of a country or a country's own air transport company. It is particularly important, because the quality of the airports and national airlines are also the measures of the state of development of the country.&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;

==Application of air transport networks==
Modeling air transport networks aims airline companies to organize their routes in a cost-efficient way and therefore maximize their profits. Air transport network models are also the tool to investigate system robustness. They help to determine weaknesses of the system in case of various kinds of disruptions.&lt;ref name="Lordan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;X. Hu and E. Di Paolo "A Genetic Algorithm Based on Complex Networks Theory for the Management
of Airline Route Networks", Studies in Computational Intelligence (SCI) 129, 495–505 (2008) (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.434.8417&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=495).&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative application is modeling [[human disease network]]s. Air transport network is used by millions of people every day, therefore it plays key role in the spread of some infections, such as influenza or [[SARS]]. In this sense air transport network is a transmitter similar to [[sexual network]]s, which is liable for the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Gui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gui2"/&gt;

'''Aircraft recycling''' is the [[recycling industry]] of [[aircraft]].

==Market==

Each year, 400 to 450 aircraft are scrapped and disassembled globally, for a $2 billion market for aircraft parts, and 12,500 aircraft will reach their end-of-life in the 20 years after 2009.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ATEMoct2009/&gt;--&gt;
Of those, around one third are parted out and disassembled by members of the [[Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association|AFRA]].&lt;ref name=ATEMoct2009&gt;{{cite article |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040613/https://afraassociation.org/NewsDocs/09_OctNov_ATE_M.pdf |title= Aircraft recycling best practice and the role of AFRA |magazine= Aircraft Technology Engineering &amp; Maintenance |date= October 2009 |pages= 30-37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The AFRA is an international non-profit association aiming to promote environmental [[best practice]]s, regulatory excellence and sustainable developments in the fields of aircraft disassembly, as well as the salvaging and recycling aircraft parts and materials.

Retirements peaked at more than 700 in 2013 and declined to about 500 in 2016 while strong demand and relatively low fuel prices keep older airliners flying, the in-service aircraft older than 15 years grew by more than 1,600 between 2013 and 2017.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;--&gt;
As part prices were high in early 2018, some young, 15–20 years old A319 and A320s are being parted out.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;--&gt;
Decommissions should rise to 750 annually, 3,900 from 2018 through 2022, while manufacturers plan to ramp up deliveries to 2,200 aircraft in 2020.&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-aircraft-retirement-wave-poses-challenges-446179/ |title= Aircraft retirement wave poses challenges for recyclers |date= 5 March 2018 |author= Michael Gubisch |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage statistics ==

Lessor [[Avolon]] count 2,100 aircraft are in storage in 2017 with 1,000 which shouldn't fly again: half are parked for more than three years and the other half is older than 25 years.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO6nov2017/&gt;--&gt;
A parked airplane may return to service if it's younger than 15 and aircraft parked over three years have a 50% chance of flying again, dropping to 20% for aircraft stored over five years.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO6nov2017/&gt;--&gt;
With owners accepting their assets value, this 2,100 should remain constant as the global jet transport fleet doubles to 51,800 over the next 20 years with 43,000 new deliveries and 16,000 retirements projected through 2037.&lt;ref name=MRO6nov2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/fleet/old-birds |title= Old Birds |at= Smarter end-of-life strategies will cut into storage figures, Avolon says. |author= Lee Ann Shay |date= Nov 6, 2017 |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:IL-86 RA-86095 Scissor cockpit. (3121102935).jpg|thumb|[[Ilyushin Il-86]] cut at [[Sheremetyevo Airport]]]]

Airliners are typically operated for 20 to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Aircraft Recycling |url = http://www.aviationpros.com/article/10874310/aircraft-recycling |date = 28 February 2013 |author= Charles Chandler |work= AviationPros |publisher= [[Cygnus Business Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Corrosion]], [[metal fatigue]], and low availability of new spare parts are problems encountered in greater frequency the older a machine becomes.
Eventually, these factors, alongside improvements in fuel-efficiency and reduction in maintenance cost of newer machines, reduce the economical viability of the operation of older airliners. 
Consequently, they may be stored, or scrapped and recycled.

&lt;!-- storage --&gt;
Vast expanses of arid desert are ideal for storage because hangars are not needed to maintain the aircraft at low humidity. Upon arrival, aircraft are washed to remove corroding salt, drained of fuel and lubricated with a light viscous oil. Explosive devices from the [[evacuation slide]]s are removed, air ducts sealed, and an easily removable protective coat of paint may be applied.&lt;ref name=BBC18sep2014&gt;{{Cite news |title = The secrets of the desert aircraft 'boneyards' |url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140918-secrets-of-the-aircraft-boneyards |publisher= BBC |author= Stephen Dowling| date = 18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some airliners are kept in working order as reserves, and a few are involved in fire-fighting and aerospace training schemes or in safety tests.&lt;ref name=BaselNov2006&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161018043030/http://www.grida.no/files/publications/vital-waste2/VWG2_p3to46.pdf |title= Vital Waste Graphics 2 |date= November 2006 |publisher= The Basel Convention Secretariat |author= Claudia Heberlein |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most are used as source of spare parts and scrapped.
The scrapping process takes six weeks and begins with the removal of the explosive escape equipment and toxic de-icing fluid.
Some components are unbolted and salvaged, including the engines and instruments, while the fuel is drained away.&lt;ref name=AvWeek1Feb2006&gt;{{Cite news |title= Recycling Aircraft |date= 1 Feb 2006 |work= Aviation Week |author= Bill Burchell |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120223114843/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=om&amp;id=news%2Fom206pam.xml &lt;!-- subscription required: http://aviationweek.com/awin/pamela-project--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seats are worth from $450 to $5,000 and the [[landing gear]] can be sold for millions of dollars, although all parts need a Certificate of Airworthiness to be re-used. Cables, batteries and other [[electronic waste]] are fed into the conventional recycling chains.
The remaining shell is cut into pieces and broken down by an [[industrial shredder]] so that the aluminium can be melted down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Where Old Airplanes Go to Die |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/business/28iht-wbscrap.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date= March 28, 2009 |issn= 0362-4331 |author= Caroline Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= How To Recycle An Airplane |url= http://jalopnik.com/5569874/how-to-recycle-an-airplane/ |author= Matt Hardigree |date= 22 June 2010 |website = [[Jalopnik]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= How do you recycle a jumbo jet? |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8542482.stm |publisher= BBC |date= 10 March 2010 |author= Mario Cacciottolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scrap metal is ground up, mechanically sorted by density and magnetism, then sold to the trade.
A future challenge for disposal is the construction of aircraft which use composite materials, such as aluminium/fibreglass [[GLARE]] in the [[Airbus A380]].&lt;ref name=BaselNov2006/&gt;
There are also concerns about contamination with alloys and the dumping of non-recyclable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~pgrant/Airplane%20scrapping%20and%20recycling.pdf |title= Aircraft Scrapping and Recycling |date= 28 Nov 2007 |publisher= Boeing Commercial Airplanes |work= Airplane Environmental Performance |author= Bill Carberry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N951AR McDonnell Douglas MD-11F Skylease Cargo (8754546592).jpg|thumb|[[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] part out]]

An airliner can be dismantled in 1,500-2,000 parts (1,000 or so [[Line-replaceable unit|LRU]]s) in 30–60 days including engines, landing gear, auxiliary power units and components but it can be parked a year or two to maximise the part harvesting.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;--&gt;
A metal aircraft can be recycled up to 85-90% by mass with a 95% goal, and 85-90% could be maintained for composite airframes as the industry adapts with a carbonfibre market growing 12-14% a year towards 100,000t in 2019 of which 50% could be satisfied with recycled material.&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;

== Places ==

The [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] in Arizona is home to 4,400 retired aircraft, chiefly military, and the [[Mojave Air and Space Port]] stores over 1000 civilian planes.&lt;ref name=BBC18sep2014/&gt;
Purpose-built recycling platforms may be used, such as those of Bartin Aero Recycling at [[Châteauroux-Centre "Marcel Dassault" Airport|Châteauroux-Déols airport]] in France, Air Salvage International at [[Cotswold Airport]], UK, and the Evergreen Aircenter, in Marana, US. [[Airbus]] has set up a centre in [[Tarbes–Lourdes–Pyrénées Airport|Tarbes Airport]] in France to research the decommission and recycling of older aircraft as part of the [[PAMELA Project]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek1Feb2006/&gt;

== History ==
SRC LLC, the predecessor to Alteryx, was founded in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding.&lt;ref name="SanFranBusinessTimesRoundOne"&gt;{{cite news|title=SAP Ventures invests $6M in Alteryx Inc.|first=Steven|last=Brown|newspaper=San Francisco Business Times|date=5 April 2011|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2011/04/05/sap-ventures-invests-6m-in-alteryx-inc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRC developed the first online data engine for delivering demographic-based mapping and reporting shortly after being founded.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"&gt;{{cite press release |title=SRC Corporate Overview |url= http://src.mediaroomshowcase.com/file.php/2441/SRC+backgrounder.pdf |accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, SRC released Allocate, a data engine incorporating geographically organized [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ExtendTheReach.Com / Products / SoloCast |url= http://www.extendthereach.com/products/allocate |archivedate=8 February 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208021200/http://www.extendthereach.com/products/allocate/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows users to manipulate, analyze and map data.&lt;ref name="OrangeCountyOCCensus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Census deal for O.C. firm |first=Jan |last=Norman |newspaper=The Orange County Register |date=17 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"/&gt;

In 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on [[CD-ROMs]] of [[United States Census|Census Data]] sold by the [[U.S. Census Bureau|Bureau]].&lt;ref name="OrangeCountyOCCensus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyCameraCensus"&gt;{{cite news|date=5 July 2001|newspaper=Daily Camera|title=SRC organizing census data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.&lt;ref name="SRCOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.&lt;ref name=10K2017/&gt;

In 2011, Alteryx raised $6 million in venture funding from the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] investment arm of [[SAP AG]], SAP Ventures.&lt;ref name="SanFranBusinessTimesRoundOne"/&gt; In 2013, Alteryx raised $12 million from SAP Ventures and [[Toba Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 May 2013|first=Chris|last=Casacchia|newspaper=Orange County Business Journal|title=Toba in $12M Round for Big Data Analytics Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=TechCrunch|title=Alteryx Raises $12M For Data Analytics Platform That Shapes Data Into Apps|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/819570/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the company raised $60 million in Round B funding&lt;ref name="FortuneRoundB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyCameraRoundB"/&gt; from [[Insight Venture Partners]], [[SAP AG|SAP Ventures]] and Toba Capital, and announced plans for a 30% workforce expansion.&lt;ref name="BizWest"/&gt;

In 2015, Iconiq Capital led a $85 million investment in Alteryx, with [[Insight Venture Partners]] and [[Meritech Capital Partners]] also participating. Alteryx announced plans to use the new capital to expand internationally, invest in research and development, and increase its sales and marketing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Iconiq Capital Leads $85 Million Investment in Alteryx|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/business/dealbook/iconiq-capital-leads-85-million-investment-in-alteryx.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-10-28|access-date = 2015-10-28|issn = 0362-4331|first = Leslie|last = Picker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Data firm Alteryx secures $85M investment, could make "unicorn" list|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/company-689558-alteryx-customers.html|newspaper = Orange County Register|date = 2015-10-28|first = Lauren|last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
In October 2017, it was discovered that Alteryx was subject to a data breach of partially anonymized data records for approximately 123 million U.S. households. While no names were attached, telephone numbers and physical addresses were among the 248 fields per household involved in the breach. Also included was "consumer demographics, life event, direct response, property, and mortgage information for more than 235 million consumers" according to the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/12/19/120m-american-households-exposed-in-massive-consumerview-database-leak/#6de7226f7961]&lt;/ref&gt; Alteryx assembled information from [[Experian]] and public sources like the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] to create their product which sold for {{dollarsign|US}}39,000 per license. Alteryx's hosting on [[Amazon Web Services]] had been unsecured (its sources had no breach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/12/22/experian-data-breach-alteryx-amazon-equifax/|title=Data Breach Exposes 123 Million U.S. Households|author=Hackett, Robert|date=December 22, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017|publisher=Fortune: Time, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ABS-5302.0-BalancePaymentsInternationalInvestmentPositionAustralia-BalancePaymentsSummary-Original Quarter-GoodsServices-A3533958L.svg|thumb|right|300px|The contribution of goods and services to Australia's current account (in $Millions) since 1959.]]
In trade terms, the [[Economy of Australia|Australian economy]] has had persistently large [[current account]] deficits for more than 50 years.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8931798 Downwonder] [[Economist.com]], 29 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One single factor that undermines [[balance of payments]] is Australia's narrow export base. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Dependent upon commodities, the Australian government has endeavoured to redevelop the [[manufacturing in Australia|Australian manufacturing sector]]. This initiative, also known as microeconomic reform, has helped Australian manufacturing to grow from 10.1% in 1983-1984 to 17.8% in 2003-2004.&lt;ref&gt;Leading Edge, R: "Australia in the Global Economy", ''Tim Dixon and John O'Mahomy'', page 133 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are other factors that have contributed to the extremely high current account deficit that Australia has today. Lack of international competitiveness and heavy reliance on capital goods from overseas might increase Australia's current account deficit in the future. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Low levels of national savings also contribute to high current account deficits. This is because excessive expenditure will force a lot of businesses to seek funds overseas. At the same time, when governments run constant budget deficits, they meet their monetary requirements by borrowing from the domestic sector. Economists refer to the ‘crowding out effect’ to explain this economic situation. When governments borrow from the domestic sector, they force the private sector to ‘crowd out’. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Since there aren't enough funds available within the domestic economy, the private sector is forced to borrow funds from overseas. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}
The borrowing of funds is simply typed into the borrowers account at interest to the lender and the fractional reserve banking system kicks in via computerised lendings. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Borrowing from overseas causes Australia’s current account deficit to increase, leading to a major increase in credit debt expansion. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with the debt growing if Gross Domestic Product grows at the same time. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} That is, current account deficit has to stay within a range of 4-5% in order to meet regular interest repayments on foreign debt whilst maintaining perpetual servitude of the borrower and interest repayments to the lender.

However, excessive current account deficit, combined with low investor confidence and the possibility of a [[currency crisis]], may force the central bank to implement contractionary macroeconomic policies to restrict economic growth. When economic growth or activity is being restricted, low investment and low levels of expenditure will generally restrain the current account from growing. Nevertheless, Australia’s current account deficit needs a long term solution in order to secure the Australian economy's viability. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Many economists {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}, notably John Pitchford, argued that choices whether to borrow or lend are dealt with between private or ‘consenting adults’ and in consequence no governmental intervention is necessary. There are also other experts who argue that Australia’s high current account deficit will undermine the Australian dollar and that it might experience a similar crisis experienced by the Thai currency that foreshadowed major economic crisis.

== Effects on wider economy ==
There are multiple complications that result if countries have a high sustained current account deficit and high foreign debt. While sustainable foreign debt is not a major problem, an unsustainable current account deficit can have serious repercussions for the Australian economy. In December 2007, Australia's deficit hit $23.3 billion which was an 18 per cent increase from three months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/record-deficit-blowout/2008/03/04/1204402456355.html Record deficit blow-out] 5 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2458">A '''banishment room''' (also known as a '''chasing-out-room''' and a '''boredom room''') is a modern [[employee exit management]] strategy whereby employees are transferred to another department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Ida|title=Japanese companies using ‘banishment rooms’ to push employees to resign|url=http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Japan Daily Press|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASAHI&gt;{{cite news|title=BANISHMENT ROOM: Top companies under investigation over unfair labor practices|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=THE ASAHI SHIMBUN|date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TABUCHI&gt;{{cite news|last=TABUCHI|first=HIROKO|title=Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethicality of the practice is questionable and may be construed as [[constructive dismissal]] in some regions.

The practice, which is not officially acknowledged, is common in [[Japan]] which has strong labor laws and a tradition of [[permanent employment]].

The '''British Chamber of Commerce in Mexico''' is an independent [[non-profit]] organisation that promotes trade between [[Mexico]] and the [[UK]]. The Chamber is a non-profit organisation and so independent of any government. The British Chamber of Commerce in Mexico is one of the European Chambers in Mexico with the highest membership rate; it is also one of the most active British Chambers in Latin America.

== History ==
The British Chamber of Commerce was founded in Mexico City on the 24th of June 1921 when a Charter was signed by the following individuals:

*Joseph H. Hogarth, who became the first Chairman of the Board
*Crosbie H. Lloyd, who acted as secretary for 7 years
*William Holden
*John S. Pattinson

Although the Charter was only signed in 1921, there had been meetings of British manufacturers and businessmen in Mexico beforehand, in the years leading up to the creation of the Chamber.

At the time of the Chamber's creation, British investment in Mexico was very high. In following years, this interest declined, but in more recent years, efforts to increase bilateral trade have met with success.

== Services ==
The British Chamber of Commerce in Mexico hosts its own events, helps organize and participates in external events, obtains discounts for its members, offers advice and facilitates networking for businesses in Mexico or companies interested in establishing themselves in Mexico.

== Business sector groups ==
Chamber members can join the Business Sector Groups, which represent certain industries in Mexico. They meet monthly to share advice and best practices as well as organise events related to their sector and write reports.

'''Cover''' is a term used in the [[law]] of [[contracts]] to describe a remedy available to a buyer who has received an [[anticipatory repudiation]] of a contract for the receipt of goods. Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], the buyer is permitted (but not required) to find another source of the same type of goods. The buyer may then file a [[lawsuit]] against the breaching seller to recover the difference, if any, between the cost of the goods offered and the cost of the goods actually purchased.

The possibility of cover will prevent a party from being able to sue for [[specific performance]], which is an equitable remedy that requires the buyer have no adequate remedy at law. If the buyer is able to buy elsewhere and sue for the difference, that provides an adequate remedy. This prohibition does not apply, however, to the sale of unique goods such as original works of art, collectibles, [[real estate]], and [[exclusive right]]s.

Judge [[Richard Posner]] has suggested that the availability of cover allows for [[efficient breach]] - that is, that it encourages the most efficient allocation of resources by allowing a seller to breach a contract to sell goods to one buyer when another, more lucrative opportunity comes along. The seller may thus be able to realize a sufficiently increased profit to make more money even after repaying the difference to the original buyer. Therefore, no value is lost in the transaction because the original buyer is in the same position he would have been in but for the breach, and the seller is in a better position.

'''Direct store delivery''' (DSD) is a key method of selling and distributing products for a large variety of industries, such as [[food]], [[beverage]], home [[personal care]] products, and [[wholesale]] and distribution, [[oil]] &amp; [[gas]], service industries to name industries beyond consumer products.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/DSD_Final_111108.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

DSD is a business process that manufacturers use to both sell and distribute goods directly to [[point of sale]]s (PoS) or point of consumption (PoC) including additional product and market related services such as [[merchandising]], [[information gathering]], or equipment service and bypassing any [[retailer]] or wholesaler logistics. A company that performs DSD does not send goods to any locations using any independent third party actor – neither an independent wholesaler, nor the retailer‘s own warehouses.

DSD is an alternative distribution model to centralized distribution and tends to be used extensively in the food industry for fresh products such as milk and bread where minimizing the number of days in the supply chain is a key concern.  Similarly, DSD is used effectively for full truckload orders where bypassing distribution centers makes economic sense.  DSD is also a favored approach when there is a strong requirement for supplier knowledge or service such as is the case with greeting cards for example.  Having said this, there is pressure building up in the food supply chain to reduce the retailer's reliance on DSD and push more volume through centralized distribution channels.

The [[Standard Interchange Language]] (SIL) acts as an interface standard for transferring data between proprietary store systems like DSD and PoS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17459">'''Econodynamics''' is an [[empirical science]] that studies emergences, motion and disappearance of [[Value (economics)|value]]—a specific concept that is used for description of the processes of production and distribution of [[wealth]]. Econodynamics is based on the achievements of classical [[political economy]]  and neo-classical [[economics]] and has been using the methods of phenomenological science to investigate evolution of [[economic system]]. Econodynamics has been proposing  methods of analysis and forecasting of [[econimic processes]].  The comprehensive review of the problems of econodynamics is given recently by [[Vladimir Pokrovskii]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production. The 3rd Ed. |last = Pokrovskii|first = Vladimir| publisher = Springer, Dordrecht-Heidelberg-London-New York.|year = 2018|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319720739 |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The Fundamentals==
===Concept of value===
Economic events are considered as processes of creation, motion and distribution of [[value (economics)|value]] that is understood as [[exchange value]] without any factor interpretation. The factor theory of the exchange value is based on the Smith-Marx’s  [[labour theory of value]]. according to which efforts of workers &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;    are the most  essential production factor. It was impossible to explain the modern [[economic growth]] without introduction the second value-creating factor, closely connected with production equipment. The neoclassical [[economics]] has delabourated the ideas about productive force of capital  and is using the value of production equipment &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; as a characteristic variable.&lt;ref name=cobb&gt;Cobb, G.W. and  Douglas, P.N. (1928). "A Theory of Production." American Economic Review, Suppl. (March), pp. 139-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sollow&gt;Solow, R. (1957). "Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function." Review of Economic Studies, vol. 39 (Aug.), pp. 312-330.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to it, econodynamics  has been taking into account the functional role of production equipment, as  a set of appliances that allow to substitute efforts of workers with work of outer sources of power. A new concept of substitutive work &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; was introduced, to  characterize the functional role of machinery in production processes.  The law of substitution, which is  one of the main principles of econodynamics,  generalized the Smith-Marx’s  [[labour theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Energy and organization: Growth and distribution reexamined.| last1 = Beaudreau | first1 = B.C.  | publisher = Greenwood Press|year =1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=| last = Pokrovskii| first = V.N. | year = 2008| title = ) An extension of the labour theory of value | url = http://ecodynamics.narod.ru/value/value.pdf | journal = Pluralist Economics Review | volume = | issue = February|bibcode = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beaudreau, B.C. &amp; Pokrovski, V.N. (2010) On the energy content of a money unit.  Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 389 (13), 2597–2606.&lt;/ref&gt; and  provide a new interpretation of neo-classical economics. The variable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true  work of production equipment and is equivalent to workers’ efforts in entire relationship, so that the production of value &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a function of the two production factors
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Y = Y(L, P)                 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The extension of  the labour theory of value  with the  law of substitution  allows us to formulate the theory,&lt;ref name=article&gt;Pokrovski, V.N. (2003).  "Energy in the theory of production." Energy 28, 769-788.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production.|last = Pokrovskii|first = Vladimir| publisher = Springer, Dordrecht-Heidelberg-London-New York.|year = 2011|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-94-007-2095-4|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in fact, is a modification and re-interpretation of neo-classical theory of production with two production factors: labour &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and capital &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. The comparison of the theory with neo-classical theory  [[growth accounting]] that introduce the technical progress as the exogenous factor &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; gives  the expression  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
A(t) = \, \left(\frac{K_0}{K} \frac{P}{P_0}\right)^\alpha, \quad 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
The exogenous neo-classical technical progress &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; appears to be connected with the ratio of substitutive work to stock of capital &lt;math&gt;P/K&lt;/math&gt;, which can be considered as a  measure of technological progress itself, independent on the assumption made in the neo-classical theory. Sometimes it is convenient to use the non-dimensional  ratio of substitutive work to labour efforts &lt;math&gt;P/L&lt;/math&gt; as a characteristic  of technological progress; this quantity can be interpreted as the number of 'mechanical workers', operating in the production processes, in line with an 'alive worker'.  To the end  of the last century, this ratio reaches, for example, 12 for the USA&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;. Technical progress, as an internal property of the theory, is understood as a progress in substitution of labour with work of production equipment in technological processes.

The introduction  of the substitutive work &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;  could be useful, if one can measure  the  quantity. Although one can easily find estimates of the total amount of primary energy carriers, the biggest interest for our aims is caused by possible assessments of the quantity of energy going to the substitution of workers' efforts in processes of the production.  This is a problem, which has been considered specially.&lt;ref&gt;Pokrovski, V.N. (2007) Productive energy in the US economy, Energy 32 (5) 816-822.&lt;/ref&gt; The direct methods of estimation of the substitutive work can be used for both past and future situations. For example, the total  amount of substitutive work  in the U.S. economy in 1999 can be estimated as &lt;math&gt;10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; J per year. It is approximately one hundred times less than  total (primary) consumption of energy, which was about &lt;math&gt;97\cdot10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; J in 1999. However, the amount of primary energy (energy carriers), which is needed to provide this amount of substitutive work, is about &lt;math&gt;25\cdot 10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; J. It is about 26% of total primary consumption of energy.

===Value, Utility and Entropy===
Econodynamics establishes  relationship between the concreate wealth and abstract concepts of [[value (economics)|value]], [[utility]] and [[entropy]]. The artificial products created by humans: buildings, machines, vehicles, sanitation, clothes, home appliances and so on, can be sorted and counted, so that one consider the amounts of quantities  in  natural units of measurement &lt;math&gt; Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n&lt;/math&gt;  and the prices of all products &lt;math&gt; p_1, p_2,..., p_n&lt;/math&gt;  to be given, so that one can define increase in value  of a stock of products  as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
dW =  \sum_{j=1}^np_j \, dQ_j.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

Due to dependence of prices on the amounts of products &lt;math&gt; p_i = p_i (Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_n) &lt;/math&gt;,  one can hardly expect that form (4) is a total differential of any  function. In other words, one cannot say that &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic of the set of the products which is independent of the history of their creation. However, a function of a state, which is called [[utility function]], can be introduced on the basis of relation (4). Indeed, the linear form (4)  can be multiplied by  a certain function, which is called integration factor &lt;math&gt;\phi = \phi ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n)&lt;/math&gt;,  so that, instead of form (4), one  has a total differential of a new function 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
dU =  \sum_{j=1}^n \phi ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n) \, p_j ( Q_1, Q_2,..., Q_n) \, dQ_j.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}	The introduced function &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; is called [[utility]] function (objective), taking into account that the properties of function &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; coincide with those of the conventional [[utility]] function, which is introduced as {subjective} utility function connected with sensation of preference of one aggregate of products as against another. The above transformation of value to  utility reminds us transformation of heat to [[entropy]] in thermodynamics. In other terms, analogy between theory of utility and theory of heat  was discussed by von Neumann and Morgenstern &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=John von Neumann |last=Neumann |first=John von |authorlink2=Oskar Morgenstern |last2=Morgenstern |first2=Oskar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see item 3.2.1 of their work).

The artificial  products can be considered, as it was explained by Prigogine with collaborators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title =  From being to becoming: Time and complexity in the physical sciences.| last1 = Prigogine | first1 = I.  | publisher = Freeman &amp; Company|year =1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Self-organisation in non-equilibrium systems: From dissipative structures to order through fluctuations.|last1 = Nicolis | first1 = G.  | last2 = Prigogine | first2 = I.  | publisher = John Wiley \&amp; Sons|year =1977|isbn = |location =New York |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the far-from-equilibrium objects (the dissipative structures), and to create and maintain them,    the fluxes of matter and energy  are necessary to run  through the system. In our case, energy comes in the form of human efforts &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and work of external sources &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that can be used by means of the appropriate equipment. The creation of dissipative structures leads to decrease in entropy, and utility &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a close relation to entropy &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, though does not coincides with it. Considering that changes of internal energy in production of things can be neglected, one can write a thermodynamic relation 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
dU \approx - dS =  \frac{1}{T} (L+P).
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
Reconciliation of the two points of view on the phenomenon of  production  leads to a unified picture  that enables us to relate some aspects of our observations of economic phenomena to physical principles. A flux of information and work eventually determines new organisation of matter, which acquires forms of different commodities (complexity), whereby the production process is considered as a process of materialisation of information. The cost of materialisation of information is work of production system. To maintain complexity in a thermodynamic system, fluxes of matter and energy must flow through the system.



==Dynamics of development==

===Equations of evolution===
{{details|topic=|Technological theory of social production}}
To formulate the system of evolution equations of  the production system, function (1)  ought to be specified and dynamic equations for production factors &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;  to be formulated, while nessasery technological characteristics of production equipment to be introduced. In result, it came to the set of equations of [[economic growth]] -- the theory of evolution,  dubbed as the [[technological theory of social production]]. The theory is formulated  both in one-sector, and, using the [[Wassily Leontief]]'s [[input-output model]],   in multi-sector approximations. The data for the U.S. economy in the last century was used to justify the specification of the theory. It was demonstrated that the  substitution of worker's efforts  with work of the production equipment appears to be more adequate idea than the substitution of worker's efforts  with the amount of production equipment (capital in the neo-classical theory of economic growth);  work can be replaced onky with work, not with capital.  The theory demonstrates that the growth of production  is caused by achievements in technological consumption of labour and energy. The set of  equations determines three modes of economic development, depending on deficit of one of the factors: investment, labour or substitutive work.&lt;ref&gt;Pokrovskii, V.N. (2011)   Pulsation of the growth rate of output and technology.  Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Vol. 390  (23-24),  4347-4354.&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of modes during the development reveals as short cycles in growth—the busyness cycles.

===Applications===

The theory can be applied to any  national economy; principles of consistent analysis and forecast are considered.  As an example, dynamics of Russian economy for  years 1960 - 2060  is considered in one-sector and three-sector approximations(see&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Chapter 8 and 9). The elementary, three-branch model is used (see&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. Section 2.2.2, Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 and Section 9.5 in Chapter 9) for the description of dynamics of production (the expanded reproduction, in Marx's terms).

The theory allows, being based on the [[Angus Maddison]]"s estimates of the [[Gross World Product]] and [[World population]], to restore the picture of development of mankind in the previous centuries. It was shown (see &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;, Chapter 12). that one need the theory, based on the effect of substitution of worker's efforts with work of external power (two-factor theory), for the description of  the  evolution of production activity  from approximately year 1000 of our era. Before this time the substitution of human’s efforts for outer work  practically was not noticeable, and one can use one-factor theory that is taking into  account only one production factor -- efforts of workers. The theory is stated (see&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. section 1.3.1, the formula 1.1 in chapter 1 and section 12.3 in chapter 12).

===The principle of evolution===

One can see on raw of examples  that the production system, indeed, tries to swallow all available resources.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; This sentence can be considered as the principle of development of the production system and the human population itself, that has been developing as a self-organising system, trying to catch as much energy as possible. The human population, as    any biological population obeys  energy principle of evolution, which states that  those populations and their associations (ecosystems) which can use the greater amount of energy from their environment have an advantage for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lotka, A.J.  Elements of Physical Biology, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. Environmental Accounting. Energy and Environmental Decision Making, John Wiley \&amp; Sons, New York {\it etc}, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of energy is used by a human population through improvements of technology, and the managing huge amount of energy allows the human population to survive in every climate zone of the Earth and expand itself in great measure. The enlargement of the human population from a very small group a million years ago till about 7 billion in year 2012 ought to be apparently connected with enhancement of the living conditions. Apparently, it is impossible to explain growth of number of human population, not referring on social production system—the means  of adopting the human to conditions of existence.&lt;ref name=book&gt;V.N. Pokrovski, Physical Principles in the Theory of Economic Growth, Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, 1999. A revised and extended version of the monograph is published by Springer (2011) as [https://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-94-007-2095-4 ''Econodynamics. The Theory of Social Production''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The absolute measure of value==
Production of value (for year, for example) &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;  is a money  estimate  of 'useful' changes in our environment (in the form of useful consumer goods and services), which can be connected with production factors. In the Smith-Marx's theory of value, it is postulated that estimate of the efforts of workers &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is  an ultimate  source of all created wealth (products), an absolute measure of value. When one accounts the effect of substitution  of workers' efforts with the true work of the production equipment, one could expect, that the total amount of work  on the production of value, which is the sum of properly accounted work of humans &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and work of production equipment (substitutive work) &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, both measured in power units, could be an absolute measure of value, and one can write  
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Y \sim P + L
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
This relation allows one to estimate  the work needed for creation of wealth worth of one monetary units (energy content of monetary unit), which was done  for different cases&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;. For example, the mean value of 'energy content' of dollar  of year 1996 in  years 1960 - 2000 is &lt;math&gt;1.4\times 10^5&lt;/math&gt;   J.  The values of the 'energy content' of monetary units that are used for accounting  change during the time, which shows that the used units of money do not present constant amounts of 'true' value. The absolute  measure of value can be  introduced as some amount of energy.

{{Business administration}}

'''Online Business''' or '''e-business''' is any kind of business or commercial transaction that includes sharing information across the internet. [[Commerce]] constitutes the exchange of products and services between businesses, groups and individuals and can be seen as one of the essential activities of any business. Electronic commerce focuses on the use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] to enable the external activities and relationships of the business with individuals, groups and other businesses, while e-business refers to business with help of the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2004). E-Business. Palgrave, Basingstoke. {{ISBN|1-4039-1348-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "e-business" was coined by [[IBM]]'s marketing and Internet team in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstner, L. (2002). ''Who says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround.'' pg 172. {{ISBN|0-06-052379-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The e-business (r)evolution |last=Amor |first=D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River |ISBN= |page= |pages= |URL= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, IBM, with its agency [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], began to use its foundation in IT solutions and expertise to market itself as a leader of conducting business on the Internet through the term "e-business."&lt;ref name = Pettit&gt;{{cite book |title = Learning From Winners: How the ARF Ogilvy Award Winners Use Market Research to Create Advertising Success | first = Raymond | last = Pettit | year = 2012 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | ISBN = 9781136676765 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cmvmTgt93vcC&amp;pg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 32–33 |accessdate = 2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then CEO [[Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.]] was prepared to invest $1 billion to market this new brand.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A2d0RXhp4Q0C&amp;pg=PA30 |title = The Fast Path to Corporate Growth: Leveraging Knowledge and Technologies to New Market Applimcations | page = 30 | first=Marc H. | last = Meyer | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | ISBN=978-0195180862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After conducting worldwide market research in October 1997, IBM began with an eight-page piece in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that would introduce the concept of "e-business" and advertise IBM's expertise in the new field.&lt;ref name = Pettit/&gt; IBM decided ''not'' to trademark the term "e-business" in the hopes that other companies would use the term and create an entire new industry.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; However, this proved to be too successful and by 2000, to differentiate itself, IBM launched a $300 million campaign about its "e-business infrastructure" capabilities.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; Since that time, the terms, "e-business" and "e-commerce" have been loosely interchangeable and have become a part of the common vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowry|first1=Paul Benjamin|last2=Cherrington|first2=J. Owen|last3=Watson|first3=R. J.|title=E-Business Handbook|date=2001|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
{{Main|Business model}}

When organizations go online, they have to decide which e-business models best suit their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Timers, (2000), Electronic Commerce - strategies &amp; models for business-to-business trading, pp.31, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, {{ISBN|0-471-72029-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[business model]] is defined as the organization of product, [[Service (economics)|service]] and information flows, and the source of revenues and benefits for [[suppliers]] and [[customers]]. The concept of e-business model is the same but used in the online presence.

=== Revenue model ===
{{Main|Revenue model}}

A key component of the business model is the [[revenue model or profit model]], which is a framework for generating revenues. It identifies which revenue source to pursue, what value to offer, how to price the value, and who pays for the value. It is a key component of a company's business model. It primarily identifies what product or service will be created in order to generate revenues and the ways in which the product or service will be sold.

Without a well defined revenue model, that is, a clear plan of how to generate revenues, new businesses will more likely struggle due to costs which they will not be able to sustain. By having a clear revenue model, a business can focus on a target audience, fund development plans for a product or service, establish marketing plans, begin a line of credit and raise capital.

==== E-commerce ====
{{Main|E-commerce}}

E-commerce (short for "electronic commerce") is trading in products or services using computer networks, such as the Internet. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle, although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.

==Concerns==
While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the internet such as maps and [[Location awareness|location-aware service]]s may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World  | work=The Atlantic | url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/  | author=Badger, Emily |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge "‘Free Shipping Day’ Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago"] ''Comscore'', December 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ "The Death of the American Shopping Mall"] ''The Atlantic — Cities'', December 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Andrew Keen]], a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has recently focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses, since these businesses employ much fewer people per dollar of sales than traditional retailers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Security===
E-business systems naturally have greater [[network security|security]] risks than traditional business systems, therefore it is important for e-business systems to be fully protected against these risks. A far greater number of people have access to e-businesses through the internet than would have access to a traditional business. Customers, suppliers, employees, and numerous other people use any particular e-business system daily and expect their confidential information to stay secure. Hackers are one of the great threats to the security of e-businesses. Some common security concerns for e-Businesses include keeping business and customer information private and confidential, authenticity of data, and [[data integrity]]. Some of the methods of protecting e-business security and keeping information secure include physical security measures as well as data storage, data transmission, [[anti-virus software]], [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]s, and [[encryption]] to list a few.&lt;ref name="Pitts"&gt;University of Pittsburgh, comp. e-Business Resource Group Security Guidelines. Publication. 5 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;Industry Canada| Industrie Canada. Industry Canada, 24 Aug. 2010. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/dir-ect.nsf/eng/h_uw00348.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy and confidentiality====
[[Confidentiality]] is the extent to which businesses makes personal information available to other businesses and individuals.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;Westfall, Joseph."Privacy: Electronic Information and the Individual." Santa Clara University. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, 2010. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/submitted/westfall/privacy.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; With any business, confidential information must remain secure and only be accessible to the intended recipient. However, this becomes even more difficult when dealing with e-businesses specifically. To keep such information secure means protecting any electronic records and files from unauthorized access, as well as ensuring safe transmission and data storage of such information. Tools such as encryption and firewalls manage this specific concern within e-business.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Authenticity====
E-business transactions pose greater challenges for establishing authenticity due to the ease with which electronic information may be altered and copied. Both parties in an e-business transaction want to have the assurance that the other party is who they claim to be, especially when a customer places an order and then submits a payment electronically. One common way to ensure this is to limit access to a network or trusted parties by using a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) technology. The establishment of authenticity is even greater when a combination of techniques are used, and such techniques involve checking "something you know" (i.e. password or PIN), "something you need" (i.e. credit card), or "something you are" (i.e. [[digital signature]]s or [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]] methods). Many times in e-business, however, "something you are" is pretty strongly verified by checking the purchaser's "something you have" (i.e. credit card) and "something you know" (i.e. card number).&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

====Data integrity====
Data integrity answers the question "Can the information be changed or corrupted in any way?" This leads to the assurance that the message received is identical to the message sent. A business needs to be confident that data is not changed in transit, whether deliberately or by accident. To help with data integrity, firewalls protect stored data against unauthorized access, while simply backing up data allows recovery should the data or equipment be damaged.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Non-repudiation====
This concern deals with the existence of proof in a transaction. A business must have assurance that the receiving party or purchaser cannot deny that a transaction has occurred, and this means having sufficient evidence to prove the transaction. One way to address [[non-repudiation]] is using digital signatures.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; A digital signature not only ensures that a message or document has been electronically signed by the person, but since a digital signature can only be created by one person, it also ensures that this person cannot later deny that they provided their  signature.&lt;ref name="non"&gt;"What Is Nonrepudiation? - Definition." Information Security: Covering Today's Security Topics. TechTarget, 4 Sept. 2008. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci761640,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access control====
When certain electronic resources and information is limited to only a few authorized individuals, a business and its customers must have the assurance that no one else can access the systems or information. There are a variety of techniques to address this concern including firewalls, access privileges, user identification and authentication techniques (such as passwords and digital certificates), [[Virtual Private Network]]s (VPN), and much more.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Availability====
This concern is specifically pertinent to a business' customers as certain information must be available when customers need it. Messages must be delivered in a reliable and timely fashion, and information must be stored and retrieved as required. Because availability of service is important for all e-business websites, steps must be taken to prevent disruption of service by events such as power outages and damage to physical infrastructure. Examples to address this include data backup, fire-suppression systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) systems, virus protection, as well as making sure that there is sufficient capacity to handle the demands posed by heavy network traffic.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Cost====
The business internet which supports e-business has a cost to maintain of about $2 trillion in outsourced IT dollars just in the United States alone.  With each website custom crafted and maintained in code, the maintenance burden is enormous.  In the twenty-first century, look for new businesses that will help standardize the look and feel of the internet presence of a business to be more uniform in nature to help reduce the cost of maintenance.

===Security solutions===

When it comes to security solutions, sustainable electronic business requires support for data integrity, [[strong authentication]], and [[privacy]].

====Access and data integrity====
There are several different ways to prevent access to the data that is kept online. One way is to use anti-virus software. This is something that most people use to protect their networks regardless of the data they have. '''E-businesses''' should use this because they can then be sure that the information sent and received to their system is clean.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;
A second way to protect the data is to use firewalls and network protection. A firewall is used to restrict access to private networks, as well as public networks that a company may use. The firewall also has the ability to log attempts into the network and provide warnings as it is happening. They are very beneficial to keep third-parties out of the network. Businesses that use Wi-Fi need to consider different forms of protection because these networks are easier for someone to access. They should look into protected access, virtual private networks, or internet protocol security.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;
Another option they have is an intrusion detection system. This system alerts when there are possible intrusions. Some companies set up traps or "hot spots" to attract people and are then able to know when someone is trying to hack into that area.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Encryption====
[[Encryption]], which is actually a part of cryptography, involves transforming texts or messages into a code which is unreadable. These messages have to be decrypted in order to be understandable or usable for someone. There is a key that identifies the data to a certain person or company. With public key encryption, there are actually two keys used. One is public and one is private. The public one is used for encryption, and the private for decryption. The level of the actual encryption can be adjusted and should be based on the information. The key can be just a simple slide of letters or a completely random mix-up of letters. This is relatively easy to implement because there is software that a company can purchase. A company needs to be sure that their keys are registered with a certificate authority.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Digital certificates====
The point of a [[digital certificate]] is to identify the owner of a document. This way the receiver knows that it is an authentic document. Companies can use these certificates in several different ways. They can be used as a replacement for user names and passwords. Each employee can be given these to access the documents that they need from wherever they are.
These certificates also use encryption. They are a little more complicated than normal encryption however. They actually used important information within the code. They do this in order to assure authenticity of the documents as well as confidentiality and data integrity which always accompany encryption.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;
Digital certificates are not commonly used because they are confusing for people to implement. There can be complications when using different browsers, which means they need to use multiple certificates. The process is being adjusted so that it is easier to use.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Digital signatures====
A final way to secure information online would be to use a [[digital signature]]. If a document has a digital signature on it, no one else is able to edit the information without being detected. That way if it is edited, it may be adjusted for reliability after the fact. In order to use a digital signature, one must use a combination of cryptography and a message digest. A message digest is used to give the document a unique value. That value is then encrypted with the sender's private key.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

'''Emilio Estefan Gómez''' (born March 4, 1953) is a Cuban-American musician and producer of Lebanese heritage. Emilio has won 19 Grammy Awards. Estefan first came to prominence as a member of the [[Miami Sound Machine]]. He is the husband of singer [[Gloria Estefan]], father of son Nayib Estefan and daughter [[Emily Estefan]], and the uncle of Spanish-language television personality [[Lili Estefan]].

==Background==
Emilio Estefan Gómez was born on March 4, 1953 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba to Emilio Estefan, Sr. (c. 1920–2003)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/people-news/emilio-estefan-sr-1117883638/|title=Emilio Estefan Sr.|last=Staff|first=Variety|date=March 26, 2003|work=Variety|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carmen Maria Gómez (1921–2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F0LAAAAYAAJ&amp;q|title=Who's who in Florida's Latin Community: Biographical Dictionary of the Hispanics in Florida|date=1986|publisher=Worldwide Reference Publications|isbn=9780921261001|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmen's parents Antonio Gómez and Carmen Vasquez were Spanish immigrants who met while the latter was working for the [[Bacardi]] family. Cuban-born Emilio Sr. was the second-to last child in his family (which consisted of eleven siblings), and he had Lebanese ancestry from his paternal side—many of whom were textile traders that traveled throughout Cuba and the Caribbean. Emilio Sr. was raised by his widowed mother Julia, as his father had died when he was still a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKdtdvvoAukC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=The Rhythm of Success: How an Immigrant Produced his Own American Dream|last=Estefan|first=Emilio|date=January 5, 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101159750|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967, at the age of fourteen, Estefan and his father Emilio Sr. fled Cuba for Spain due to the [[Cuban Revolution]]. The Estefan family planned to reunite in the United States and, as a result, Carmen chose to remain behind because she did not want to abandon her parents. In addition, Estefan's older brother José (b. 1945) was drafted in the military and could not leave Cuba until 1980.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For about a year, Estefan and his father lived an impoverished life in Spain before relocating permanently in Miami, Florida. Although circumstances were far better in Miami, Estefan and Emilio Sr. still struggled as they lived in a cramped house with Estefan's aunt and 8 cousins.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/music/info-08-2013/gloria-emilio-estefan-aarp-magazine-story.html|title=Latin Pop Icon Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan, Multilingual CD The ...|last=Nash|first=Alanna|work=AARP|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estefan did not reunite with his mother until 1971 when she was finally able to immigrate to the United States. 

It was during his formative years that Estefan cultivated his musical sensibilities, as he had often used his accordion-playing skills to earn enough tips to support his father and family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-and-emilio-estefan-build-a-music-empire-and-a-family-compound-1448988567|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan Build a Music Empire and a Family Compound|date=December 1, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

=== Early music ===
{{further|Miami Sound Machine|Gloria Estefan}}
In 1975, Gloria and her cousin Mercedes "Merci" Navarro (1957–2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.obituaries/NoP1roy_xFA/TXIR2gsE7hcJ|title=Mercedes Navarro Murciano, 50, original member of Miami Sound Machine dead|last=|first=|date=|website=groups.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; met Estefan while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Estefan, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at Hotel Dupont, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band's name changing to [[Miami Sound Machine]]. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-and-emilio-estefan-build-a-music-empire-and-a-family-compound-1448988567|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan Build a Music Empire and a Family Compound|date=December 1, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, [[Miami Sound Machine]] would perform with Gloria Estefan (née Fajardo) as the lead singer and headliner.

=== Producer ===
As a producer, Estefan has shaped the careers of several music superstars. He has also produced various events for both general market and Hispanic market television. These events include the [[Latin Grammys]], Hispanic Heritage Awards, Nuestra Navidad, and some high-profile productions on HBO and Showtime. He has also produced many musical events at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/emilio-estefan-20th-television-latino-drama-series-361830|title=Emilio Estefan to Develop Latino-Themed Drama Series Under New Pact With 20th TV|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=October 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Estefan produced and directed his first full-length documentary ''90 Millas'' to showcase the history and pioneers of Cuban music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emilioestefanjr.com/director|title=Emilio Estefan – Director|last=FCab|first=Estefan Enterprises|website=Emilio Estefan|language=en|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estefan gathered dozens of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] entertainers in 2010 to record [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[We Are The World]]" in Spanish. The [[Spanish language]] version, already written by Estefan and approved by [[Quincy Jones]], became "[[Somos El Mundo]]". It premiered during ''[[El Show de Cristina#El Show de Cristina|El Show de Cristina]]'' on March 1, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/959197/somos-el-mundo-video-premieres-stars-pitbull-shakira-juanes|title='Somos El Mundo' Video Premieres, Stars Pitbull, Shakira, Juanes, David Archuleta, Daddy Yankee – Viral Videos|author=|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the funds went to the [[Humanitarian response by non-governmental organizations to the 2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesilvertongueonline.com/?p=9635t|title=Latino Celebrities Join Together for "Somos El Mundo" Recording|author=|date=February 20, 2010|publisher=Thesilvertongueonline.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222013634/http://thesilvertongueonline.com/?p=9635t|archive-date=February 22, 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959303/50-latin-stars-gather-to-record-somos-el-mundo|title=50 Latin Stars Gather To Record 'Somos El Mundo'|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 2010, Estefan released his book ''The Rhythm of Success – How an Immigrant Produced his own American Dream.'' The following year, Estefan presented the book ''The Exile Experience: A Journey to Freedom'' in collaboration with writer [[Carlos Pintado]] and journalist [[Carlos Alberto Montaner]], which included the personal testimonials from different generations of exiles.

''The Exile Experience: Journey to Freedom'' is published in three separate editions – each tailor-made for those who arrived through Operation Pedro Pan, the Freedom Flights and the Mariel boatlift. Each edition features the names of every Cuban who arrived via one of those three exoduses, and there has been an accumulation of 400,000 and more names amongst the three editions published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.booksandbooks.com/emilio_estefan_exile_experience|title=Emilio Estefan – The Exile Experience – Gables {{!}} Books &amp; Books|website=shop.booksandbooks.com|language=en|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He partnered with the Nederlander Group in 2013 to produce the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical extravaganza, ''[[On Your Feet!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/177119/gloria-and-emilio-estefans-on-your-feet-sets-broadway-dates-theater/|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan's on Your Feet! Sets Broadway Dates &amp; Theater|work=Broadway.com|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical is based on the life and musical legacy of the Estefans and Fajardos. ''On Your Feet!'' premiered on Broadway in October 2015.

Estefan also became an [[AARP]] Life Reimagined ambassador&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/work/experts/emilio-estefan/|title=Emilio Estefan, Life Reimagined Ambassador – AARP|work=AARP|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013. In his new role, Emilio shares his expertise on a variety of subjects, including his passion for living, [[mentoring]], [[entrepreneur]]ship, [[philanthropy]], and much more.

In February 2014, Estefan directed and produced the documentary film ''An Unbreakable Bond'' about the real''-''life story of father-son duo Marc and Nick Buoniconti's undying commitment towards finding a cure for paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article177562581.html|title=Marc Buoniconti — paralyzed at 19 — says hit on the football field ‘saved my life’|work=miamiherald|access-date=October 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at National &amp; International film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themiamiproject.org/unbreakablebond|title=An Unbreakable Bond – The Buoniconti Fund|publisher=Themiamiproject.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219233946/http://www.themiamiproject.org/unbreakablebond|archivedate=December 19, 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan at 2014 MIFF.jpg|thumb|[[Gloria Estefan|Gloria]] &amp; Emilio Estefan at the 2014 [[Miami International Film Festival]] premiere of ''An Unbreakable Bond'']]
In early 2014, in a decision unanimously approved by the County Commission, Estefan was appointed Miami-Dade Special Ambassador&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/district02/releases/2013-12-19-emilio-ambassador.asp|title=Miami-Dade County – District 2 –  News Release|publisher=Miamidade.gov|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Miami-Dade County Commissioner [[Jean Monestime]]. In his unpaid
four-year non-partisan role, Emilio was set to represent the Miami-Dade community at an international level to encourage and promote the diversity of business and trade. During the same year, Estefan and Botrán Rum created a strategic marketing alliance including a personal endorsement by Estefan. Through his role, Estefan will help promote the brand throughout the U.S., leading a multi-channel marketing campaign with the mantra "The Night Begins with Botran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2014/02/emilio-estefan-fronts-new-botran-rum-campaign/|title=Emilio Estefan fronts new Botran Rum campaign|access-date=October 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estefan sits as the second vice-chair to the Commission for the [[National Museum of the American Latino]], a bi-partisan commission charged with exploring the possibility of creating a National Latino Museum in Washington D.C.

===Other business ventures===
[[File:Cardozo-hotel-miami-beach.JPG|thumb|right|The Cardozo hotel on [[Ocean Drive (South Beach)|Ocean Drive]], in [[Miami Beach, Florida]].]]
Gloria and Emilio Estefan own a number of business establishments, including several Cuban-themed restaurants ([http://www.bongoscubancafe.com Bongos Cuban Café]; [http://www.lariosonthebeach.com Larios on the Beach]). The restaurants are located in [[Miami Beach]], downtown Miami (part of the American Airlines Arena), at the [[Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood|Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in [[Hollywood, Florida]], [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney Springs]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and in Miami International Airport. They also own two hotels: Costa d'Este in [[Vero Beach]] which opened in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS201461+19-Jun-2008+PRN20080619 | title=Gloria &amp; Emilio Estefan Open Costa d'Este Beach Resort | date=June 19, 2008 | work=Reuters }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Cardozo in [[Miami Beach]]. In June 2009, Estefan and his wife became the first Hispanics to buy a minor ownership stake in an NFL team, the [[Miami Dolphins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/nfl/06/22/estefan.dolphins.ap/index.html "Dolphins announce Estefans' stake in team"], ''Sports Illustrated'' (via AP Miami), June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2009/06/26/Emilio_and_Gloria_Estefan_give_Miami_Dolphins_celebrity_appe/?section=TopStories&amp;template=cheetah-photo-search%2Findex.txt "Emilio and Gloria Estefan give Miami Dolphins celebrity appeal"], ''The Miami Herald'', June 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to articles published in ''People en Español'' and ''AARP Magazine'', the Estefans' estimated net worth as of 2011 was approximately $700 million.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The top business plans from each region will go on to compete in the national competition in Vancouver, BC in early February.

In 2008, 100 teams from 16 different Canadian post-secondary institutions were selected to compete in their respective regional competitions.  Of these 100, the top three were chosen from each of the four regions to compete in the national finals in Vancouver.  Over $80,000 in prize money was awarded in 2008, with a $20,000 business grant awarded to the top team.&lt;ref name="Enterprize 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprize2008.com/|title=Enterprize 2008|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a prize pool worth over $100,000, the 2009 competition will be the largest of its kind in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/news/2008/10/student_busines.html/|title=Student Business Ideas Wanted For National Competition|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fence''', also known as a '''receiver''', '''mover''', or '''moving man''', is an individual who [[mens rea|knowingly]] buys [[stolen goods]] in order to later resell them for profit. The fence acts as a [[wikt:middleman|middleman]] between [[thieves]] and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may not be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: ''The burglar fenced the stolen radio''. This sense of the term came from [[Thieves' cant|thieves' slang]], first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a ''defence'' against being caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.word-detective.com/2013/09/fence/ "Fence"] in the Word Detective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fence |title='&amp;#39;Online Etymology Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a "c" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly [[American English]]) is now spelled ''defense.''

The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he/she is able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for "hot" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. The thieves who patronize the fence are willing to accept a low [[profit margin]] in order to reduce their risks by instantly "washing their hands" of the [[black market]] loot and disassociating themselves from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups their investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing [[serial numbers]]) and reselling the goods as near to the [[white market]] price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a [[pawnshop]], [[flea market]] or [[street vendor]]) in order to "launder" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. &lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wilber |first= Del Quentin |authorlink= Del Quentin Wilber |title= D.C.

==Approach==

[[File:Car window burglary.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Car stereo thieves typically want to sell stolen items quickly. By selling to fences, they avoid the hassle and suspicion of selling directly to the final buyers.]]
The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to pay thieves a very low price for stolen goods. Thieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort ([[transaction costs]]), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any [[used good]]s, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement.

The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace [[serial number]]s on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognized. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle [[chop shop|may be disassembled]] so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops.

Fencing is often conducted through legal businesses.&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt; Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming "front" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, "front" businesses might be discount stores, [[used goods]] stores, a coin and gem store, [[auction house]], [[flea market]], or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each "front" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]] may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline.

The prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question.  Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value.  Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items.  At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt; For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.

Research on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based "wheeling and dealing".  They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods).  Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

There are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorizing fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorizing fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional "sideline" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the "master fences", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

The degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).

== History of receiving ==

The fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society.
 
=== Early modern England ===

Receiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious [[Jonathan Wild]]. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Receiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the [[Transportation Act 1717|1718 Transportation Act]], which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.&lt;ref name="B189"&gt;Beattie, J. M.

The 1718 Transportation Act also made a felony of returning goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.41-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers.
[[File:Ticket to the hanging of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|Ticket to the hanging of [[Jonathan Wild]]. ]]
In order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was in a better position to do so than [[thief-takers]]. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as "pretended Thiefe-taker" in a 1707 document,&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beattie, , J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.159-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.

Confirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of [[Charles Hitchen]], who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief-takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld. Hitchen controlled this network through his official (that is to say, legal) position as a thief-taker.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, pp.253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synergy between receiving, theft and corruption, as well as official activities such as thief-taking or pawnbroking was a huge dynamic bond where each element enhanced the others in a vicious circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The master of this powerful synergy of London underworld was [[Jonathan Wild]], who rapidly replaced his previous master, Charles Hitchen, in 1713, and rapidly gained control of London's crime and the title of "thief-taker general". His power was due to his ruthless thief-taking and intimidation activities as well as a complex web of intelligence also built around the diffusion of newspapers. However, overly bold receiving was his undoing,&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as "Jonathan Wild Act",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock and Schoemaker. Tales from the Hanging Court. London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from £40 to £140).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;

==== Women and receiving ====

Chapel Hill London: U of North Carolina, 1994, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Hitchen, Hitchen's wife, gave her inheritance money to her husband in order to buy the Under City Marshal office for his plans. Moreover, women could also be active fences. For example, Elizabeth Fisher managed her own receiving business in her husband's alehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, and Walker. Women, Crime and the Courts in Early Modern England. Chapel Hill London: U of North Carolina, 1994, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern English literature ===

Receiving grew increasingly important in Early Modern society, and combined with the increasing interest of society on reading, it became the source for many writers, such as [[Daniel Defoe]], with [[Moll Flanders]] and [[John Gay]], with [[The Beggar's Opera]]. 
These works reflect how receiving was conceived and portrayed by authors.

==== Moll Flanders ====

''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is a novel intended to narrate the whole life of its protagonist, referred to as Moll Flanders, but a relevant part of it is about her becoming a master thief. Moll's activity as a thief largely relied on the protection and support of her governess, who acted also as a receiver for the goods stolen by her affiliates. She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates "I was now at a loss for a market for my goods,[...] At last I resolved to go to my old governess." Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves.&lt;ref name="gut"/&gt; With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London.

The Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market. Sometimes, such as in the case of a silver inscribed mug stolen by Moll, she smelts metals, in order to avoid getting caught while re-selling. Along with receiving activity, she actively protects and support many criminals and thieves in order to secure a steady income to her activity.

The same governess goes on in protecting and offering refuge to her affiliates whenever possible, or recruiting thieves into small groups, always via middlemen, in order to protect their thieves' identities in case some of them were caught and willing to confess.

She is also a main intelligence source and often a direct instigator to theft such as in a case of fire in a well-off house in the neighbourhood (more vulnerable to theft because of the sudden emergency), and finally becomes a broker for goods stolen by Moll to a drunken gentleman. In that case, the amount gained is allegedly greater than what she would have gained by standard re-selling in the secondary market.&lt;ref name="gut"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/370/370-h/370-h.htm The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders &amp;c. on Project Gutenberg], accessed on November 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governess embodies female social cunning in London's underworld, from Defoe's point of view. She is a typical receiver of her time, and whereas many male receivers used thief-taking as an official business, she relies on pawnbroking.

==Legal aspects==
Fencing is illegal almost everywhere, usually under a similar rationale as in the United States, where [[receipt of stolen property]] is a crime in every state, as well as a [[federal crime]] if the property crossed a state line. Occasionally federal agents will temporarily set up a false fence [[sting operation]].  Fencing is a common source of income for organized crime.  In [[England and Wales]], as in many U.S. states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

[[Pawnbroker]]s have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Bill. "No Questions Asked: [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] Pawn Shop Businesses Charged in Sting Operation, [[Black market|Black-Market]] Fencing Easy Cash For Burglars &amp; Armed Robbers."

== E-fencing ==

[[File:US Army 51805 Post, AAFES combat increases in juvenile shoplifting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stores have complained that increasingly, shoplifters are stealing goods with the intent of selling them anonymously online. In this photo, a store loss-prevention officer scans the security cameras for shoplifters.]]
E-fencing is the sale of items on the Internet that have been obtained illegally. It is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website [[eBay]], being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property.&lt;ref name="Ebay"&gt;April 11, 2009. EBay: brisk bidding in stolen goods. business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article6074448.ece&lt;/ref&gt;   Classified websites like [[Craigslist]], [[AutoTrader.com]], [[Pennysaver]] online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal [[darknet market]]s.

E-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen [[credit card]]s or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with [[Carding (fraud)|carding]], which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means.

Crime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand.  In the United States, major retailers such as [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing.  Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and [[Amazon.com]]) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property.  Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.&lt;ref name ="seattletimes"&gt;Spencer, Jim. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2014975231_storetheft06.html?syndication=rss "Target, other stores battle theft rings fencing stolen goods on Web"]. [[Minneapolis]] ''[[Star Tribune]]''.  Accessed June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[eBay]] spokesman has stated, "Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay," and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm Online auctions are the newest place to hawk stolen goods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225090233/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm |date=February 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierce |first=Tarik |url= http://www.investortrip.com/how-to-solve-ebays-efencing-problem/ |title=Efencing Theft Problems on eBay |publisher=Investortrip.com |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:His Highness the Khan of Kalat and Sons.jpg|thumbnail|His Highness the Khan of Kalat and Sons, by Fred Bremner.]]
'''Fred Bremner''' (1863–1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Collection: Fred Bremner (Scottish, 1863 - 1941) |publisher=National Galleries Scotland |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/B/4558/artist_name/Fred%20Bremner/page/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Scottish photographer. His portraiture work in [[British India]], spanning 1882 to 1922, preserves a record of life in the period.

==Biography==
Bremner was born in 1863 in [[Aberchirder]] (also known as Foggylone) in [[Scotland]] and was one of several sons of a photographer in [[Banff, Scotland|Banff]]. He left school at the age of thirteen to join his father's studio and worked there for six years. In 1882, Bremner accepted an offer of work from his brother-in-law [[G. W. Lawrie]], who ran a successful photography business in [[Lucknow]], and he was assigned work throughout northern India (modern India and Pakistan).&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhushan Sharma|first1=Brij|title=Fred Bremner's Indian years|journal=History of Photography|date=October 1989|volume=13|issue=4|pages=293–301|doi=10.1080/03087298.1989.10441003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Bremner established his own photographic studio in [[Karachi]], and successively studios in [[Quetta]], [[Lahore]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. He travelled great distances to rarely photographed areas, and his work therefore captures a scarce record of rural life, landscapes and people in late 19th and early 20th century India (his work spans 1882 to 1922).&lt;ref name=SNPG&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucknow to Lahore {{!}} Fred Bremner’s Vision of India|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/exhibitions/lucknow-to-lahore#.UG_VDI5fXHQ|work=[[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]|publisher=[[National Galleries of Scotland]]|accessdate=6 October 2012|location=Edinburgh|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest to military historians are Bremner's photographic studies of British and Indian Army units on station in the North West Frontier region of India (now Pakistan) during the late 1800s. These studies are distinguished by the quality of the plates, which preserve in detail the faces, equipment, uniforms and living conditions of a battalion of the line from this period. Photographed on location with the troops and then sold to order, these books are now extremely rare with very few copies available for public viewing. In particular, the exceptionally rare fine photographic (Collotype Prints) work of the 1st Battalion Wessex Regiment (Late 44th FOOT), Quetta Baluchistan, 1911.

[[File:GenerationAdidas.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Generation Adidas official logo]]
'''Generation Adidas''' is a joint venture between [[Major League Soccer]] and [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] aimed at raising the level of young professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] talent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/354854/us-u-20-players-headline-2006-class|title=U.S. U-20 players headline 2006 class|author=|date=|website=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, sponsored by [[Adidas]], offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the [[MLS SuperDraft]] early entry, allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ussoccerplayers.com/2010/01/mccabe-explains-generation-adidas.html|title=McCabe Explains Generation adidas|author=|date=|website=US Soccer Players}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its establishment in 1997 to 2005, the program was sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and was called '''Project-40'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/resource_center/soccer_history/447766.html|title=US Soccer Players|author=|date=|website=www.ussoccerplayers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool, American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry.

[[Carlos Parra]] was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the [[New York Red Bulls|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in 1997. Since then, the program has included players such as [[Tim Howard]], [[DaMarcus Beasley]], [[Maurice Edu]], [[Carlos Bocanegra]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Jozy Altidore]], [[Ben Olsen]], [[Sacha Kljestan]], [[Freddy Adu]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]], [[Nick Rimando]], and [[Kyle Beckerman]]. 

Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as [[professional]], and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out.

From 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the [[USL First Division|A-League]] in the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]].

In 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Canadian Generation Adidas players count as domestic players on US based MLS teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/04/mls-announces-2017-generation-adidas-class-and-senior-signings&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George William Gordon''' (1820 &amp;ndash; 23 October 1865)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jis.gov.jm/heroes/george-william-gordon/ "George William Gordon"], Jamaica Information Service.&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy [[mixed-race]] [[Jamaica]]n [[businessman]], magistrate and [[politician]], one of two representatives to the Assembly from [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|St. Thomas-in-the-East Parish]].  He was a leading critic of the colonial government and the policies of Jamaican Governor [[Edward Eyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=163850 | title=George William Gordon (Biographical details) | publisher=The British Museum | accessdate=2 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the start of the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] in October 1865, Eyre declared martial law in that area, directed troops to suppress the rebellion, and ordered the arrest of Gordon in Kingston. He had him returned to Morant Bay to stand trial under [[martial law]]. Gordon was quickly convicted of conspiracy and executed, on suspicion of having planned the rebellion. Eyre's rapid execution of Gordon on flimsy charges during the crisis, and the death toll and violence of his suppression of the revolt, resulted in a huge controversy in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Opponents of Eyre and his actions attempted to have him prosecuted for murder, but the case never went to trial. He was forced to resign. The British government passed legislation to make Jamaica a [[Crown Colony]], governing it directly for decades. In 1969, the Jamaican government proclaimed Gordon as a [[Order of National Hero (Jamaica)|National Hero of Jamaica]]

==Early life==
George William Gordon was the second of eight children born in Jamaica &lt;!--where? --&gt;to a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] planter, Joseph Gordon (1790?–1867),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlj.gov.jm/?q=content/national-heroes |title=National Heroes &amp;#124; The National Library of Jamaica |publisher=Nlj.gov.jm |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an enslaved woman, Ann Rattray (1792? – before 1865).&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewilliamgordon.com George William Gordon Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026100539/http://www.georgewilliamgordon.com/ |date=26 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were Mary Ann (1813?), Margaret (1819?), Janet Isabella (1824?), John (1825?), Jane (1826?), Ann (1828?) and Ralph Gordon (1830). Gordon was self-educated, teaching himself to read, write, and perform simple accounting. At the age of ten, he was allowed to live with his godfather, James Daly of [[Black River, Jamaica]]. Within a year, Gordon began working in Daly's business.&lt;ref name="jis"/&gt;

Gordon later moved to [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|St. Thomas-in-the-East Parish]] at the eastern end of the island, where he became a wealthy businessman and a landowner.&lt;ref name="jis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/Heroes/Heroes.htm#George |title=National Heroes |publisher=Jis.gov.jm |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907221543/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/Heroes/Heroes.htm#George |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Gordon was elected from St. Thomas-in-the-East parish as a member of the [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|House of Assembly]]. He earned a reputation by the mid-1860s as a critic of the colonial government, especially Governor [[Edward John Eyre]]. He maintained a correspondence with English evangelical critics of colonial policy. He also established a Native Baptist church, where [[Paul Bogle]] was a deacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jnht.com/jamaica/fact_heroes.php |title=Jamaica National Heritage Trust - Jamaica |publisher=Jnht.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623205418/http://www.jnht.com/jamaica/fact_heroes.php |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was unknown at the time, in May 1865 Gordon attempted to purchase an ex-Confederate schooner with a view to ferrying arms and ammunition to Jamaica from the United States of America.&lt;ref name=Hanford&gt;{{cite journal |last=Handford |first=Peter |title=Edward John Eyre and the Conflict of Laws |url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/32_3_2.pdf |journal=Melbourne University Law Review |publisher= |volume=[2008] |issue= |pages=822–860 |access-date=5 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705025049/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/32_3_2.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 the mass of Jamaicans were ex-slaves and their descendents; they struggled with poverty and crop failure in the mostly rural economy, and the aftermath of crippling epidemics of [[cholera]] and [[smallpox]].

==Death and aftermath==
[[File:George William Gordon - photograph.jpg|thumb|150px]]
In October 1865, following the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]] led by Bogle, Governor Eyre ordered the arrest of Gordon, whom he suspected of planning the rebellion. By order of Eyre, Gordon was transported from [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], where [[martial law]] was not in force, to Morant Bay, where it was. Within two days Gordon was tried for [[high treason]] by [[court-martial]], without [[due process of law]], sentenced to death, and executed on 23 October.&lt;ref&gt;Gad Heuman, ''The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), pp. 146-151.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The execution of Gordon and the brutality of Eyre's suppression of the revolt, with hundreds of Jamaicans killed by soldiers and more executed after trials, made the affair a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' in Britain. [[John Stuart Mill]] and other liberals sought unsuccessfully to have Eyre (and others&lt;ref&gt;Specifically Colonel Abercrombie Nelson and Lieutenant Herbert Brand (Hanford, page 841).&lt;/ref&gt;) prosecuted. When they were unable to get the cases to trial, the liberals worked to bring civil proceedings against Eyre.&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the civil proceedings, see ''[[Phillips v Eyre]]'' (1870) LR 6 QB 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to resign from office but never went to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Heuman, ''The Killing Time'', pp. 164-182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and honours==
[[File:Jamaica 10 dollar.png|thumb|left|300px|George Gordon on the Jamaican ten-dollar note]]
In the 20th-century aftermath of the labour rebellion of 1938, Gordon came to be seen as a precursor of Jamaican [[nationalism]]. The play ''George William Gordon'' (1938) by [[Roger Mais]] was about his life.
 
In 1960 the [[Parliament of Jamaica]] moved into the new Gordon House, named for the politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japarliament.gov.jm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=23 |title=History of Jamaica's Legislature |publisher=Japarliament.gov.jm |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Gordon and Bogle were each proclaimed as Jamaican National Heroes in a government ceremony at [[Morant Bay]].

In 1969, Jamaica converted its currency to a decimal system, and it issued new currency. Gordon was featured on the ten-dollar note (now a coin).

George William Gordon is mentioned in the song "Innocent Blood" and also "See them a come" by the [[reggae]] band [[Culture (band)|Culture]]. He is noted in the song "Silver Tongue Show" by [[Groundation]], "Give Thanks and Praise" by [[Roy Rayon]], "Prediction" and "Born Fe Rebel" by [[Steel Pulse]], and "Our Jamaican National Heroes" by [[Horace Andy]].

'''Guarantee''' is a legal term more comprehensive and of higher import than either [[warranty]] or "security". It most commonly designates a private transaction by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for him.  It may also designate a [[treaty]] through which claims, rights or possessions are secured. It is to be differentiated from the colloquial "personal guarantee" in that a Guarantee is a legal concept which produces an economic effect. A personal guarantee by contrast is often used to refer to a promise made by an individual which is supported by, or assured through, the word of the individual. In the same way, a guarantee produces a legal effect wherein one party affirms the promise of another (usually to pay) by promising to themselves pay if default occurs. 

At law, the giver of a guarantee is called the [[surety]] or the "guarantor". The person to whom the guarantee is given is the [[creditor]] or the "obligee"; while the person whose payment or performance is secured thereby is termed "the obligor", "the principal debtor", or simply "the principal".

Suretys have been classified as follows:
#Those in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the secured creditor is a party;
#those in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger;
#those in which, without any such contract of suretyship, there is a primary and a secondary liability of two persons for one and the same debt, the debt being, as between the two, that of one of those persons only, and not equally of both, so that the other, if he should be compelled to pay it, would be entitled to reimbursement from the person by whom (as between the two) it ought to have been paid.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fox and Co. v. North and South Wales Bank, 6 App. Cas. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Guarantee is sometimes spelt "guarantie" or "guaranty".&lt;ref&gt;The guarantee (person) is sometimes distinguished from the guaranty (obligation).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is from an [[Old French]] form of "warrant", from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word which appears in [[German language|German]] as ''wahren'': to defend or make safe and binding.{{citation needed|reason=source of etymology|date=December 2013}}

==Common law==

===England===
In [[English law]], a guarantee is a [[contract]] whereby the person (the guarantor) enters into an agreement to pay a [[debt]], or effect the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. The extent of the debt that the guarantor is liable to this debt is co-extensive to the obligation of the third-party.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance and is secondary to the primary obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Chitty on Contracts 32nd edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Volume II Chapter 45-001, ''Lakeman v Mountstephen'' [1865] LR 7 HL 17, also cf Halsbury Laws of England &amp; Wales, Para 1013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails. Two forms of guarantee exists in England, (1) Guarantees creating a conditional payment, wherein if the principal fails, the guarantor will pay. Under this form, the guarantee is not enforceable until failure occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; (2) A "See-to-it" obligation where the guarantor's obligation is to ensure that the principal will carry out the obligation. Failure of the principal to do so will automatically make the guarantor in breach of his contractual obligation, on which the creditor can sue.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286&lt;/ref&gt;

The liabilities of a guarantor in law depend upon those of the principal [[debtor]], and when the principal's obligations cease the guarantor's do too,&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286. ''See'' Stacey v. Hill, I KB 666 (1901).  ''See'' Bateson v. Gosling, 1871 L.R. 7, 14&lt;/ref&gt; except in certain cases where the discharge of the principal debtor is by the operation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;''With regard to release of the debtor See'' Finley v Connell Associates [2002] Lloyds Rep PN 62 ''or also In re'' Fitzgeorge ''[[ex parte]]'' Robson, I KB 462 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[co-extensive]], secondary nature of the liability of the guarantor along with the fact that the guarantee is a contract to answer default, debt, or miscarriage; crucially differentiates the guarantee from an indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286 ''Also See'' Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, a person wrongly supposes that someone is liable to them, and a guarantee is given on that erroneous basis, the guarantee is invalid by virtue of the law of contracts, because its foundation (that another was liable) failed.&lt;ref&gt;Mountstephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

No special phraseology is necessary to form a guarantee. What distinguishes a guarantee from [[insurance]] is not any difference between the words "insurance" and "guarantee", but the substance of the contract entered into by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v. Heath-Seaton v. Burnand, I QB 782, 792, C.A. (1899); ''In re'' Denton's Estate Licenses Insurance Corporation and Guarantee Fund Ltd. v. Denton, 2 Ch. 188 (1899); ''see'' Dane v. Mortgage Insurance Corporation, I Q.B. 54 C.A. (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory requisites of a guarantee are, in England, prescribed firstly by the [[statute of frauds]], which provides in section 4 that "no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person, unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some [[memorandum]] or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized". This in effect means that the guarantee are not invalid but are merely unenforceable through a chose in personam. The requirement for a signature in writing was clarified in ''Elpis Maritimes Co v Marti Chartering Co Inc (the "Maria D") [1992] 1 AC 21'' and ''J Pereia Fernandes SA v Mehta [2006] EWHC 813 (Ch)''. In the latter, it was held that a contract was enforceable either by written agreement signed by the guarantor or his agent OR; if the guarantee was oral, a separate note or memorandum of the agreement could make the guarantee similarly enforceable. In the former, the court held it was sufficient that it was written or printed by the guarantor, a initial within an email was sufficient but a standard header name in an email was not. The court believed that the minor action was sufficient to engage the Statute as it had long been held that a single fingerprint, or "X" was sufficient. The [[Electronic Communications Act 2000]] created a power to issue statutory instruments to modify legislation so as to be congruent with modern use of electronic communications. This is congruent with Article 9 of the [[EU Directive on Electronic Commerce 2000]], this specifically allowed exceptions to the 'in writing' requirement of a guarantee. It has even been held that clicking a button to confirm personal details sufficiently discharges the Statute of Frauds requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Beale and Griffiths (2000) LMCLQ 467, 473&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requisite is Lord Tenterden's Act&lt;ref&gt;9 Geo. IV. c. 14 §6&lt;/ref&gt; which enacts that "no action shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon or by reason of any representation or assurance made or given concerning or relating to the character, conduct, credit, ability, trade or dealings of any other person, to the intent or purpose that such other person may obtain credit, money or goods upon unless such representation or assurance be made in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith".&lt;ref&gt;i.e. "upon credit"Lyde v. Barnard, 1 M. &amp; W. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Tenterden's Act, which applies to [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] companies and to individual persons,&lt;ref&gt;Hirst v. West Riding Union Banking Co., 2 K.B. 560 C.A. (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; was rendered necessary by an evasion of the statute of frauds, treating the guarantee for a debt, default or miscarriage, when not in writing as a fraudulent representation, giving rise to damages for a [[tort]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasley v. Freeman, 3 T.R. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Scotland, where a guarantee is called a "cautionary obligation," similar enactments to those just specified are contained in the Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 §6, while&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statute of frauds====
{{main article|Statute of frauds}}
The statute of frauds does not invalidate a verbal guarantee, but renders it unenforceable. It may therefore be available to support a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to an action, and money paid under it cannot be recovered.  An [[indemnity]] is not a guarantee within the statute, unless it contemplates the primary liability of a third person. It need not, therefore, be in writing when it is only a promise to become liable for a debt if the person to whom the promise is made should become liable.&lt;ref&gt;Wildes v. Dudlow, L.R. 19 Eq. 198; Harburg India-Rubber Co. v. Martin, 1902, I K.B. 786; Guild v. Conrad, 1894, 2 Q.B. 885 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither does the statute apply to the promise of a [[del credere]] agent to make no sales on behalf of his principal except to persons who are absolutely solvent, and renders the agent liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise. A promise to give a guarantee is within the statute, though not one to procure a guarantee. The general principles which determine what are guarantees within the statute of frauds are: (1) the primary liability of a third person must exist or be contemplated;&lt;ref&gt;Birkmyr v. Darnell, 1 Sm. L.C. Iith ed. 299; Mounistephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 196; L.R. 7 H.L. 17&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the promise must be made to the creditor; (3) there must be no liability by the surety independent of an express promise of guarantee; (4) the main object of the parties to the guarantee must be the fulfilment of a third party's obligation;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Harburg India-Rubber Comb Co. v. Martin, I K.B. 778, 786 (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) the contract entered into must not amount to a [[sales|sale]] by the creditor to the promiser of the security for a debt or of the debt itself&lt;ref&gt;''See'' de Colyar's ''Law of Guarantees and of Principal and Surety'', 3rd ed. pp. 65-161, where these principles are discussed in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards the kind of note or memorandum of the guarantee that will satisfy the statute of frauds, "no special promise to be made, by any person after the passing of this act, to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, being in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, shall be deemed invalid to support an action, suit or other proceeding, to charge the person by whom such promise shall have been made, by reason only that the consideration for such promise does not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document."&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 §3&lt;/ref&gt; Any writing embodying the terms of the agreement between the parties and signed by the party to be charged is sufficient; and the idea of agreement need not be present to the mind of the person signing.&lt;ref&gt;''In re'' Hoyle - Hoyle v. Hoyle, I Ch., 98 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, necessary that the names of the contracting parties should appear somewhere in writing; that the party to be charged, or his agent, should sign the agreement or another paper referring to it; and that, when the note or memorandum is made, a complete agreement shall exist. The memorandum need not be contemporaneous with the agreement itself.&lt;ref&gt;As regards the stamping of the memorandum or note of agreement, a guarantee cannot, in England, be given in evidence unless properly stamped.  [[Stamp Act]] 1891.  A guarantee for the payment of goods, however, requires no stamp. Nor is it necessary to stamp a written representation or assurance as to character within 9 Geo. IV. c. 14.  If under seal, a guarantee may require an [[ad valorem]] [[Revenue stamp|stamp]]; and, on certain prescribed terms, the stamps can be affixed any time after execution.  Stamp Act 1891, 15, amended by 15 of the Finance Act 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, but not apparently elsewhere, there is a distinction between a '''surety''' and a '''guarantor'''.  A surety is usually bound with the principal, at the same time and on the same [[consideration]], while the contract of a guarantor is his own separate undertaking and the guarantor is not liable until [[due diligence]] has been exerted to compel the principal debtor to make good any default. There is no [[privity of contract]] between a surety and the principal debtor.  Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Bain v. Cooper, I Dowl. R. (N.S.) 11, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other common law jurisdictions===
In India a guarantee may be either oral or written&lt;ref&gt;Indian Contract Act §126&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Australia]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Sri Lanka]] it must be in writing.

In the Irish Statute of Frauds&lt;ref&gt;7 Will. III. c. 12&lt;/ref&gt; there are provisions identical with that found in the English Statute of Frauds.

==Civil law==
According to various existing [[civil code]]s, a suretyship, when the underlying obligation is "non-valuable", is null and void unless the invalidity is the result of personal incapacity of the principal debtor&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2012; Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822; Italy, 1899; Netherlands, 1858; Lower Canada, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, however, the mere personal incapacity of a minor to borrow suffices to eliminate the guarantee of a loan made to him&lt;ref&gt;Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822, §2, 1535, 1536&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian codes sanction guarantees expressly entered into "in view of debtor's want of legal capacity" to contract a valid principal obligation &lt;ref&gt;Egyptain Codes, Mixed Suits, 605; Native Tribunals, 496&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese code retains the surety's liability, in respect of an invalid principal obligation, until the latter has been legally rescinded&lt;ref&gt;art. 822, §I&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several codes civil sureties are divided into conventional, legal and judicial,&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2015, 2040 et seq.; Spain, 1823; Lower Canada, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; while the Spanish code further divides them into gratuitous and for valuable [[consideration]].&lt;ref&gt;art. 1, 823&lt;/ref&gt;

The German code civil requires the surety's promise to be verified by writing where he has not executed the principal obligation.&lt;ref&gt;art. 766&lt;/ref&gt;  The Portuguese code renders a guarantee provable by all the modes established by law for the proof of the principal contract&lt;ref&gt;art. 826&lt;/ref&gt; According to most civil codes civil a guarantee like any other contract can usually be made verbally in the presence of witnesses and in certain cases (where for instance considerable sums of money are involved) ''sous signature privee''{{Technical statement|date=December 2013}} or by a judicial or notarial [[legal instrument|instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codes Civil, France and Belgium 1341; Spain, 1244; Portugal 2506, 2513; Italy, 1341 et seq.; Pothier's ''Law of Obligations'', Evans's ed. i. 257; ''Burge on Suretyship'', p. 19; van der Linden's ''Institutes of Holland'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The French and Belgian Codes, moreover, provide that suretyship is not to be presumed but must always be expressed&lt;ref&gt;art. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract law==
{{Main article|Contract|Offer and acceptance|Meeting of the minds}}
In England the common-law requisites of a guarantee are the same as any other [[contract]]. The mutual assent of two or more parties, competency to contract and valuable consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Pillan v. van Mierop and Hopkins, 3 Burr. 1666; Haigh v. Brooks, 10 A. &amp; E. 309; Barrell v. Trussell, 4 Taunt. 117; [[Indian Contract Act 1872]] §127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If the guarantee is made "under [[seal (device)|seal]]" no consideration may be required.  However, sealed contracts without consideration are no longer valid in most common law jurisdictions.{{citation needed|reason=support obsolescence of sealed contracts|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An offer to guarantee must be accepted, either by express or implied acceptance.

If a surety's assent to a guarantee has been procured by [[fraud]] by the person to whom it is given, there is no binding contract.  [[Fraud]] may consist of suppression, concealment or misrepresentation.  However, only facts that are really material to the risk undertaken need be spontaneously disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v. Burn and Burn v. Seaton, 1900 A.C. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The competency of the parties to enter into a contract of guarantee may be affected by [[insanity]] or [[substance intoxication|intoxication]] of the surety, if known to the creditor, or by any disability. The ordinary disabilities are those of [[minor (law)|minors]].

In some guarantees the consideration is "entire". For example, in consideration for a [[lease]] being granted, the surety becomes answerable for the performance of the [[covenant (law)|covenants]] of the lease.  In other cases it is "fragmentary" or supplied from time to time, as where a guarantee is given to secure the balance of a running account at a bank, for goods supplied&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's v. Harper, 16 Ch. Div. 319&lt;/ref&gt; When the consideration is "entire", the guarantee runs on through the duration of the lease and is irrevocable. When the consideration is "fragmentary", unless the guarantee stipulates to the contrary, the surety may at any time terminate his liability under the guarantee.

Total [[failure of consideration]] or illegal consideration by the party giving a guarantee will prevent its being enforced. Though in all countries the mutual assent of two or more parties is essential to the formation of any contract,&lt;ref&gt;''See e.g.'' Codes Civil, Fr. and Bel. 1108; Port. 643, 647 et seq.; Spain, 1258, 1261; Italy, 1104; Holt. 1356; Lower Canada, 984&lt;/ref&gt; a consideration is not everywhere regarded as a necessary element.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Pothier's ''Law of Obligations'', Evans's edition vol. ii. p. l9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in Scotland a contract may be binding without a consideration to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Stair i. to. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liability==
{{Main article|Legal liability}}
The liability incurred by a surety under his guarantee depends upon its terms, and is not necessarily coextensive with that of the principal debtor. It is, however, obvious that the surety's obligation cannot exceed that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;de Colyar, ''Law of Guarantees'', 3rd ed. p. 233; Burge, ''Suretyship'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; By many existing civil codes, however, a guarantee which imposes on the surety a greater liability than that of the principal is not invalidated but is merely reducible to that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2013; Portugal 823; Spain, 1826; Italy, 1900; Netherlands, 1859; Lower Canada, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; However, in India the liability of the surety is, unless otherwise provided by contract, coextensive with that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Contract Act 1872 §128&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the liability of the surety is less extensive in amount than that of the principal debtor, questions have arisen in England and America as to whether the surety is liable only for part of the debt equal to the limit of his liability, or, up to such limit, for the whole debt.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis v. Emmanuel, 4 Ex. Div. 157; Hobson v. Bass, 6 Ch. App. 792; Brandt, ''Suretyship'', sec. 219&lt;/ref&gt; The surety cannot be made liable except for a loss sustained by reason of the default guaranteed against. Moreover, in the case of a [[joint and several liability|joint and several guarantee]] by several sureties, unless all sign it none are liable thereunder.&lt;ref&gt;National Pro. Bank of England v. Brackenbury 1906, 22 Times L.R. 797&lt;/ref&gt;  The limit of the surety's liability must be construed so as to give effect to what may fairly be inferred to have been the intention of the parties as expressed in writing. In cases of doubtful import, recourse to [[parol evidence]] is permissible, to explain, but not to contradict, the written evidence of the guarantee.

As a general rule, the surety is not liable if the principal debt cannot be enforced. It has never been actually decided in England whether this rule holds good in cases where the principal debtor is a minor and on that account is not liable to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Kimball v. Newell 7 Hill (N.Y.) 116&lt;/ref&gt; When directors guarantee the performance by their company of a contract which is [[ultra vires|beyond their authority]], and therefore not binding on the company, the directors' liability is enforceable against them personally.&lt;ref&gt;Yorkshire Railway Waggon Co. v. Maclure, 21 Ch. D. 309 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination of liability===
It is not always easy to determine for how long liability under a guarantee endures. Sometimes a guarantee is limited to a single transaction, and is obviously intended to be security against one specific default only. On the other hand, it as often happens that it is not exhausted by one transaction on the faith of it, but extends to a series of transactions, and remains a standing security until it is revoked, either by the act of the parties or by the death of the surety. It is then termed a continuing guarantee.

No fixed rules of interpretation determine whether a guarantee is a continuing one or not, but each case must be judged on its individual merits.  Frequently, in order to achieve a correct construction, it becomes necessary to examine the surrounding circumstances, which often reveal what was the subject matter which the parties contemplated when the guarantee was given, and what was the scope and object of the transaction between them. Most continuing guarantees are either ordinary business securities for advances made or goods supplied to the principal debtor or else bonds for the good behavior of persons in public or private offices or employment. With regard to the latter class of continuing guarantees, the surety's liability is, generally speaking, revoked by any change in the constitution of the persons to or for whom the guarantee is given.&lt;ref&gt;Partnership Act 1890 §18, which applies to Scotland as well as England, provides that "a continuing guarantee or cautionary obligation given either to a firm or to a third person in respect of the transactions of a firm, is, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, revoked as to future transactions by any change in the constitution of the firm to which, or of the firm in respect of the transactions of which the guaranty or obligation was given." This section is mainly declaratory of the English common law, which indicates that the changes in the persons to or for whom a guarantee is given may consist either of an increase in their number, of a diminution thereof caused by death or [[retirement]] from business, or of the incorporation or consolidation of the persons to whom the guarantee is given.&lt;/ref&gt;  In England the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to vary the character of any security, for good behavior by the heads of public departments&lt;ref&gt;Government Offices (Security) Act 1875, Amended by the Statute Law Revision Act 1883&lt;/ref&gt; given by companies for the due performance of the duties of an office or employment in the public service.

===Limitation of liability===
Before the surety can be rendered liable on his guarantee, the principal debtor must have made default. When, however, this has occurred, the creditor, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, may sue the surety, without informing him of such default having taken place before proceeding against the principal debtor or resorting to [[securities]] for the debt received from the latter. In those countries where the municipal law is based on the [[Roman law]], sureties usually possess the right (which may, however, be renounced by them) of compelling the creditor to insist on the goods, etc. (if any) of the principal debtor being first "discussed," i.e., appraised and sold, and appropriated to the liquidation of the debt guaranteed before having recourse to the sureties.&lt;ref&gt;''See Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2021 et seq.; Spain, 1830, 1831; Portugal 830; Germany, 771, 772, 773; Netherlands, 1868; Italy, 1907; Lower Canada, 1941-1942; Egypt [mixed suits] 612; ibid. [native tribunals] 502&lt;/ref&gt; This right "accords with a common sense of justice and the natural equity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Hayes v. Ward, 4 Johns. New York, Ch. Cas. p. 132, (opinion by Kent, [[Chancellor]]&lt;/ref&gt; In England this right has never been fully recognized, nor does it prevail in America and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 §8&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, however, before any demand for payment has been made by the creditor on the surety, the latter can, as soon as the principal debtor has made default, compel the creditor, on giving him an [[indemnity]] against costs and expenses, to sue the principal debtor if the latter is solvent and able to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v. Bradford Banking Company 1894, 2 Ch. 75; Wright v. Simpson, 6 Yes. 733&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar remedy is also open to the surety in America.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Brandt on Suretyship'', p. 290 ¶205 Extent of surety's liability&lt;/ref&gt;  In neither of these countries nor in Scotland can one of several sureties, when sued for the whole guaranteed debt by the creditor, compel the latter to divide his claim among the sureties, and reduce it to the share and proportion of each surety. However, this ''beneficium divisionis'', as it is called in Roman law, is recognized by many existing codes.&lt;ref&gt;France and Belgium 2025-2027; Spain, 1837; Portugal, 835- 836; Germany, 426; Netherlands, 1873-1874; Italy, 1911-1912; Lower Canada, 1946; Egypt [mixed suits], 615,616&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement of liability===
The usual mode in England of enforcing liability under a guarantee is by action in the [[Her Majesty's High Court of Justice in England|High Court]] or a [[County court#England and Wales|County Court]]. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress by means of a set-off or [[counterclaim]], in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial.  The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the principal debtor.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte'' Young ''In re'' Kitchin, 17 Ch. Div. 668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, 1883 §37&lt;/ref&gt;

A person liable as a surety for another under a guarantee possesses rights against the person to whom the guarantee was given. As regards the surety's rights against the principal debtor, where the guarantee was made with the debtors consent but not otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Hodgson, v. Shaw, 3 Myl. &amp; K. 190&lt;/ref&gt; after he has made default, be compelled by the surety to exonerate him from liability by payment of the guaranteed debt.&lt;ref&gt;Antrobus v. Davidson, 3 Meriv. 569, 579; Johnston v. Salvage Association, 19 Q.B.D. 460, 461; and Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 2 Ch. 514 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the surety has paid any portion of the guaranteed debt, the surety is entitled to rank as a creditor for the amount paid and to compel repayment.

In the event of the principal debtor's bankruptcy, the surety can in England act against the bankrupt's estate, not only in respect of payments made before the bankruptcy of the principal debtor, but also, it seems, in respect of the contingent liability to pay under the guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Ex parte'' Delmar re Herepath, 38 W.R. 752 (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the creditor has already acted, the surety who has paid the guaranteed debt has a right to all dividends received by the creditor from the bankrupt in respect to the guaranteed debt, and to stand in the creditor's place as to future [[dividend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This right is, however, often waived by the guarantee stipulating that, until the creditor has received full payment of all sums over and above the guaranteed debt, due to him from the principal debtor, the surety shall not participate in any dividends distributed from the bankrupt's estate amongst his creditors.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights of the surety against the creditor are in England exercisable even by one who in the first instance was a principal debtor, but has since become a surety, by arrangement with his creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v. The Bradford Banking Co., 1894 A.C. 586&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of surety against the creditor===
The surety's principal right against the creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, to the benefit of all [[securities]] which the creditor held against the principal debtor.  If the creditor has lost these securities by default or [[laches (equity)|laches]] or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged [[pro tanto]]. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon v. Steel, 1901, 2 Ch. 602&lt;/ref&gt;  "[E]very person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in [[equity (legal concept)|equity]], in order to obtain from the principal debtor, or any co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person shall be justly liable".&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856, §5&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the surety to be [[subrogation|subrogated]] on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor is recognized in America&lt;ref&gt;Tobin v. Kirk, 80 New York S.C.R. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2029; Spain, 1839; Portugal 839; Germany, - 994; Netherlands, 1877; Italy, 1916; Lower Canada, 2959; Egypt [mixed suits], 617; ibid. [native tribunals], 505&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of surety against other sureties===
A surety is entitled to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is not the result of any contract, but is derived from a [[equity (legal concept)|equity]], on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case of a surety for a surety;&lt;ref&gt;''See ''In re'' Denton's Estate, 1904, 2 Ch. 178 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 1893, 2 Ch. 514&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.

The Roman law did not recognize the right of contribution among sureties. It is, however, sanctioned by many existing codes.&lt;ref&gt;Code Civil France and Belgium 2033; Germany, 426,474; Italy, 1920; Netherlands, 1881; Spain, 1844; Portugal 845; Lower Canada, 1955; Egypt [mixed suits], 618, ibid. [native tribunals], 506; Indian Contract Act 1872, §§146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discharge of liability===
The most prolific ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from the creditor's conduct.  The governing principle is that if the creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only [[nominal damages|nominal]], the guarantee cannot be enforced.  The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, or of that between the creditor and the surety;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Rickaby v. Lewis, 22 T.L.R. 130&lt;/ref&gt; (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the principal debtor from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a [[novation]]. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2034, 2038; Spain 1847; Portugal 848; Lower Canada, 1956; 1960; Egypt [mixed suits], 622, ibid. [native tribunals], 509; Indian Contract Act 1872, sec. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codes Civil France and Belgium 2037; Spain, 1852; Portugal 853; Germany, 776; Italy, 1928; Egypt [mixed suits], 623&lt;/ref&gt; although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil,&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil Spain, 1851; Portugal 852&lt;/ref&gt; is rejected by the majority of them.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil France and Belgium 2039; Netherlands, 1887; Italy, 1930; Lower Canada, 1961; Egypt [mixed suits], 613; ib. [native tribunals], 503); ''see'' Morice, ''English and Dutch Law'', p. 96; van der Linden, ''Institutes of Holland'', pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.

The [[death]] of a surety does not per se determine the guarantee, but, save where from its nature the guarantee is irrevocable by the surety himself, it can be revoked by express notice after his death, or by the creditor becoming receiving [[constructive notice]] of the death; except where, under the testator's [[will (law)|will]], the [[executor]] has the option of continuing the guarantee, in which case the executor should specifically withdraw the guarantee in order to terminate it.  If one of a number of joint and several sureties dies, the future liability of the survivors continues, at least until it has been terminated by express notice.  In such a case, however, the estate of the deceased surety would be relieved from liability. The [[statute of limitations]] may bar the right of action on guarantees subject to variation by statute in any [[U.S. state]] where the guarantee is sought to be enforced.

According to Forbes, he was the second richest Swedish billionaire in 2013. {{As of|2016|07}}, Forbes reported his net worth as $12.5 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; {{As of|2013|05|17}}, ''Bloomberg Billionaires Index'' estimated Rausing's net worth to be $13.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/hans-rausing/ Forbes Billionaires Sweden 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rausing was born in [[Gothenburg]] in 1926 as the second son to industrialist [[Ruben Rausing]] and his wife Elisabeth (née Varenius). Rausing had two brothers, [[Gad Rausing|Gad]] and Sven.

==Career==
Rausing studied Economics, Statistics and Russian at [[Lund University]], graduating in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality. A company history with a difference'', Lund: Tetra Pak International, 1996 ({{ISBN|91-630-4789-6}}), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Rausing was appointed Managing Director of Tetra Pak and his brother Gad Deputy Managing Director.&lt;ref name=Leander29&gt;Leander (1996), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Rausing became Chairman of the Tetra Pak board in 1985.&lt;ref name=Leander29 /&gt; He left the company in 1993 and sold his 50% share of the company to Gad in 1995.&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;Frederick C.

Encyclopedia.com, retrieved 22 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetra Pak's success in the 1970s and 1980s has been credited to the leadership of Hans and Gad Rausing, who turned the six-person family business into a multi-national company.&lt;ref name=Ingram /&gt; Over the course of his career, Rausing became a specialist in Russian affairs and has made many investments in Russia and Ukraine. He was responsible for the Tetra Pak's Russian market, and negotiated the first Tetra Pak machine export to the Soviet Union in 1959, eventually making Tetra Pak the largest foreign employer in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4779/is_12/ai_n28975205/pg_3/?tag=content;col1 Hans Rausing] European Business Forum, retrieved 4 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King Hassan II''' ({{lang-ar|الْحسْنُ الثاني بْن مُحَمَّدُ بْن يوسف بْن الْحسْنِ بْن الشَّرِيفِ بْن عَلِيُّ الْعَلَوِيِّ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/durafakhira#mode/2up|title='' الدرر الفاخرة بمآثر الملوك العلويين بفاس الزاهرة ''}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]]: (a)l-ḥasan aṯ-ṯānī, [[Maghrebi Arabic]]: el-ḥasan ett(s)âni); 9 July 1929 – 23 July 1999) was [[Monarch|King]] of [[Morocco]] from 1961 until his death in 1999. He was the eldest son of [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V, Sultan, then King of Morocco]] (1909–1961), and his second wife, [[Lalla Abla bint Tahar]] (1909–1992). Hassan was known to be one of the most severe rulers of Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Morocco/morocco13.htm|title=MOROCCO13|website=www.royalark.net|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Hassan was educated at the Imperial College at [[Rabat]], and earned a [[law]] degree from the [[University of Bordeaux]].

He was exiled to [[Corsica]] by French authorities on 20 August 1953, together with his father Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]]. They were transferred to [[Madagascar]] in January 1954. Prince Moulay Hassan acted as his father's political advisor during the exile. Mohammed V and his family returned from exile on 16 November 1955.

Prince Moulay Hassan participated in the February 1956 negotiations for Morocco's independence with his father, who later appointed him Chief of Staff of the newly founded [[Forces Armées Royales|Royal Armed Forces]] in April 1956. In the unrest of the same year, he led army contingents battling rebels in the mountains of the [[Rif]]. Mohammed V changed the title of the Moroccan sovereign from [[Sultan]] to [[Monarch|King]] in 1957. Hassan was proclaimed [[Crown Prince]] on 19 July 1957, and became King on 26 February 1961, after his father's death.

===Rule===

Hassan's conservative rule, one characterized by a poor human rights record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7304361.stm|work=BBC|title=Morocco 'Facebook prince' pardon|date=19 March 2008|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; strengthened the [[Alaouite dynasty]].  In Morocco's first constitution of 1963, Hassan II reaffirmed Morocco's choice of a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]], the only one in the [[Maghreb]] at that time. The constitution gave the King large powers he eventually used to strengthen his rule, which provoked strong political protest from the [[UNFP]] and the [[Istiqlal Party|Istiqlal]] parties that formed the backbone of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleijeses|first=Piero|authorlink=Piero Gleijeses|year=1996|title=Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961–1965|journal=[[Journal of Latin American Studies]]|volume=28|issue=1|pages=159–195|jstor=157991|doi=10.1017/s0022216x00012670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Hassan dissolved Parliament and ruled directly, although he did not abolish the mechanisms of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. When elections were eventually held, they were mostly rigged in favour of loyal parties. This caused severe discontent among the opposition, and protest demonstrations and riots challenged the King's rule. A US report observed that "Hassan appears obsessed with the preservation of his power rather than with its application toward the resolution of Morocco's multiplying domestic problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleijeses|first=Piero|authorlink=Piero Gleijeses|year=1996|title=Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961–1965|journal=[[Journal of Latin American Studies]]|volume=28|issue=1|pages=159–195|jstor=157991|doi=10.1017/s0022216x00012670}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Hassan II, Marrakech, 1966.jpg|thumb|400px|King Hassan II, on his way to Friday prayers in [[Marrakesh]], 1967.]]
In the early 1970s, King Hassan survived two [[Assassination|assassination attempt]]s. The [[1971 Moroccan coup attempt|first]], in 1971, was a [[coup d'état]] attempt allegedly supported by [[Libya]], organized by General [[Mohamed Medbouh]] and Colonel [[M'hamed Ababou]] and carried out by cadets during a diplomatic function at the King's summer palace in [[Rabat]] during his forty-second birthday party. Important guests, including the [[Belgium|Belgian]] Ambassador Marcel Dupert, were placed under [[house arrest]], and the King himself was taken to a small pavilion.

Rabat's main radio station was taken over by the rebels and broadcast propaganda stating that the King had been murdered and a republic founded. The coup ended the same day when royalist troops took over the palace in combat against the rebels. It was subsequently claimed by the Moroccan authorities that the young cadets had been misled by senior officers into thinking that they were acting to protect the king.

On 16 August 1972, during a [[1972 Moroccan coup attempt|second attempt]], four [[Northrop F-5|F-5]] military jets from the [[Royal Moroccan Air Force]] fired upon the King's [[Boeing 727]] while he was travelling back to [[Rabat]] from France, many bullets hit the fuselage but they failed to bring the plane down. Allegedly, the King himself hurried to the cockpit, took control of the radio and shouted: "Stop firing you fools, the Tyrant is dead!" Eight people were killed when the jets strafed the awaiting reception dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;"Jets attack Moroccan King's plane", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17 August 1972&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Mohamed Oufkir]], Morocco's defense minister, was the man behind the coup and was officially declared to have committed [[suicide]] after the attack. His body, however, was found with several bullet wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s340307.htm |title=Interview with Malika Oufkir |last=Byrne |first=Jennifer |website=Foreign Correspondent |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |date=11 July 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Cold War]] era, Hassan II allied Morocco with the West generally, and with the [[United States]] in particular. There were close and continuing ties between Hassan II's government and the CIA, who helped to reorganize Morocco's security forces in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Victoria Brittain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,515405,00.html|title=Ben Barka killed with French help|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 July 2001|accessdate=19 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan served as a back channel between the Arab world and [[Israel]], facilitating early negotiations between them. This was made possible due to the presence in Israel of a large [[Moroccan Jewish]] community.
{{History of Morocco}}
During his reign, Morocco recovered the Spanish-controlled area of [[Ifni]] in 1969, and militarily seized two thirds of [[Spanish Sahara]] through the "[[Green March]]" in 1975. The latter issue continues to dominate Moroccan foreign policy to this day. Relations with [[Algeria]] have deteriorated sharply due to the [[Western Sahara]] affair, as well as due to Moroccan claims on Algerian territory ([[Tindouf]] and [[Bechar]]), which unleashed the brief 1963 [[Sand War]]. Relations with [[Mauritania]] were tense too, as Morocco only recognized it as a sovereign country in 1969, nearly a decade after Mauritania's independence, because of Moroccan claims on the country (see [[Great Morocco]]).

Economically, Hassan II adopted a [[market economy|market-based economy]], where [[agriculture]], [[tourism]], and [[phosphate]]s mining industries played a major role.

The period from the 1960s to the late 1980s was labelled as the "[[Years of Lead (Morocco)|years of lead]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6256131.stm|work=BBC|title=Laughter, freedom and religion in Morocco|date=13 January 2007|accessdate=4 May 2010|first=Richard|last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Joffé|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9403363/Morocco|title=Morocco|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw thousands of dissidents jailed, killed, exiled or [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]].

King Hassan II had extended many parliamentary functions{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} by the early 1990s and released hundreds of political prisoners in 1991, and allowed the [[Alternance]], where the opposition assumed power, for the first time in the [[Arab World]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} He set up a Royal Council for Human Rights to look into allegations of abuse by the State.

===Death===
Hassan died of natural causes; he was in his birth town at the age of 70 on 23 July 1999. A national funeral service was held for him in [[Rabat]], with over 40 heads of state in attendance. He was buried in the [[Mausoleum of Mohammed V]]. The coffin of Hassan II, carried by King Mohammed VI, his brother Prince Moulay Rachid and his cousin Moulay Hicham, was covered with a green fabric, in which the first prayer of Islam, "There is no god but God", is inscribed in golden writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18135759.html Highbeam]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrity management consulting''' is an emerging sector of [[consultancy]] that advises individuals and corporations on how to apply the highest ethical standards to every aspect of their business. [[Integrity]] within a corporate set up is a holistic approach that makes prudent and ethical decisions not only relating to finance but other areas as well, which include operations, marketing, human resources as well as manufacturing by adhering to the highest standards of product quality, open and clear communication and transparency in all operations as well as relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics Ethical Decision Making &amp; Cases|last=Ferrell|first=O C|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=978-1-305-50084-6|location=|pages=63|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of integrity management is the belief that companies have a strong interest, as well as a responsibility, to act with integrity at all times. This field arose in response to 

(a) the increased perception that companies are more likely to succeed when they act with integrity and 

(b) increased awareness by company directors of the need to seek expert advice to help them align and incorporate high ethical standards with business strategy and integrate them across all operational functions.

In recent years, the general public have become both better informed and more concerned about business [[ethics]] at home and in developing countries. As a result governments have been called on to legislate, and business leaders to innovate, to ensure that high ethical standards are put at the heart of business and industry. There have been numerous regulations and ethical compliance measures to monitor financial performance of the organization. To complement these regulations and to present a fully dimensional ethical view of the organization from within, companies adopt different models such as [[Six Sigma]], the [[Balanced scorecard|Balanced Scorecard]] and the [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics Ethical Decision Making &amp; Cases|last=Ferrell|first=O C|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=978-1-305-50084-6|location=|pages=256|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of integrity management consulting aims to address:

# The demand for companies to respond to increasing awareness of ethical misconduct and resulting expectations for transparency and accountability;
# The requirement for companies to comply with a stricter legal framework and avoid prosecution for [[unethical]] behavior; and,
# The desire for executives to make their enterprises leaders in responsible and [[sustainable development]].

==Increased public awareness and expectations==
Media attention given to ethical lapses means that companies are increasingly being held responsible for unethical behavior including [[corruption]], labor issues and the poor working conditions in their own operations, in those of their subsidiaries, as well as for the actions of subcontractors acting on their behalf. An early example of the demand for responsibility starting to take hold was in the early 1990's when the reputation of a major footwear corporation was severely damaged, the brand devalued, and the company subjected to consumer boycotts after the discovery of the supplier’s poor labor standards. Child labor watchdogs found children as young as 10 working for Nike making shoes, clothing and footballs in Pakistan and Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Boggan, Steve. "Nike admits to mistakes over child labour." The Independent 20 October 2001. . 4 July 2010 &lt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nike-admits-to-mistakes-over-child-labour-631975.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appalling workplace conditions have existed for centuries. However, the media has now made ethical transgressions readily public. In fact, according to a briefing by the [[Institute of Business Ethics]], in 2009 there were 25 media stories on corporate ethical lapses in the extractive industries alone. Reported issues for this sector included environmental matters and allegations of human rights abuses in emerging markets, as well as accusations that oil companies were dumping toxic material in West Africa. The briefing also highlighted the amount of negative media attention given to the wider retail sector in 2009. Numerous stories exposed unethical practices, such as exploiting [[sweatshop]] labor, and accused some retailers of posing a danger to indigenous communities in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Business Ethics. Concerns &amp; Ethical Lapses, 2009. Issue 15, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of such negative exposure can include:
* damaged corporate reputations and brand devaluation
* lower employee moral
* consumer boycotts
* loss of market share
* negative perceptions on behalf of investors
* legal action and
* fines and in some jurisdictions jail terms for directors.

According to [[Transparency International]] (TI), which investigates business corruption across the globe, ` and corruption were partly to blame for the recent global economic crisis of 2007-2008. The conditions cited included: serious lapses in corporate due diligence, governance and integrity; poor transparency and accountability; and, inadequate corporate integrity systems.&lt;ref&gt;“Transparency International”. Transparency International’s Global Corruption Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide recession has furthered the public’s demand for businesses to behave responsibly.

==More stringent legal requirements==
Stricter legal frameworks have made it easier to prosecute transgressors and new international initiatives are helping countries to work in collaboration to deter poor business ethics.

The [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] (officially OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions) is a convention of the OECD, ratified by 41 countries and aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries by encouraging sanctions against bribery in international business transactions carried out by companies based in member countries. Countries that have signed the Convention are required to put in place legislation that criminalizes the act of bribing a foreign public official. Much of the legislation passed by member countries has international reach.

One such example is the [[Bribery Act 2010]] which was enacted into law on 8 April and defines three discrete criminal offences: offering or paying a [[bribe]]; requesting or receiving a bribe; bribing a foreign public official.  (A specific offence required to comply with the OECD Convention mentioned above); and a new corporate offence of failing to prevent bribery being undertaken on its behalf. The Act applies to UK companies, UK partnerships, UK citizens and individuals ordinarily resident in the UK, regardless of where the relevant act occurs. They also apply to non-UK nationals, companies, and partnerships if an act or omission forming part of the offence takes place within the UK.

The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] of 1977(FCPA)(15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, et seq.) is a United States federal law with international reach which also targets unethical behavior. The Act is known primarily for two of its main provisions: one that addresses accounting transparency requirements under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]](SEC); and, another concerning bribery of foreign officials. The FCPA applies to individuals and businesses with securities registered in the United States or a principal place of business in the United States. While this Act has been in existence for quite some time, the SEC and the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] have recently increased their enforcement efforts.

A well-known example of a company prosecuted under the FCPA is German car maker, Daimler, which agreed to pay US $185 million in fines to the US government over alleged bribes paid to secure contracts abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andrew. "Daimler settles US bribery charges." The Guardian 24 March 2010. Business. 4 July 2010 &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/24/daimler-settles-us-bribery-charges&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; BAE Systems PLC, a UK-based defense contractor also agreed to pay a US $400 million fine in FCPA related enforcement action.There are numerous other examples.In existence for around 40 years now, the FCPA is a very powerful tool in the hands of US DOJ and SEC which they use as a weapon of recovery of billions of dollars from foreign corporations worldwide over which US authorities have little jurisdiction.

Most recently, the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (also known as the Financial Reform Act) signed into U.S. law by President [[Barack Obama]] on July 21, 2010 contains a clause that specifically requires companies with products containing [[cassiterite]] (tin ore), columbite-tantalite ([[coltan]]), [[wolframite]], and gold to disclose to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) whether the minerals are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. Companies will have to detail the measures they have taken to avoid sourcing the minerals from Congolese armed groups, which are guilty of massacres and other atrocities. The bill also requires that all information disclosed be independently audited.

This legislation underpins some of the reasons businesses are taking integrity seriously and enlisting integrity management consultancies. Many businesses leaders have realized that early adopters of strong corporate ethics will thrive, as did those quick to embrace the environmental agenda in recent years. Consumers and shareholders are increasingly ready to recognize the value of corporate responsibility in international business. Increasingly, responsibility and sustainable value are intertwined.

==Role of consultancies==
In response, the field of integrity management has been born to help clients conduct business, even in the most challenging of markets, without compromising their ethics. With the help of expert advice, companies can go beyond abiding by the law to taking a voluntary, proactive approach to ensuring a company’s activities promote behaving responsibly, with fairness, sustainability, and cultural sensitivity in the communities in which they operate. It is very different in this respect from the more reactive field of risk management, although some risk management companies have attempted to embrace ethical risk as an area of specialism. Many risk management consultancies are adjuncts to private security companies. Therefore, some would-be clients are not convinced that they are best-placed to assist in the area of integrity and ethical management, because their parent companies face reputational challenges themselves.

Specialist integrity management consultancy helps business leaders not only to avoid business practices that represent risk to an industry or economy, but also helps to bring such practices under scrutiny so that they can be brought to a quick end.

The practice of integrity management consultancy combines numerous disciplines including established Knowledge Acquisition Methodologies, Public Relations Practices, Business Risk Management techniques, [[Corporate Social Responsibility|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)]], Compliance functions, Insider Threat detection and Financial expertise to help clients make responsible and ethical business decisions.

Integrity management consultancies offer services such as: Identifying potential reputational and ethical threats for clients, and developing practical recommendations to mitigate these threats; making recommendations for, and carrying out [[due diligence]] on, local professional service suppliers; providing advice on accessing a local pool of talent, and addressing cultural considerations for building an effective local workforce; conducting detailed investigations into proposed local partners and key employees; preparing community needs reviews for better targeting of CSR programmes; and, administering anti-and counter-corruption training. Many also offer general ethics audits so that companies can obtain independent verification to attest to the high standard of their corporate ethics. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list as each consultancy offers different services.

'''Javier González Fraga''' (born May 12, 1948) is an Argentine economist and businessman. He served as President of the [[Central Bank of Argentina]] from 1989 to 1991, and was nominated as running-mate by [[Ricardo Alfonsín]] for his [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 campaign]] for the Presidency.

==Life and times==
González Fraga was born in [[Buenos Aires]] as the youngest of four children to Elvira Fraga and N. González Casartelli.&lt;ref name=alcurnia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogiafamiliar.net/getperson.php?personID=I19994&amp;tree=BVCZ|title=Javier González Fraga|publisher=Genealogía Familiar}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a degree in [[Economics]] with honors at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]],&lt;ref name=konex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionkonex.org/b1184-javier_a_gonzalez_fraga|title=Javier A. González Fraga|publisher=Fundación Konex}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1974, was brought on by ''[[La Nación]]'', one of the nation's leading news dailies, as a financial columnist.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideared.org/coloquio39/expositores/gonzalez_fraga.asp|title=Javier González Fraga. Curriculum vitae|publisher=Idea}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later earned a fellowship at the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] at [[Harvard University]], and at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=konex/&gt; He married Bárbara Morea Giménez, and had two children; they later separated.&lt;ref name=alcurnia/&gt; 

He established a [[dairy farm]], ''La Salamandra'', near [[Luján, Buenos Aires]], in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoemprendedores.com.ar/info/leeremprendedor.asp?id=284 |title=Granja La Salamandra |publisher=''Info Emprendedores'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305142216/http://www.infoemprendedores.com.ar/info/leeremprendedor.asp?id=284 |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to write on finance and economics, authoring ''El Mercado de Capitales'' (1982) and ''El Sistema Financiero'' (1980 and 1985).&lt;ref name=idea/&gt; He served as adviser to the [[State enterprise]] bureau during the [[Raúl Alfonsín]] Administration, and was hired by [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] principal [[Ghaith Pharaon]] to manage [[Swap (finance)|debt-equity swaps]] for the bank, as well as [[portfolio investment]]s that included the [[Four Seasons Hotel Buenos Aires|Park Hyatt Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.elargentino.com/notas/javier-gonzalez-fraga-de-alfonsin-pharaon-de-pharaon-alfonsin|title=

===Tenure at the Central Bank===
The election of [[Justicialist Party]] candidate [[Carlos Menem]] in [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989]], and his reliance on the [[agribusiness]] conglomerate [[Bunge &amp; Born]] for economic policy during the presidential transition, gave the company's [[Chief Operating Officer]], Orlando Ferreres, the power to choose most of the new administration's economic team. He recommended the relatively young González Fraga, who was well-known to the local banking sector as a policy consultant, to be the new President of the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]].&lt;ref name=cl625&gt;''Clarín''. Síntesis de la semana. June 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/07/business/international-report-inflation-unites-peronists-and-argentine-business.html?pagewanted=all|title=Inflation Unites Peronists and Argentine Business|publisher=''The New York Times'' | first=Shirley|last=Christian|date=August 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nominee informed the President-elect that he had not voted for him (harboring policy differences, as well, with Bunge &amp; Born personnel);&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ar/Note.aspx?Note=358932|title=Economía, memorias del fuego|publisher=''La Prensa''}}&lt;/ref&gt; González Fraga, nevertheless, was sworn in with the new administration on July 8.

González Fraga leveraged business confidence in the new economic team to stabilize the highly undervalued [[Argentine austral|austral]], and despite favoring greater [[exchange rate flexibility]] in light of the critical need for [[foreign exchange reserves]] (which had declined to around us$120 million, with us$4.5 billion in [[arrears]]),&lt;ref name=cl625/&gt; González Fraga eliminated [[trade finance]] lines of credit and increased [[U.S. dollar]] purchases from exporters. These measures created friction with both the agricultural sector and Bunge &amp; Born itself, though he continued to enjoy Menem's support.&lt;ref name=lp/&gt;   

The austral, which had fallen sharply (from 450 to 650 per dollar) in the days prior to Menem's July 8 inaugural in anticipation of a [[devaluation]], stabilized. The [[1989 riots in Argentina|financial crisis]] continued to exert pressure on prices, however, and monthly inflation reached 197% in July. The [[Argentine mint|National Mint]] could not meet demand for banknotes, and in response, the new Central Bank President ordered the mint to triple production by printing higher denominations on old (circa-1980) [[Peso ley]] templates, and issuing bills printed on only one side. The crisis subsided in August, and by September, monthly inflation was in single digits. González Fraga, however, remained in strained terms with the Bunge &amp; Born-dominated Economy Ministry, and sought as much independence for the Central Bank as possible.&lt;ref name=lp/&gt; Ultimately, however, Economy Minister [[Néstor Rapanelli]]'s opposition to González Fraga's call for a [[floating exchange rate]] led the central banker to resign on November 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/24/business/argentine-bank-head-quits.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22Javier+Gonzalez+Fraga%22&amp;st=nyt|title=Argentine Bank Head Quits|publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=November 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; These news added to concerns that the us$2 billion in new [[portfolio investment]] envisaged in July failed to materialize,&lt;ref name=lp/&gt; and amid a new currency crisis, Rapanelli himself resigned three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/18/business/international-report-ministry-shift-in-argentina.html|title=Ministry shift in Argentina|publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=December 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menem loyalist Antonio Erman González was named President of the Central Bank in March 1990, and González Fraga returned to the institution as its Vice President. A reversal of the roles each had in 1989, this partnership continued when in June, he succeeded Erman González, while the latter retained the Economy Ministry. Even as the nation's finances stabilized, his agenda in the ensuing months was topped by difficult repayment negotiations over mounting foreign debt arrears (which had reached us$6 billion by then),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/business/argentina-to-get-aid-and-begin-debt-talks.html|title=Argentina to Get Aid and Begin Debt Talks|publisher=''The New York Times'' | first=Jonathan|last=Fuerbringer|date=May 10, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by ongoing investigations into [[securities fraud]] allegedly committed against the Central Bank by numerous institutions during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Quintela, Roberto. ''Crisis bancarias y corrupción''. Buenos Aires: Editorial Dunken, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations in January 1991 that Menem Administration officials had solicited [[bribe]]s from beef processor [[Swift &amp; Company]], as well as a renewed currency crisis, led to the resignation of the entire economic team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/29/business/bank-holiday-in-argentina-as-currency-plunges-12.5.html?scp=2&amp;sq=%22Javier+Gonzalez+Fraga%22&amp;st=nyt|title=Bank Holiday in Argentina As Currency Plunges 12.5%|publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=January 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
[[File:Alfonsín, González Fraga, Gil Lavedra y Bazze.jpg|thumb|240px|González Fraga in a conversation with (''from left'') Congressman [[Ricardo Gil Lavedra]], UCR presidential candidate [[Ricardo Alfonsín]], and Miguel Bazze of the Buenos Aires Province UCR during the [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 elections]].]]
González Fraga returned to the private sector. He was named Director of the Argentine Institute of Capital Markets, a [[think tank]] associated with the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamc.sba.com.ar/ |title=Instituto Argentino de Mercado de Capitales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later named Vice President of the Stock Exchange.&lt;ref name=konex/&gt; He remained active as a dairy farmer. He established a manufacturing plant at [http://www.lasalamandra.com.ar/ La Salamandra] in 1991, and introduced [[buffalo mozzarella]] to Argentina;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/203163-en-la-granja-la-salamandra-las-bufalas-son-buenas-anfitrionas|title=En la granja La Salamandra las búfalas son buenas anfitrionas|publisher=''La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Salamandra's [[dulce de leche]], a traditional Argentine confection, earned first place at the 2000 [[NASFT|Fancy Food Show of New York]].&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snazzygourmet.com/La_Salamandra_Dulce_de_Leche_p/ls-100.htm |title=La Salamandra Dulce de Leche |publisher=Snazzy Gourmet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324233450/http://www.snazzygourmet.com/La_Salamandra_Dulce_de_Leche_p/ls-100.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He also returned to academia, and was given tenure as Professor of Economics at his alma mater in 1994.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;  He earned a [[Konex Award]] for his role as an entrepreneur in 1998, and in 2004, was offered the post of Director of the National Arts Fund by President [[Néstor Kirchner]]; personal differences with actress [[Nacha Guevara]], a key Kirchner supporter, stymied the appointment, however.&lt;ref name=uno&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoreconquista.com/reconquista/El-economista-Javier-Gonzalez-Fraga-sera-el-candidato-a-vicepresidente-de-Alfonsin-20110603-0006.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324233448/http://www.unoreconquista.com/reconquista/El-economista-Javier-Gonzalez-Fraga-sera-el-candidato-a-vicepresidente-de-Alfonsin-20110603-0006.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-24 |title=El economista Javier González Fraga será el candidato a vicepresidente de Alfonsín |publisher=''Diario Uno'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; González Fraga became known as one of the nation's foremost experts and proponents of [[Keynesian economics]].&lt;ref name=cl07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/15/elpais/p-01001.htm|title=Javier González Fraga: "De Keynes, Kirchner sólo tiene la 'K' del apellido"|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would influence a number of future policy makers in Argentina, including [[Martín Lousteau]], with whom he wrote ''Sin Atajos'' (''"Without Shortcuts"'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Javier González Fraga|author2=Martín Lousteau|title=Sin atajos: de la ciclotimia a la madurez del desarrollo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRDAAAAYAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Temas Grupo Editorial|isbn=978-950-9445-12-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005,&lt;ref name=uno/&gt; and [[Débora Giorgi]], who worked with González Fraga during his tenure at the Central Bank.&lt;ref name=u24&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.com/noticias/val/9343/lavagna-senalo-a-gonzalez-fraga-un-vice-para-alfonsin-pensando-en-la-economia-.html |title=Lavagna señaló a González Fraga, un vice para Alfonsín pensando en la economía |publisher=''Urgente 24'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075828/http://www.urgente24.com/noticias/val/9343/lavagna-senalo-a-gonzalez-fraga-un-vice-para-alfonsin-pensando-en-la-economia-.html |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He himself, however, never garnered an appointment to the powerful Economy Ministry, despite having been frequently considered for the post.&lt;ref name=cl07/&gt; 

Close to important figures in both the center-left [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] and the center-right [[Federal Peronism]], González Fraga was entrusted by UCR presidential nominee [[Ricardo Alfonsín]] to offer former Economy Minister [[Roberto Lavagna]] the vice-presidential slot for the [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 elections]]; Lavagna reportedly instead persuaded González Fraga to run with Alfonsín, and on June 2, their UCR ticket was formally announced.&lt;ref name=u24/&gt; They placed third with 11% of the vote.

'''José Manuel Rodrigues Berardo''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Prince Henry|GCIH]], [[Order of Prince Henry|ComIH]]&lt;/small&gt;, best known as '''Joe Berardo''', is a Portuguese [[businessman]], [[stock investor]], [[speculator]], and [[art collector]]. According to Portuguese magazine ''[[Exame (Portuguese magazine)|Exame]]'', he had an estimated net worth of €598 million in 2010, making him one of the wealthiest people in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aeiou.expresso.pt/americo-amorim-e-o-mais-rico-de-portugal=f596561 Top ten richest people in Portugal] in Exame {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Berardo was born at Santa Luzia, [[Funchal]], [[Madeira]], Portugal. Berardo left school when he was 13 years old and got a low-ranked job in the winery sector of [[Madeira wine]]. At the age of 18, he emigrated to [[South Africa]] where he worked in horticulture distribution and eventually set up large commercial ventures, becoming at the end of the 20th century one of the most renowned and wealthiest Portuguese [[entrepreneur]]s. In South Africa, he created [[Egoli Consolidated Mines Ltd]], a [[gold extraction]] company. Initially, the gold extraction was performed using low-value waste lands that were apparently being ignored. Later, the mining company started to deal with [[diamond]] mining as well. Berardo returned to Portugal in 1986.&lt;ref name="DE"&gt;[https://diarioeconomico.sapo.pt/edicion/diarioeconomico/nacional/economia/pt/desarrollo/1006881.html Biography of José Berardo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703084518/http://diarioeconomico.sapo.pt/edicion/diarioeconomico/nacional/economia/pt/desarrollo/1006881.html |date=2007-07-03 }}, in Diário Económico {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock market==
As a very wealthy and active [[stock trader]], Berardo is a central personality on the Portuguese stock exchange, [[Euronext Lisbon]], where he trades large amounts of stock throughout the year, often having immediate [[capital gain]] as his only perceived goal. His businesses include [[hotels]], [[tobacco]], animal food, [[telecommunications]], [[banking]], and [[wine]]s. Berardo's estimated total wealth, including stock in large Portuguese banking and telecommunications companies, is over €1.9 billion.&lt;ref name="DE" /&gt;

===Long-term stockholding===
Berardo also has long-term investments in large companies, like [[Millennium BCP]] bank and [[Portugal Telecom]] (PT) telecommunications operator, which are both listed on the Euronext Lisbon. In 2006, he took a prominent part in the struggle against [[Sonae.com]]'s very publicized takeover bid over Portugal Telecom. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposing [[Belmiro de Azevedo]] (founder and historical chairman of [[Sonae]] holding company) and his son Paulo Azevedo (ex-head officer of [[Sonae.com]] telecommunications operator and actual chairman of [[Sonae]]) to the investor Berardo and PT's administrators [[Zeinal Bava]] and Henrique Granadeiro, failed.&lt;ref name="DE"/&gt;

===S.L. Benfica - Futebol, S.A.D. share bid===
In June 2007, Berardo made a bid for 60% of [[S.L. Benfica|Sport Lisboa e Benfica]] - Futebol, [[Sociedade Anónima Desportiva|S.A.D.]]'s shares at €3.50 a share,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duarte|first=Pedro|date=15 June 2007|title=Joe Berardo lança OPA para controlar Benfica|trans-title=Joe Berardo launches takeover bid to control Benfica|url=https://economico.sapo.pt/edicion/diarioeconomico/nacional/empresas/pt/desarrollo/1006204.html|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|newspaper=Diário Económico|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602112814/http://economico.sapo.pt/edicion/diarioeconomico/nacional/empresas/pt/desarrollo/1006204.html|archive-date=2 June 2013|access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duarte|first=Pedro|date=15 June 2013|title=OPA incide sobre 60% do capital da SAD do Benfica|trans-title=Takeover bid focuses on 60% of Benfica SAD's capital|url=https://economico.sapo.pt/edicion/diarioeconomico/nacional/empresas/pt/desarrollo/1006165.html|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|newspaper=Diário Económico|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225184515/http://economico.sapo.pt/edicion/diarioeconomico/nacional/empresas/pt/desarrollo/1006165.html|archive-date=25 December 2013|access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 30% premium to the recent share price. But the price was well below the €5 a share set at Benfica's [[Initial public offering|IPO]] in May 2007, when after an initial flurry of optimism the shares fell steadily to below €3 apiece, hammered hard by the team's fourth-place finish in the [[Portuguese Liga]] and the failure to make any great gains in [[UEFA Champions League|European competition]]. Berardo's bid was not hostile, as reports said the Benfica management had been informed in advance and was generally in favor of the offer. Overall, the bid was worth some €31.5 million and was conditional on Berardo netting 50% of the company plus one share, to ensure control. The bid valued S.L. Benfica - Futebol, S.A.D. at €52.5 million. However, Berardo did not exclude a major stake in the Futebol, S.A.D., which could have been achieved within the 33% [[free float]] of publicly traded stock that was issued in the stock market in May 2007. Berardo, who is a paying member of S.L. Benfica (''sócio'') and a declared [[Supporters of S.L. Benfica|supporter of the club]], failed to become the largest individual stockholder in the club's S.A.D., since only about 1% of the intended stock was sold to him as of the 20 August 2007 deadline.

==Club Sport Marítimo==
After his failed attempt to bid on Benfica, Berardo refocused his attention on his hometown club [[C.S. Marítimo|Club Sport Marítimo]], of which has also declared his support for and is a registered member also. On 17 November 2007, during the club's 97th anniversary celebration, he was honoured with a silver medal to commemorate his 25 years as a Marítimo member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.record.pt/noticia.asp?id=765029&amp;idCanal=20 ''Berardo vai receber medalha de 25 anos de sócio''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118014326/http://www.record.pt/noticia.asp?id=765029&amp;idCanal=20 |date=2007-11-18 }}, article in Jornal Record, November 17, 2007 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the occasion to announce his interest in the clubs' new stadium plans, the [[Estádio do Marítimo]], and offer his aid as a "supporter with passion" for the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.record.pt/noticia.asp?id=765241&amp;idCanal=20 ''Berardo quer ajudar''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120141703/http://www.record.pt/noticia.asp?id=765241&amp;idCanal=20 |date=2007-11-20 }}, article in Jornal Record, November 19, 2007 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==
Berardo has a special interest for [[modern art]], being one of the most successful contemporary [[art collector]]s in Portugal. An inveterate collector, he started as a schoolboy with stamps, postcards and matchboxes and graduated to modern and contemporary art in the 1980s. His various collections, which include art deco and Chinese porcelain, encompass more than 40,000 works, of which some 1,200 are by well-known modern and contemporary artists with a reported value of $750 million.&lt;ref name="Gleadell" /&gt; Much of his art collection has in the past been used as collateral to borrow from banks.&lt;ref name="Gleadell"&gt;Colin Gleadel (September 13, 2010), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/8000553/Jose-Berardo-interview-for-Vilamoura-sculpture-park-in-the-Algarve.html# Jose Berardo interview for Vilamoura sculpture park in the Algarve] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berardo went public with his collection in 1997, displaying works at an old casino in Sintra, and then at the white stone fortress-like [[Centro Cultural de Belém]], in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="Gleadell"/&gt; By agreement with the [[Portuguese Government]], a [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] (''Fundação de Arte Moderna e Contemporânea—Colecção Berardo'') was created to support the housing of his art collection of roughly 1,800 works&lt;ref name="Sherwood"&gt;Seth Sherwood (February 18, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/arts/19iht-sclisbon19.html In Lisbon, Sowing the Seeds of Culture] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Centro Cultural de Belém.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dre.pt/gratis/diplomas/diplomas1s.asp |title=The foundation was created by Decree-Law 164/2006 of 9 August |accessdate=2010-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011010622/http://www.dre.pt/gratis/diplomas/diplomas1s.asp |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }} (from the Ministry of Culture) accessible from the search engine for the ''[[Diário da República]]'', the Portuguese Government's official gazette. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as the Spanish state did with the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] in Madrid,&lt;ref name="Gleadell"/&gt; the government agreed to house part of his collection and took a 10-year option to buy 862 paintings and sculptures for 316 million euros, based on a [[Christie's]] valuation in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Silver and Anabela Reis (February 3, 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aIxF2nwtfmxE Billionaire Whistle-Blower Loses $730 Million Alleging Fraud] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museu Colecção Berardo]] was inaugurated on June 25, 2007.

'''John Robert Beyster''' (July 26, 1924 – December 22, 2014), often styled '''J. Robert Beyster''', was the founder of [[Science Applications International Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. J. Robert Beyster with [[Peter Economy]], The SAIC Solution: How We Built an $8 Billion Employee-Owned Technology Company, John Wiley &amp; Sons (2007) p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; He was Chairman of the Board until his retirement in July 2004,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/business/j-robert-beyster-scientist-and-entrepreneur-is-dead-at-90.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; and also served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) until November 2003. A recognized authority on [[national security]] and [[nuclear reactor physics]], Beyster committed 35 years of his life to building SAIC on the founding tenets of [[employee ownership]] and technical excellence. In recent years, he extended this commitment to the American business community by founding two nonprofit organizations to assist organizations considering employee ownership—the [[Beyster Institute]] and the Foundation for Enterprise Development.

Beyster was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]], in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2014/12/23/saic-founder-j-robert-beyster-dies/?single_page=true&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Grosse Ile, Michigan]]. He attended school at Slocum Truax High School in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and was [[salutatorian]] of his graduating class. As he was preparing to graduate from high school, the United States entered [[World War II]], and he enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]]. He was sent to college at the [[University of Michigan]], where he was enrolled in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V12 Officer Training Program]]. He was commissioned as an ensign, and eventually served on a destroyer based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] before leaving the service six months later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2014/12/22/eight-bells-dr-j-robert-beyster/&lt;/ref&gt; Educated at the [[University of Michigan]] (COE: BSE, MS, PhD),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/dec/22/beyster-saic-dies/&lt;/ref&gt; Beyster worked as a scientist for [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] Atomic Power Division on the company’s nuclear submarine program in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.federalnewsradio.com/130/3768420/SAIC-Leidos-founder-dead-at-90&lt;/ref&gt; He soon followed many of his college associates to [[New Mexico]] to work as a research [[physics|physicist]] at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=20141223cza&amp;_t=SAIC+founder+J+Robert+Beyster+dies+at+age+90#.VJms1sDhA&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957 he became the chairman of the Accelerator Physics Department of [[General Atomics]] where he remained until it was bought by [[Gulf Oil]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leidos.com/feature/the-solutions-man&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Beyster raised money to start Science Applications, Inc. (SAI) by investing the proceeds from selling stock he had received from General Atomic, combined with funds raised from the early employees who bought stock in the young enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/dec/22/beyster-saic-dies/&lt;/ref&gt; The company was renamed Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as it expanded its operations. Initially the company’s focus was on projects for the U.S. government related to nuclear power and weapons effects study programs. Contrary to traditional business models, Beyster designed SAIC so that ownership of the company and profits belonged to the company’s employees. This shared ownership was accompanied by shared responsibility and freedom in business development. SAIC attracted and retained highly educated (most with PhDs or master's degrees) and motivated entrepreneurs that helped the company to grow and diversify. Today, SAIC, now named [[Leidos]], performs projects for commercial and government customers related to information technology, systems integration and eSolutions, national and homeland security, energy, the environment, space, telecommunications, health care, and logistics. When Beyster retired as Chairman of SAIC on July 16, 2004, the company had annual revenues of $6.7 billion and more than 43,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/business/j-robert-beyster-scientist-and-entrepreneur-is-dead-at-90.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyster founded the Foundation for Enterprise Development in 1986&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leidos.com/feature/the-solutions-man&lt;/ref&gt; "to help develop successful enterprises in the U.S. and around the world" by focusing on "advancing entrepreneurship and employee ownership through its work with technologists, entrepreneurs, executives, governments, and educators." In 2004, the Foundation launched the [[Beyster Institute]], which is "dedicated to training, education, and consulting in employee ownership and entrepreneurship."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leidos.com/feature/the-solutions-man&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyster wrote or co-authored approximately 60 publications and reports, as well as the books, The SAIC Solution: How We Built an $8 Billion Employee-Owned Technology Company, published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glass|first1=jon w.|title=SAIC creator's book touts employee ownership|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/245611|accessdate=27 November 2014|agency=The Virginian-Pilot|date=April 3, 2007|quote=Beyster, 82, retired as SAIC's chairman in July 2004. A nuclear physicist by training and a self-described "evangelist" for employee-owned companies, Beyster said he wrote the book to provide entrepreneurs and business executives a model. He wrote it with Peter Economy, an author or co-author of more than 75 business books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Names, Numbers, and Network Solutions: The Monetization of the Internet, cowritten with Michael A. Daniels and published in 2013. A fellow of the [[American Nuclear Society]], Beyster has served as Chairman of its Reactor Physics Division and Shielding Division. He was a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], a member of the Scientific Advisory Group to the Director, Strategic Target Planning Staff of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]]. He also served as Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Directors of the [[University of California, San Diego]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leidos.com/feature/the-solutions-man&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency]] designated Beyster an Honorary Program Manager for his distinguished contributions to the agency over his career. He also received the Engineering Manager of the Year Award in 2000 from the American Society of Engineering Management, the 2001 Spirit of San Diego Award from the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Lifetime Achievement Award from [[Ernst &amp; Young]] in 2003, and the “Supporter of Entrepreneurialism” award from Arthur Young and Venture magazine — at their Entrepreneur of the Year awards ceremony — for his efforts to support and promote entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leidos.com/feature/the-solutions-man&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC) recognized Beyster with the Herb Klein Civic Leadership Award for his outstanding leadership in addressing regional challenges through collaboration with public, private, and civic partners. Beyster is the recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the University of California, San Diego’s CONNECT program for providing 25 years of outstanding service to the community. The [[Horatio Alger Association for Distinguished Americans]] selected Beyster to be a 2008 Horatio Alger Award recipient. This honor is bestowed upon those individuals who have overcome adversity to achieve great successes through the American free enterprise system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leidos.com/feature/the-solutions-man&lt;/ref&gt;

A former naval man, Beyster enjoyed sailing and was the owner of ''Solutions'', a Hinckley motor yacht. While Beyster was still at SAIC, the company backed and provided critical design technology to a number of U.S entries in the [[America's Cup]] race.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/dec/22/beyster-saic-dies/&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, April 11, 2012, the computer science engineering building at the University of Michigan was rededicated in his name as the Bob and Betty Beyster Building. 
Bob and Betty Beyster married at St. Alban’s Church in Austin, Texas in 1955 and have three adult children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beyster.com/blog/?p=174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Beyster was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyster died at his home in La Jolla, California on December 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/dec/22/beyster-saic-dies/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juliusz Karol Kunitzer''' ({{lang-de|Julius Kunitzer}}) (1843–1905) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-German industrialist, economic activist, philanthropist, one of the industrial magnates of [[Łódź]] ([[Congress Poland]]/[[Vistula Land]]). He owned a textile and later a joint stock company. His viciousness towards workers and cooperation with Russian authorities gained him notoriety among Łódż citizens. He was assassinated by [[Polish Socialist Party]] activists in the aftermath of the [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905 Łódź insurrection]].

Kunitzer was a polarizing personality and career. Known among Łódź's elites as a shrewd businessman, "cotton king" who became a tycoon due to his personal skills and luck, respected for this and his philanthropy and other public initiatives, for others – particularly radicals and socialists, he was a vicious exploiter of workers and a leader of anti-labor industrialists.&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{pl icon}} ''[http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/panorama/49211,kunitzer-krol-widzewa,id,t.html?cookie=1 Kunitzer – król Widzewa]'', Dziennik Łódzki, 26 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Bronisław Wilkoszewski – Pałac J. Kunitzera.jpg|thumb|Kunitzer's villa, ul. Spacerowa 15, Łódź]]
Kunitzer was born on 19 September 1843 in the [[Przedbórz|Pohulanka]] village, in Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland]] (increasingly known as the [[Vistula Land]]).&lt;ref name=lodzapgov&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.lodz.ap.gov.pl/fab6.html JULIUSZ KAROL KUNITZER]&lt;/ref&gt; His family had roots in German burgher society, and moved to the Polish territories in the 1830s&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Kunitzer described himself as a Pole, including during a public speech to Russian businessmen in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] which caused a brief sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Polacy-Niemcy-Żydzi w Łodzi w XIX-XX w:sąsiedzi dalecy i bliscy Paweł Samuś,page 224 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilustrowana
encyklopedia historii łodzi, Urząd Miasta Łodzi, nr IV / 1, page 198 [http://www.uml.lodz.pl/get.php?id=835]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Jakub, a [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]] by profession, died in 1850, after which Juliusz with his mother moved to [[Tyniec]].&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Young Kunitzer became a weaver, following his father's footsteps.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;

He came to [[Łódź]] in 1855.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He joined the E. Hentschl's factory, quickly advancing to a managerial position.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; In 1869 he married Agnieszka Meyer, sister of the industrialist [[Ludwik Meyer]].&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Using his wife's [[dowry]], he invested in a construction of a new factory, which begun operations in the following year.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; In partnership with Ludwik Meyer, in 1874, he bought the Hentschl's factory, damaged by the fire, and operated the "Kunitzer i Meyer" company.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; In 1879 he withdrew from that partnership, built cotton industry in the village of [[Widzew]] near Łódź, and begun a different one with [[Theodor Julius Heinzel]].&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Over the next few decades his factory complex expanded, with a dedicated railway line, worker's housing (150 homes), a hospital, a school, church, shops, and other buildings, which saw Widzew transformed from rural village to a [[quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]] of Łódź.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; [[File:Ul. Niciarniana w Łodzi - widok z parku 01.jpg|thumb|Heinzel &amp; Kunitzer factory, Łódź-Widzew (2011)]]
Kunitzer was also involved in setting up an [[electric railway]] (the Koleje Elektryczne Łódzke S.A. and Łódzkie Wąskotorowe Elektryczne Koleje Dojazdowe S.A. stock companies) and in coal import company (Konsorcjum Węglowe "Kunitzer et Co.").&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He was a member of the board of many organizations (such as the [[Bank Handlowy]]).&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He also had investments outside Polish territories, for example in Russia, where he was involved in the iron mining and steelworking.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He was also involved in philanthropy, and presided for many years over the Łódzkie Chrześcijańskie Towarzystwo Dobroczynności (Łódź Christian Society of Goodwill).&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;

He was hated by the workers in Łódż, due to his particularly vicious treatment of employees in his factories, and due to fact that he remained in close contact and cooperated with Russian authorities&lt;ref&gt;Niepodległość, Volume 17, Instytut Badania Najnowszej Historji Polski (Warsaw, Poland), Instytut Józefa Piłsudskiego Poświęcony Badaniu Najnowszej Historii Polski (London, England), page 185,Pilsudski Institute of America, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Kunitzer often denied his workers their salaries in order to "teach them reason" which threatened them with hunger; such threat was also used to break down strike at his factory.&lt;ref&gt;Bolesław Leśmian, ''Recepta na miliony'', Książka i Wiedza, 1967, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in his factory faced financial fines and payments&lt;ref&gt;''Miasta polskie w tysiącleciu'', Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1965, Tom 2, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 report by Russian authorities pointed out that Kunitzer's factory which employed 860 workers, had no first aid room where a doctor could help or examine an injured worker.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocznik łódzki'', 1977, Volume 22, Polskie Towarzystwo Historyczne. Oddział Łódzki Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; Kunitzer's factories were also among two with lowest wages in Łódż and there was already a failed attempt to assassinate him in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paweł Samuś|title="Bunt łódzki" 1892 roku: studia z dziejów wielkiego konfliktu społecznego|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi_tAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=1993|publisher=Wydawn.

[[File:Juliusz Kunitzer grob.JPG|thumb|180px|Kunitzer's mausoleum at the Old Cemetery of Łódź]]
On 30 September 1905 he was assassinated by [[Polish Socialist Party]] activists in the aftermath of the [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905 Łódź insurrection]] in which he refused any concessions to the workers.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Pytlas, 1994, ''Łódzka burżuazja przemysłowa w latach 1864–1914'', Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; One of the assailants (Adolf Szulc) was captured; the second one escaped.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; The assailant confessed that hundreds of poverty stricken workers who were victims of Kunitzer were his motivation for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Wacław Pawlak, ''Na łódzkim bruku, 1901–1918'', 1986, Wydawnictwo Lódzkie, page 68&lt;/ref&gt; His assassination became the topic of the day for Polish and Russian newspapers; the event was condemned by conservative media, and praised by the radical, socialist ones.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; His funeral on 3 October that year gathered thousands of people.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; He was buried at the [[Stary Cmentarz]] at Ogrodowa street, and his grave was marked by a simple, black tombstone.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt;

In 1906 Heinzel &amp; Kunitzer employed 3,343 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas: Land der grossen Ströme|first1= Joachim |last1=Rogall |publisher=Siedler|year=1996|isbn=3-88680-204-3|page=313|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Widzew enterprise was bought by Heinzel and Italians Tanfani and Farinola.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;

==Personal life==
Berfield was born in [[Agoura Hills, California]], the son of Gail Berfield (née Stark) and Eric "Rick" Berfield. He is the younger brother of actor Lorne Berfield. Berfield is [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/from_middle_to_the_top_20010824/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401202928/http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/from_middle_to_the_top_20010824|archive-date=April 1, 2009|title=From Middle to the Top – Arts|work=Jewish Journal|date=August 23, 2001|author=Naomi Pfefferman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bought and then later sold the house previously owned by ''[[Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica]]'' stars [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Nick Lachey]].

==Acting career==
Berfield's first screen appearance was in a [[Folgers]] coffee commercial at age five. He went on to appear in 20 other nationally broadcast American commercials as a young child. His TV debut came in the short-lived series ''[[The Good Life (1994 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' (1994) in which he co-starred with [[Drew Carey]]. More TV appearances followed in ''[[Hardball (1994 TV series)|Hardball]]'', ''[[The Boys Are Back (TV series)|The Boys Are Back]]'', ''[[The Mommies (TV series)|The Mommies]]'' (1994–1995).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His first long-running TV role was as Ross Malloy in ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'' (1995–1999), in which he notched up 100 episode appearances. Beginning in 2000 he gained international prominence with his role as Malcolm's trouble-making older brother Reese in ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''. He appeared in all 151 episodes of that series, and with the recording of the 100th episode became the youngest actor in screen history to have appeared in 100 episodes of two different TV series. Since the conclusion of ''Malcolm in the Middle'' in 2006, Berfield has concentrated on production work, although he made a one-off appearance in the series ''[[Sons of Tucson]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0073678/bio Justin Berfield biography], imdb.com; accessed September 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been active with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and most recently [[Virgin Unite]], the charitable arm of [[Virgin Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://officialjustinberfield.com/support.html Justin Berfield – I Support], officialjustinberfield.com; accessed September 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural history]] specimen dealers had an important role in the development of science in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. They supplied the rapidly growing, both in size and number, museums and educational establishments and private collectors whose collections, either in entirety or parts finally entered [[List of natural history museums|museums]].
Most sold not just [[Zoological specimen|zoological]], [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geology|geological]] specimens but also 
equipment and books. Many also sold [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] items.They purchased 
specimens from professional and amateur collectors, sometimes collected themselves as well as acting as agents for the sale of 
collections. Many were based in [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] centres notably [[Amsterdam]], [[Hamburg]], and [[London]] or 
in major cities. Some were specialists and some were [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] authorities who wrote scientific works and manuals, some functioned as trading museums or institutes.

'''Lucien Barrière''' (14 January 1923 – 17 September 1990) was a French entrepreneur and [[businessman]]. He was the heir and founder of the [[Lucien Barrière group]], one of the largest group of casinos, luxury hotels, resorts and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challenges.fr/entreprise/20130606.CHA0316/bluffant-dominique-desseigne-pdg-de-groupe-lucien-barriere.html|title=Bluffant - Dominique Desseigne, PDG de Groupe Lucien Barrière|work=Challenges|date=June 7, 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in the French Ardèche region from a modest, goat raising family.

In 1962, he was chosen by his uncle François André, who had no direct descendants, to succeed him as head of several successful companies specializing in the operation of [[casino]]s and luxury hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcbourse.com/apprendre/biographie_lucien_barriere-98|title=Lucien Barriere|work=ABC Bourse|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casinos of [[Deauville]], [[Cannes]] and [[La Baule]] and the hotels Normandy Barriere, Royal Barriere and the Hotel du Golf Barriere de Deauville were among the best known assets of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normandie-tourisme.fr/Hotel-du-Golf-Barriere/HOT/SAINT-ARNOULT/fiche-HOTNOR014FS001S9-2.html|title=Hotel du Golf Barrière|work=Normandy Tourism|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, he became the general manager of the group. For thirty years he developed the successful Barriere empire following the same policy as his predecessor: luxury, sophistication, perfection, elegance, refinement, friendliness and cultivating the French [[joie de vivre]].

He married Martha Szentgyörgyi (died October 11, 2008), a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] dancer. Martha had a daughter from a previous marriage, Diane, born in 1957, which he adopted and raised as his own. He taught her the know-how of the trade, before designating her as the sole heir of his luxury empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Economie/Dominique-Desseigne-se-devoile-pour-Paris-Match-et-parle-de-ses-relations-avec-Rachida-Dati-136419|title=Dominique Desseigne se dévoile pour PAris Match et parle de ses relations avec Rachida Dati|work=Paris Match|date=October 2, 2012|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, he founded the [[Lucien Barrière group]], one of the first French companies charged with managing casinos and luxury hotels.

In 1975, Lucien Barrière sponsored the creation of the [[American Film Festival]] in Deauville, alongside the major proponents of this idea, the Mayor of Deauville [[Michel d'Ornano]], André Halimi and Lionel Shushan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confidentielles.com/r_13496_le-parcours-de-lucien-barriere.htm|title=Le parcours de Lucien Barrière|work=Confidentielles|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, he died at Caen University Hospital of cardiac arrest at the age of 67, following complications resulting from a [[coronary angioplasty]] carried out by Professor Grollier. Diane, married to the notary Dominique Desseigne, succeeded her adoptive father as head of the group and pursued the same successful policy as her predecessors. In July 1995 she was the victim of a serious plane crash that left her [[quadriplegic]], and later died in May 2001 at 44 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellocoton.fr/to/PaP#http://www.purepeople.com/article/mort-de-martha-barriere-du-groupe-barriere_a17126/1|title=Mort de MArtha Barrière, du groupe Barrière...|work=Pure People|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labandearuquier.com/Hommage-a-Martha-Barriere-l-amie.html|title=Hommage à Martha Barrière, l'ami de Steevy|work=La bande à Ruquier|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market Driven Quality''' (MDQ) is a term currently espoused by Donna Prestwood and Paul Schumann, but which has been around since the early 1980s.  IBM used MDQ as their slogan for the [[IBM PCjr]] and [[OS/2]].  MDQ is defined as letting the market, meaning the price, determine the quality standards a business applies to its products.  The term has gone out of favor somewhat, due to Wal-Mart's approach to MDQ.  Wal-Mart doesn't use the term "MDQ" but applies the principle rigidly to its vendors.

Certainly MDQ has its place.  We would not have commodity pricing on PCs if not for MDQ.  And, on the other hand, if a business is seeking an upscale market then MDQ provides justification for high prices for high quality.  Certainly [[Alienware]] thrives whereas the PC Jr died.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Ohlson O-Score for predicting bankruptcy''' is a multi-factor financial formula postulated in 1980 by Dr. [[James Ohlson]] of the [[New York University]] Stern Accounting Department as an alternative to the [[Altman Z-score]] for predicting financial distress.&lt;ref name="ycharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/ohlson_score|title=Ohlson's O-Score Definition|website=ycharts.com|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of the O-Score==
The Ohlson O-Score is the result of a 9-factor linear combination of [[coefficient]]-weighted business ratios which are readily obtained or derived from the standard periodic financial disclosure statements provided by publicly traded corporations.  Two of the factors utilized are widely considered to be dummies as their value and thus their impact upon the formula typically is 0.&lt;ref name="stockopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockopedia.com/content/improving-on-the-altman-z-score-part-2-the-ohlson-o-score-70800/|title=Improving On The Altman Z-Score, Part 2: The Ohlson O-Score | first = Jonathan | last = Stokes | date = 13 February 2013 | website=stockopedia.com|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When using an O-Score to evaluate the probability of company’s failure, then exp(O-Score) is divided by 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;exp(O-score).&lt;ref name="fdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/2008/jan/CFR_SS_2008_KarlynMitchell.pdf|date=7 January 2008|title=Bankers on Boards, Financial Constraints, and Financial Distress (''Preliminary and incomplete. Please do not quote.'')| first1 = Karlyn | last1 = Mitchell | first2 = Mark D. | last2 = Walker|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculation for Ohlson’s O-Score appears below:&lt;ref name="JStor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~ismt551/project2/Ohlson.pdf|title=Financial Ratios and the Probabilistic Prediction of Bankruptcy|author=James A. Ohlson|accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T = {} &amp; -1.32 - 0.407\log(TA_t/GNP) + 6.03\frac{TL_t}{TA_t} - 1.43\frac{WC_t}{TA_t} + 0.0757\frac{CL_t}{CA_t} \\[10pt]
&amp; {} - 1.72 X - 2.37\frac{NI_t}{TA_t} - 1.83\frac{FFO_t}{TL_t} + 0.285Y - 0.521\frac{NI_t-NI_{t-1}}{|NI_t| + |NI_{t-1}|}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''TA'' = [[total assets]]
* ''GNP'' = [[Gross National Product price index level]]
* ''TL'' = [[total liabilities]]
* ''WC'' = [[working capital]]
* ''CL'' = current liabilities
* ''CA'' = [[current assets]]
* ''X'' = 1 if ''TL'' &gt; ''TA'', 0 otherwise
* ''NI'' = [[net income]]
* ''FFO'' = funds from operations
* ''Y'' = 1 if a [[net loss]] for the last two years, 0 otherwise

==Interpretation==

The original model for the O-Score was derived from the study of a pool of just over 2000 companies, whereas by comparison its predecessor the Altman Z-Score considered just 66 companies. As a result, the O-Score is significantly more accurate a predictor of bankruptcy within a 2-year period. The original Z-Score was estimated to be over 70% accurate with its later variants reaching as high as 90% accuracy. The O-Score is more accurate than this.

However, no mathematical model is 100% accurate, so while the O-Score may forecast bankruptcy or solvency, factors both inside and outside of the formula can impact its accuracy. Furthermore, later [[bankruptcy prediction]] models such as the hazard based model proposed by Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi in 2011&lt;ref name="citeseerx"&gt;{{cite paper | citeseerx = 10.1.1.233.2093 | title = Predicting financial distress and the performance of distressed stocks | first1 = John Y. | last1 = Campbell | first2 = Jens | last2 = Hilscher | first3 = Jan | last3 = Szilagyi }}&lt;/ref&gt; have proven more accurate still. For the O-Score, any results larger than 0.5 suggests that the firm will default within two years.

'''Retailtainment''' is [[retail]] marketing as [[entertainment]]. In his book, ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption'' (1999), author [[George Ritzer]] describes "retailtainment" as the "use of ambience, emotion, sound and activity to get customers interested in the merchandise and in a mood to buy."&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George, ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes called "inspirational retailing" or "entertailing,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babsoninsight.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/703 Babson Insight: Fun is Serious Business—Particularly for Mature “Neutral” Service Firms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been defined as "the modern trend of combining shopping and entertainment opportunities as an anchor for customers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skoupy.net/pdf/research_on_retailing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Codeluppi described it as a way for marketers to "offer the consumer physical and emotional sensations during the shopping experience." And, in an article entitled "Using sonic branding in the retail environment" in the 2003 issue of the ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', Fulberg described it as a way for retailers to entertain the consumer with a dramatization of their values."

According to Michael Morrison at the Australian Centre for Retail Studies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“There is a move towards the concept of 'retailtainment.' This phenomenon, which brings together retailing, entertainment, music and leisure ... Retailers need to look further than the traditional retail store elements such as colour, lighting and visual merchandising to influence buying decisions. The specific atmosphere the retailer creates can, in some cases, be more influential in the decision-making process than the product itself. As goods and services become more of a commodity, it is what a shopper experiences and what atmosphere retailers create that really matters. Brand building is a combination of physical, functional, operational and psychological elements. Consumers will be willing to pay more for a brand if there is a perceived or actual added value from their experience of using the product or service.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/12/0c01e712.asp A touch of the theatre to add the ‘wow’ factor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shopper marketing expert Simon Temperley of Los Angeles agency [[The Marketing Arm]], formerly U.S. Marketing &amp; Promotions (Usmp), describes "retailtainment" as a "live brand experience" that frequently includes the use of "brand ambassadors" who "converse with the consumer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://promomagazine.com/mag/marketing_hired_fans/ Hired Fans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Keith Leavitt''' (1895–1967) was a [[Harvard University|Harvard-educated]] [[New York City]] advertising [[copywriter]] who turned to non-fiction writing. He was the author of many books, including a history of ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' and "The Chip on Grandma's Shoulder" (1954.) 'Bob' Leavitt was also the longtime historian of the original [[The Baker Street Irregulars]], devoted to all things [[Sherlock Holmes|Holmesian]], about which he wrote in his "[[221B Baker Street|The Origins of 221B Worship]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9LGvL2WcXX0C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt'&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fmkaQTGijb&amp;sig=-H8bjQitdBAvHO2F8CRsxatErtw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result ''The Origin of 221B Worship, Sherlock Holmes by Gas-lamp: Highlights from the First Four Decades of the Baker Street Journal'', Philip A. Shreffler, Fordham University Press, 1989] {{ISBN|0-8232-1221-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-8232-1221-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Leavitt was born on August 20, 1895 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to Dr. [[Robert Greenleaf Leavitt]], a Harvard-trained [[botanist]], researcher, author and later college and high school teacher, and his wife Janet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j78nAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr=#PPA37,M1 Secretary's Report, Harvard College Class of 1889, No. IV, Edward W. Wheeler, Cambridge, Mass., 1901]&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed "the fiscal Holmes" by another member of the Baker Street Irregulars,&lt;ref&gt;Irregular Records of the Early 'forties: An Archival History of the Baker Street Irregulars, page 22, January 1941-March 1944, Jon L. Lellenberg, Edgar Wadsworth Smith, Baker Street Irregulars, Jon L. Lellenberg, Edgar Wadsworth Smith, Published by Baker Street Irregulars, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Keith Leavitt showed an early aptitude for ferreting out information. He attended the State Model School in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], where his father was teaching, and graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1917. Shortly afterwards, Leavitt joined the armed forces as [[2nd Lieutenant]] in the 302nd Infantry, where he commanded the [[Prisoners of War]] Escort Company 223, with custody of 425 [[Germany|German]] prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-78nAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr= Thirtieth Anniversary, Harvard College Class of 1889, Eighth Report of the Class Secretary, June 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Leavitt returned home, and found work writing copy for a [[New York City]] [[advertising agency]]. He spent 13 years in advertising, including a stint as Secretary-Treasurer of the [[Association of National Advertisers]], before turning to a career as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] writer. From the beginning Leavitt focused on historical, offbeat subjects. He wrote for a range of publications, including a 1933 article for ''Business Week'' &amp;ndash; during the height of the Depression &amp;ndash; on'' What we shall sell when the upturn comes &amp;ndash; and to whom?'' &lt;ref&gt;''Business Week'' magazine, 1933, page 27, McGraw Hill, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt sold articles to many publications, including ''Forum and Century'', ''Advertising and Selling'', ''The American Magazine'', ''Forbes'' and others. In 1946 he wrote a 66-page booklet entitled ''Your Pay Envelope &amp;ndash; and how it gets that way''. To make ends meet, Leavitt wrote corporate histories, including that of the [[Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company]], and he wrote for publications of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]. The former copywriter also continued to dabble in advertising and [[public relations]].

The corporate biographies Leavitt wrote to garner a paycheck included titles like ''Prologue to Tomorrow: A History of the First Hundred Years in the Life of the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company'' (1950); ''Goods Roads'' about the [[General Motors]] Overseas operations (1949);  ''Foundation for the Future: History of the Stanley Works''  for [[Stanley Tools]] (1951); and 1954's ''Life at Tung-Sol 1904&amp;ndash;1954: An Informal Story of the First Half-century of Tung-Sol Electric Inc.'' Leavitt also found time to produce books on lighter subjects, notably ''The Chip on Grandma's Shoulder'', a memoir about his [[Maine]] grandmother Susan C. (Blazo) Keith,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoughtonhistory.com/letter1.htm A Letter from East Stoughton, Stoughton Historical Society, stoughtonhistory.com]&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|J. B. Lippincott]] in 1954, and ''Common Sense About Fund Raising'' (Stratford Press, 1949).

But the book for which Leavitt is remembered is ''Noah's Ark, New England Yankees, and the Endless Quest: A Short History of the Original Webster Dictionaries, with Particular Reference to Their First Hundred Years as Publications of G. &amp; C. Merriam Company''. Although a corporate history—published by [[G. &amp; C. Merriam Company]] of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1947 -- ''Noah's Ark'' explores the history of [[Noah Webster]] and his competitor [[Joseph Emerson Worcester]]. The book's first half examines Webster's life and [[lexicography]]; the second half etches the "War of the Dictionaries", the struggle for supremacy between Webster's and his competitor Worcester's dictionaries. Leavitt laid out the history of Webster's publishing house after its eponymous title was sold to the Merriam family (today's [[Merriam-Webster]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIRCsrMwhroC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr= ''Noah Webster and the American Dictionary'', David Micklethwait, Published by McFarland, 2005] {{ISBN|0-7864-2157-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2157-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Noah's Ark''  Leavitt plumbed the shoals of international [[lexicography]] and usage. "In considering the influence of Webster's American Dictionary outside the United States", writes David Micklethwait in ''Noah Webster and the American Dictionary'', "Leavitt says that Webster was 'increasingly the arbiter of definitions in British life', until the appearance of [[John Ogilvie (lexicographer)|John Ogilvie]]'s ''[[Imperial Dictionary of the English Language|Imperial Dictionary]]'' in 1850, 'itself largely indebted to the American source.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIRCsrMwhroC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr=#PPA272,M1 Noah Webster and the American Dictionary, David Micklethwait, Published by McFarland, 2005] {{ISBN|0-7864-2157-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2157-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt's work remains the definitive history of Noah Webster and his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eZaFF4XYh8UC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Robert+Keith+Leavitt+-inauthor:%22Robert+Keith+Leavitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=9oo0SbWPPJWekwTo19SJBA#PPA249,M1 After the Revolution: Profiles of Early American Culture, Joseph J. Ellis, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2002] {{ISBN|0-393-32233-5}} {{ISBN|978-0-393-32233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not writing articles and books, Leavitt indulged his passion for [[Sherlock Holmes]], helping found, with his friend [[Christopher Morley]], [[The Baker Street Irregulars]], an informal group of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] devotees. Records do not reflect when the author's affinity for [[Sherlock Holmes]] began, but his works show he was a close reader of Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RsQIjpXdDEgC&amp;pg=PA25-IA2&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr=#PPA25-IA2,M1 Robert Keith Leavitt in Morley's Studio, Photo, The Standard Doyle Company: Christopher Morley on Sherlock Holmes, Christopher Morley, Steven Rothman, Fordham University Press, 1990] {{ISBN|0-8232-1292-0}} {{ISBN|978-0-8232-1292-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Leavitt's writings as historian of the Irregulars that he seemed most at home, his imagination prowling [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s intricate plots, sniffing for clues about the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born author and his fictional sleuth. In an article entitled ''Annie Oakley in Baker Street'', for instance, Leavitt examined [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s choice of handgun: Leavitt theorized from Doyle's description that Holmes's sidearm was a [[Webley &amp; Scott|Webley]] Metropolitan Police Model, with 2½-inch barrel &amp;ndash; the smallest [[handgun]] available, and subject to concealment without a holster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwMAtOJhHHYC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr= ''Ms. Holmes of Baker Street: The Truth about Sherlock'', C. Alan Bradley, William Antony S. Sarjeant, University of Alberta, 2004] {{ISBN|0-88864-415-9}} {{ISBN|978-0-88864-415-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voracious Leavitt mined Holmes's adventures for [[monograph]]s of his own. He authored ''The Curious Matter of the Anonymous Latin Epitaph'', ''The Cardboard Box'' and others. In an essay in ''[[The Baker Street Journal]]'', the Baker Street Irregulars's periodical,&lt;ref&gt;The Baker Street Irregulars began publishing ''The Baker Street Journal'', "an irregular quarterly of Sherlockiana", in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt thought fit to question the marksmanship of the revered detective. In ''Annie Oakley in Baker Street'', Leavitt claimed that Dr. Watson's revolver shot had toppled the villain Tonga from the deck of the ''Aurora'' into the [[River Thames]], and not Holmes's. In another piece Leavitt explored the hazy question of whether Dr. Arthur Watson had remarried.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXdKwl8evwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%22+wife&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-lhG5avvJr&amp;sig=CTL32HCoHo24FWAZcEEj1TWnHuI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA45,M1 ''In Bed with Sherlock Holmes: Sexual Elements in Arthur Conan Doyle's Stories of the Great Detective'', Christopher Redmond, Published by Dundurn Press Ltd., 1984] {{ISBN|0-88924-142-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-88924-142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt was a frequent contributor to ''The Baker Street Journal'', published by Ben Abramson, proprietor of [[Manhattan]]'s Argus Book Shop and a Holmes [[Fan (person)|aficionado]], who published musings of the best-known Sherlockians.

Within the close-knit Irregulars, Leavitt was known for his expertise in [[ballistics]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RsQIjpXdDEgC&amp;pg=PA25-IA2&amp;dq=Robert+Keith+Leavitt+-inauthor:%22Robert+Keith+Leavitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=X400SYiiHpTUlQSB2qnhBg#PPA296,M1 The Standard Doyle Company: Christopher Morley on Sherlock Holmes, by Christopher Morley, Steven Rothman, Fordham University Press, 1990] {{ISBN|0-8232-1292-0}} {{ISBN|978-0-8232-1292-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; optics and finances, sometimes combining them to examine the deeds of Conan Doyle's legendary hero.

When not writing about Holmes, Leavitt chose the company of friends like fellow Baker Street Irregulars Christopher Morley and [[Elmer Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;Don't Let Them Scare You: The Life and Times of Elmer Davis, by Roger Burlingame, published by Lippincott, 1961, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other writers, reporters, advertising men and artists of the day.

Leavitt had an only brother, Russell Greenleaf Leavitt, who graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1917, and who subsequently received a deferment from the military for poor eyesight. But Russell Leavitt joined the [[U.S. Navy]] and eventually wangled an assignment driving an ambulance for the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=04QfAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA508&amp;dq=Robert+Keith+Leavitt+-inauthor:%22Robert+Keith+Leavitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=3Ys0SbTwGIzckATd8ZC6BA Harvard Alumni Bulletin, Vol. XX, Number 1, Harvard Alumni Association, Harvard Bulletin Inc., Boston, Mass., 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Leavitt drove his ambulance on the front lines for 11 months, piloting his vehicle at [[Verdun]] and [[Flanders]], and eventually serving in the [[Chemical Warfare]] Service Laboratory at [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-78nAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Robert+Keith+Leavitt+-inauthor:%22Robert+Keith+Leavitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=kJI0SaC6CJSWkATTlL33BA Harvard College Class of 1889, Thirtieth Anniversary, 1889-1919, Eighth Report of the Class Secretary, June, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a piece called ''The Christmas Miracle'',  Bob Leavitt recalled tramping through the small [[Massachusetts]] town of [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]] on Christmas Eve at age six with his father Robert and brother Russell, searching for a Christmas tree. Leavitt's father stopped periodically and cut several tiny balsam seedlings. "Our father was a botanist Ph.D., given to plucking all manner of specimens wherever we walked, with the offhand explanation, '''A fine Tsuga canadensis'', or whatever it was," Leavitt wrote. 'By nightfall we had forgotten all about the walk." At home that evening, wondering about their tree, the two boys were shown a jar of earth devoid of plant life. If they sang '[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]' particularly well, their mother told them, the trees might grow.

The youngsters left the room, and began to sing. When they looked again, the seedlings had grown a foot. They repaired to the other room and sang some more. When they came back, the trees had grown again. "We went out and tried harder on that song," wrote Leavitt, "and when we re-entered the sitting room, the Tree had grown to perhaps a foot or so in height.... We went out and tried harder on that song. And sure enough this Time the tree was taller than either boy.... To this day I cannot hear 'O Little Town of Bethlehem,' from however cracked a curbside organ, without hearing through and beyond it the clear, true voice of my mother."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HsckPQkcVmgC&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=%22robert+keith+leavitt%27&amp;lr=#PPT10,M1 The Christmas Miracle, Robert Keith Leavitt, Christmas: A Time for Family, Lois L.

Bob Leavitt died at [[Scarsdale, New York]], in 1967. He was 72. His botanist father had died in 1942 while walking in [[Parsonsfield, Maine]]. His mother, Janet (Shumway) Leavitt, died of [[pneumonia]] in 1902 when Leavitt was seven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4955">'''Rosa Tschudi''' (21 April 1924 – 17 October 2015) was a Swiss [[chef]] and author. The national [[daily newspaper]] ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'' has called her the "Grand Dame" of [[Swiss cuisine|Swiss gastronomy]].&lt;ref name=ta&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Böniger |title=Die Grande Dame der Schweizer Gastronomie ist tot |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/leben/essen-und-trinken/Die-Grande-Dame-der-Schweizer-Gastronomie-ist-tot/story/15387781 |work=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] |date=2015-11-15 |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tschudi, a pioneering female chef in Switzerland, was awarded several [[Michelin stars]] during her career, which spanned 70 years&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; and cooked for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elisabeth II]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt;

== Restaurants owned ==
Rosa Tschudi was the owner of Hotel Krone in [[Gottlieben]], Switzerland from 1968 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.restaurant.ch/tippderwoche/Rosa+Tschudi+Woche+in+der+Krone+Gottlieben/379161/|title=restaurant.ch : Rosa-Tschudi-Woche in der Krone Gottlieben - Das Gastronomie-Portal|last=Wiesendanger|first=Mark|website=www.restaurant.ch|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then acquired restaurant Bären in [[Nürensdorf]] and Restaurant Tschudi in [[Gockhausen]], named after herself. In 1995 she took on Restaurant «Gian Grossi» in Zürich, which she managed right up to her retirement in 1997.

== Awards &amp; Achievements ==
Rosa Tschudi received two [[Michelin Guide|Michelin Stars]], one during her time at Restaurant "Tschudi", which was the first Michelin Star in Zurich Gastronomy,&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt; and one star at "Gian Grossi". [[Gault Millau]] awarded her with 17 points on numerous occasions.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt; She was a guest chef in several international kitchens, from Buenos Aires to Kairo over Hongkong to Brisbane, and cooked for numerous dignitaries, including [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt; Rosa Tschudi was also selected as one of the 15 chefs, cooking for the 70. birthday of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip,]] together with [[Anton Mosimann]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/zum-tod-von-rosa-tschudi-1.18632835|title=Zum Tod von Rosa Tschudi: Erfolgsrezepte einer begnadeten Schafferin|last=Bühler|first=Urs|date=2015-10-20|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|access-date=2017-04-28|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tschudi's specialty was a hearty local cuisine with "Haute Niveau", for example, "Fisch-Chnusperli", which is a Swiss dish of freshwater fish in beer batter, or [[Schwartenmagen]]. She also excelled at simple traditional dishes, such as marinated pot roast according to grandmother's recipe or handmade veal ravioli. A style of cooking which earned her the nickname "Grand Dame" of [[Helvetia|Helvetic]] cuisine.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt; In 1993 Tschudi created the menu for the First- Class cabin of [[Swissair]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  &lt;nowiki/&gt;

Rosa Tschudi published her own cooking book in 1999 during her retirement. The book is still widely available and liked by cooking enthusiasts. Receipts are said to be easy to replicate at home and range from Grande Cuisine to a variety of fish dishes, soups, marinated pot roasts, calf's head, tripe and Tschudi's infamous European perch fillets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.de/Erfolgsrezepte-meiner-K%C3%BCche-Rosa-Tschudi/dp/3855026718|title=Erfolgsrezepte aus meiner Küche|last=Tschudi|first=Rosa|date=1999-01-01|publisher=At Verlag|isbn=9783855026715|language=Deutsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Rosa Tschudi was a hands-on chef and business owner who was passionate about her work. Even though she was one to get her 'hands dirty' in the kitchen herself, she always liked to have a professional, groomed appearance with perfect makeup and she watched her figure. Tschudi loved jewelry and [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]] dresses, which she was only able to wear outside the kitchen.

When on holiday, Rosa Tschudi traveled across countries in order to eat at friends' places. Her favorite was Henry Levy in Berlin, who owned a legendary restaurant called Maître. Tschudi also frequently traveled for work and liked to accept invitations from five-star hotels to present their art to her. Rosa Tschudi especially liked her detours to Hongkong, various global cities, and luxury houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.journal21.ch/koeniginmutter-der-koeche|title=Königinmutter der Köche|work=Journal21|access-date=2017-04-28|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosa Tschudi died on 17 October 2015, at the age of 91.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt;

'''''The Second Bounce of the Ball: Turning Risk into Opportunity'''''  is a [[non-fiction]] book about [[entrepreneurship]], written by [[Sir Ronald Cohen]] and first published in 2007 by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, [[London]]. The book discusses what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur, and contains biographical anecdotes from the author and the company he founded, [[Apax Partners]].  The book’s title comes from Cohen’s incorrect belief that the [[Coefficient of restitution|second bounce of a ball]] is difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldcohen.net/|title=Ronald Cohen|accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914000945/http://www.ronaldcohen.net/|archivedate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
The book received positive reviews among the business literary critics. Robert Lenzner, editor of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, refers to Cohen as a modern-day version of [[Georges Doriot]], one of the first American [[venture capitalists]]. In his review, he highlights the biographical aspect of the book, saying that it "is at bottom about how Cohen progressed from boutique [[investment banker]] earning fees on each transaction to the risky business of financing start-up companies, and from there to the more solidly rewarding [[buyout]] or [[private equity]] business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/05/15/croesus-chronicles-doriot-oped-cz_rl_0516croesus.html?feed=rss_author|title=True Blue Gents Of Finance|last=Lenzner|first=Robert|date=May 16, 2008|work=Forbes|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Guthrie, from the [[Financial Times]], disagrees. He says that the book "is not an autobiography. But it is one of the best books written on entrepreneurship in recent years." In the review, he stated that some of the advice provided in the book can be found in other business [[self-help book]]s, but says that Sir Ronald's "analysis of entrepreneurship is broader and subtler than in most titles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?queryText=the+second+bounce+of+the+ball&amp;aje=true&amp;id=071112000052&amp;ct=0&amp;nclick_check=1|title=The trick is to stay ahead of the game|last=Guthrie|first=Jonathan|date=November 12, 2007 |publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Williams''' (13 May 1737 – 30 November 1802) was a Welsh industrialist and Member of Parliament. At the time of his death, he was the richest man in Wales.

==Life history==
Thomas Williams was born in [[Llanidan]], [[Anglesey]], the son of Owen Williams of Cefn Coch in Llansadwrn.&lt;ref name="Library of Wales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WILL-THO-1737.html | title=Williams, Thomas | work=National Library of Wales | author=Richard Thomas | date= | accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, there was a significant shortage of food for labouring people. Williams, known to his Welsh speaking workmen as ''Twm Chwarae Teg'' ("Tom Fairplay"), once complained to the magistrate at [[Llanidan]] that the villagers on [[Anglesey]] raided his fields and stole the [[turnip]]s intended for his cattle and used them to feed their families. His business rival, [[Matthew Boulton]], called Williams the "copper king" – "the despotick sovereign of the copper trade". To his friend and agent he said, "Let me advise you to be extremely cautious in your dealings with Williams".  He spoke of Williams as "a perfect tyrant and not over tenacious of his word and will screw damned hard when he has got anybody in his vice". Of the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] producers, Boulton said "they would not have submitted to be kicked and piss'd on by me as they have been by them" (Williams and his partner [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|Wilkinson]]).

Williams' tenacity as a lawyer was very evident when acting for the Hughes family of [[Llysdulas]] who were in an acrimonious dispute with Sir [[Sir Nicholas Bayly, 2nd Baronet|Nicholas Bayly]] of [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]] concerning the [[Parys Mountain]] copper mine. This dispute, which ran for over nine years, involved the interpretation of that very unsatisfactory testamentary device called a [[moiety title|moiety]]. At one stage the dispute involved four years of expensive litigation in the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery court]] with the [[Attorney General]] and the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] acting for opposing sides and was not finally settled until 1778. In that year Sir Nicholas leased his own copper mine to a London banker John Dawes (a secret associate of Williams) for 21 years.

Williams emerged from the dispute as the managing partner with the Revd Edward Hughes and John Dawes in the Parys Mine Company.  This under Williams control was cheap to run and extremely productive.  His great problem was to obtain an attractive price for the copper. He faced a cartel of copper smelters whose aim was to buy cheap and sell dear. He moved decisively to establish his own smelting facilities and quickly entered into an agreement with John Mackay to establish an industrial complex at [[Ravenhead]] near [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] in Lancashire. He also established warehousing and copper manufacturing and finishing facilities, and even a mint – thus creating a vertical organisation. In 1788, Williams purchased the Temple Mills at [[Bisham]] in Berkshire. He built himself a fine mansion there called Temple House and used the mills for smelting copper brought from his Welsh mines. He became MP for the nearby town of [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in Buckinghamshire. &lt;ref name = HoP&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/williams-thomas-1737-1802|title= WILLIAMS, Thomas (1737-1802), of Llanidan, Anglesey and Temple House, Berks.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate= 19 May 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

He also acted quickly to absorb or control other producers – notably the Cornish mines to produce a complete response to the cartel. Although always the driving force, Williams built up and controlled a major commercial organisation and surrounded himself with able staff. The Revd Edward was always a sleeping partner but younger brother Michael Hughes was an able manager. Other partners and staff included The [[Earl of Uxbridge]], Owen Williams, and Thomas Harrison.

His business organisation was first rate. He developed the technique of establishing his various businesses in separate companies. Thus the Parys Mine Company controlled its own smelting in South Wales, Lancashire and copper manufacture at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] and [[Wraysbury]]. Likewise the Mona mine (adjoining Parys) output was smelted by the Stanley Company in both Lancashire and South Wales. Other Companies dealt with manufacture at Greenfield near Flint and in the Thames Valley, Chemical Works (vitriol) at Garston Liverpool and still others with warehousing and banking.

Williams had built copper works at [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] and [[Penclawdd]] where he made copper and brass products. Many of these materials were for use in the [[African slave trade]]. These copper trinkets etc. were largely exported to Africa for use as payment for slaves, who were then transported to the [[West Indies]] and sold. The proceeds were then used to purchase commodities for import into Britain. Williams claimed to have invested £70,000 in this trade and petitioned parliament in 1788 when a bill was being discussed to prevent British ships from carrying slaves.  Williams is said also to have introduced the use of copper bolts to fix the copper sheeting to naval vessels and it would appear that he sold them to all sides in the naval conflicts. When he died in 1802, 1,200 people were employed in his Parys and Mona mines, but five years later the number had dropped to 120. This owing partly to the collapse of copper prices, but also to the exhaustion of the known local copper deposits – but no doubt largely resulting from the death of the firm's great driving force.

He was [[High Sheriff of Anglesey]] for 1790–91.&lt;ref name = HoP/&gt;

[[File:HK Tsim Sha Tsui 200901.jpg|thumb|300px|Tsim Sha Tsui, seen from [[Hong Kong Island]].]]

'''Tsim Sha Tsui''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|尖沙咀}}}}), often abbreviated as '''TST''', is an [[list of areas of Hong Kong|urban area]] in southern [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]]. The area is administratively part of the [[Yau Tsim Mong District]]. Tsim Sha Tsui East is a piece of land reclaimed from the [[Hung Hom Bay]] now east of Tsim Sha Tsui. The area is bounded north by [[Austin Road]] and in the east by Hong Chong Road and Cheong Wan Road.

Geographically, Tsim Sha Tsui is a [[cape (geography)|cape]] on the tip of the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] pointing towards [[Victoria Harbour]], opposite [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]. Several villages had been established in this location before Kowloon [[Convention of Peking|was ceded]] to the [[British Empire]] in 1860. ''Tsim Sha Tsui'' in Chinese means ''sharp [[spit (landform)|sandspit]]''. It was also known as '''Heung Po Tau''' ({{linktext|香|埗|頭}}), i.e. a port for exporting [[Aquilaria sinensis|incense tree]].

Tsim Sha Tsui is a [[Tourism in Hong Kong|major tourist hub]] in metropolitan Hong Kong, with many high-end shops and restaurants that cater to tourists. Many of [[List of museums in Hong Kong|Hong Kong's museums]] are located in the area.

==Etymology==
The name Tsim Sha Tsui ({{zh|c=尖沙咀}}) means 'sharp sandspit' in [[Cantonese]]. The traditional and archaic form of Tsim Sha Tsui in Chinese has the same pronunciation but is written differently ({{zh|c=尖沙嘴}}).

==Geography==
Before any [[land reclamation in Hong Kong|land reclamation]], Tsim Sha Tsui consisted of two parallel capes with a bay in between in the south. The west cape, '''Kowloon Point''', the proper Tsim Sha Tsui, coincided with the small hill where the [[Former Marine Police Headquarters]] is sited, while the east cape was the hill that is today known as [[Blackhead Point]]. The bay between the capes extended as far north as the present-day [[Mody Road]]. Today, [[Canton Road]] marks the western edge of Tsim Sha Tsui, and [[Chatham Road]] the eastern edge. The area is hilly, although many hills were levelled for reclamation.

==History==
[[Image:Tsim Sha Tsui from Yuet Tai Kei.png|thumb|The position of Tsim Sha Tsui (pink) during [[Ming Dynasty]]]]
[[File:TST aerophoto.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Tsim Sha Tsui in early 20th century. The [[Kowloon Station (KCR)|Kowloon Station]] (low left corner), the [[former Marine Police Headquarters]] (on the hill inland behind the station), and the Peninsula Hotel (centre)]]
Historical maps in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] or [[Qing Dynasty]] named the channel between Tsim Sha Tsui and [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] as '''Chung Mun''' (Pinyin: Zhong Men, 中門, lit. the middle gate) as it is located in the middle of the two other channels, [[Kap Shui Mun]] in the west and [[Lei Yue Mun]] in the east, in the harbour.

Before Kowloon [[Convention of Peking|was ceded]] to Britain in 1860, many villages were present in the area. Incense trees (''[[Aquilaria sinensis]]'') from [[New Territories]] were gathered at some quays in Tsim Sha Tsui and transferred to [[Shek Pai Wan]] in southern [[Hong Kong Island]] to be exported to rest of the world. It was thus known as Heung Po Tau, the fragrant quay. Shortly after the land was ceded to Britain, construction began on the first section of Tsim Sha Tsui's major thoroughfare, [[Nathan Road]].

In 1888, the [[Star Ferry]] offered regular transport between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, and the area has flourished ever since. Until the 20th century, Tsim Sha Tsui was a leafy suburb dominated by the people and facilities of the British military. [[Whitfield Barracks]], converted into [[Kowloon Park]] in 1970, ran to the west of [[Nathan Road]], and Kowloon Naval Yard occupied the waterfront to the west of the army encampment. In the early 20th century, Chinese people were allowed to live in the area to attract more people to trade in the colony. Garden houses were replaced with crowded residential blocks. [[Wharf|Wharves]] and [[godown]]s were built along the west shore. Major developers like [[Hormusjee Naorojee Mody]] and [[Catchick Paul Chater]] actively participated in the development of Tsim Sha Tsui.

The [[Kowloon–Canton Railway]] (British Section) commenced service on 1 October 1910. [[Kowloon Station (KCR)|Kowloon Station]] in Tsim Sha Tsui was built on the new southern reclamation from 1913 to 1915. The rails extended along the western reclamation parallel to [[Chatham Road]], with old [[Hung Hom Station]] near the [[Gun Club Hill Barracks]] at the junction of Chatham Road and [[Austin Road]]. Another major road, [[Salisbury Road, Hong Kong|Salisbury Road]], was completed in approximately the same period. The landmark [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] was built on the reclamation in 1928, opposite to the station.

The Kowloon Station was relocated to a new Hung Hom Station in 1978. The whole station and rails were demolished except the landmark [[Clock Tower, Tsim Sha Tsui|Clock Tower]]. [[Hong Kong Space Museum]] and later the [[Hong Kong Cultural Centre]] were erected on the site. The rails were replaced with [[New World Centre]] and other gardens in [[Tsim Sha Tsui East]].

In 2016 the [[Tsim Sha Tsui Waterfront Revitalisation Plan]] was shelved due to public controversy.

==Industry==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Harbour City Overview 2011.jpg|thumb|right|The southern tip of Tsim Sha Tsui, with the [[Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal]] and [[Harbour City (Hong Kong)|Harbour City]].]]
Tsim Sha Tsui remains [[tertiary sector]] from colonial days to present. In early colonial days, transport, tourism and trading are main business of the area. As port and rail facilities moved out of the area, the major industry falls on the later two. Tsim Sha Tsui, like [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], contains several centres of finance. After [[Kai Tak Airport]] closed, the height restrictions on buildings has dropped and now larger taller skyscrapers, parallel to those of Central, have been constructed.

==Demography==
There are a substantial number of African, [[India]]n and [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] minorities in the area. In colonial days, many Indians set up their businesses or joined the army and police force in Hong Kong, and their descendents continue to live in the territory. In recent years, Hong Kong has also attracted African traders, especially those of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], to trade in the territory. Most of them are transient residents and live in inns in the area.

==Recreation and tourist attractions==
===Hotels===
[[File:The Peninsula Hong Kong (full view).jpg|thumb|[[The Peninsula Hong Kong|The Peninsula]] and its office towers.]]
Tourist hospitality is a major industry in Tsim Sha Tsui. The area has the highest concentration of hotels in Hong Kong. Prominent and renowned hotels include [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|The Peninsula]], [[The Kowloon Hotel]] at [[Middle Road, Hong Kong|Middle Road]], [[Kowloon Shangri-La]], the [[InterContinental Hong Kong]], the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Hotel, three [[Marco Polo Hotels Group|Marco Polo Hotels]], [[Langham Hotels International|The Langham]] Hong Kong, the Renaissance Kowloon Hotel (since demolished), [[The Mira Hong Kong]], [[Baden-Powell International House]], [[Hotel Icon (Hong Kong)|Hotel Icon]] and the [[Hotel Panorama]]. The [[Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui|Hyatt Regency Hong Kong]] was closed on 1 January 2006 and the [[iSQUARE]] shopping mall was built at its former location. It has re-opened in October 2009 on Hanoi Road of Tsim Sha Tsui within the new [[The Masterpiece (Hong Kong)|The Masterpiece]] skyscraper. Other hotels in virtually every price range and level of luxury can be found throughout the area; [[Chungking Mansions]] is well known for providing cheap lodging for backpackers.

===Restaurants===

Tsim Sha Tsui is one of many places to find exotic restaurants in Hong Kong. [[Hillwood Road]] at the north of [[Observatory Hill, Hong Kong|Observatory Hill]] concentrates on restaurants of different national dishes. [[Knutsford Terrace]] on the other side of the hill is a terrace of pubs. [[Kimberley Street]] is famous for the [[Korean cuisine]] restaurants and grocery stores, especially after the advent of [[Korean Wave]] (韓流) in Hong Kong, giving the street the nickname of [[Koreatown]] (小韓國). Located on [[Nathan Road]], the [[Chungking Mansions]] is a major tourist attraction in Tsim Sha Tsui. Georgetown Parade is well known for its dog nose biscuits. These recognisable buildings were featured in the film ''[[Chungking Express]]'', and are full of inexpensive guest houses, Indian restaurants, and money changers.

===Tourist attractions===
[[File:Kowloon Clock Tower June 18 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Clock Tower, Tsim Sha Tsui|Former Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower]] in Tsim Sha Tsui is a famous landmark of Hong Kong.]]
Tsim Sha Tsui was once the terminus of the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] (KCR). After the British Section of the railway was opened for traffic on 1 October 1910, the construction of the railway station in Tsim Sha Tsui started in 1913. Construction on the railway station and its clock tower were completed in 1915. The main building of the Tsim Sha Tsui station was demolished in 1978. The station was relocated to [[Hung Hom]] to make way for the [[Hong Kong Space Museum]] and the [[Hong Kong Cultural Centre]]. But the [[Clock Tower, Hong Kong|Clock Tower]] of the station was not demolished and was kept in place. It is all that remains standing of the station. The clock tower is forty-four metres high, surmounted by a seven metre high lightning rod. It is now surrounded by the public piazza of the Cultural Centre and has become a landmark of Hong Kong. Six pillars of the railway were relocated to the [[Urban Council Centenary Garden]] in [[Tsim Sha Tsui#Tsim Sha Tsui East|TST East]]. The [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong|Avenue of Stars]] starts at the "[[New World Centre]]" shopping centre near the Cultural Centre. There is also the attraction of shopping at a clothing store frequented by famous people from all over the world, at [[Sam's Tailor]].

The Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront is another popular destination for locals and tourists alike. It is especially popular for photographers, as it offers an unobstructed view of the [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] area of Hong Kong across [[Victoria Harbour]]. The [[Star Ferry]] terminal is another popular attraction for tourists, and the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong|Avenue of Stars]] is also popular with photographers.

Tsim Sha Tsui is also a great place to watch Christmas lightings during December every year as tall buildings in the district will set up light bulbs on their walls with Christmas patterns, which is a well known famous scene.

==East Tsim Sha Tsui==
'''East Tsim Sha Tsui''' or '''Tsim Sha Tsui East'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/dine-drink/where-to-eat/east-tsim-sha-tsui.jsp Tsim Sha Tsui East, Hong Kong Tourism Board]&lt;/ref&gt; (尖沙咀東 or simply 尖東) is an area east of Chatham Road South [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed]] from [[Hung Hom Bay]] in the 1970s. Many restaurants, [[office building]]s and hotels are located in the area. The [[Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade]] links the area with the Hong Kong Cultural Centre near the Clock Tower. In 2004, the East Rail Line returned to Tsim Sha Tsui with the extension of the line from Hung Hom to the new [[East Tsim Sha Tsui Station]], which serves as an interchange station with Tsim Sha Tsui station on the [[Tsuen Wan Line]]. Unlike other East Rail Line stations, it was built underground near [[Blackhead Point]]. An extensive tunnel system was constructed for pedestrians to access the most popular destinations in Tsim Sha Tsui, and to change trains between the two lines.

==Landscape==
{{wide image|Kowloon Panorama.JPG|800px|align-cap=center|A panorama of Tsim Sha Tsui taken from Hong Kong Island.}}

==Public transport==
===Trains===
Tsim Sha Tsui is served by the [[MTR]] [[Tsim Sha Tsui Station]], on the [[Tsuen Wan Line|Tsuen Wan&amp;nbsp;Line]]. Another station, [[East Tsim Sha Tsui Station]], opened in late 2004 as a southern extension of the [[East Rail Line|East Rail&amp;nbsp;Line]] from [[Hung Hom Station]]. On 16 August 2009, the [[Kowloon Southern Link]] of the [[West Rail Line]], from [[Nam Cheong Station]] to East Tsim Sha Tsui Station was opened. Simultaneously, the segment between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Hung Hom Station was transferred from the East Rail Line to the West Rail Line, so Hung Hom Station is now the interchange station between the East Rail Line and the West Rail Line. East Tsim Sha Tsui Station is connected to Tsim Sha Tsui Station and a number of locations in the area though an extensive pedestrian subway network.

===Ferries===
The [[Star Ferry]] connects Tsim Sha Tsui to [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Wan Chai]]. Various [[hydrofoil]] services out of the [[Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal]] on [[Canton Road]] link Tsim Sha Tsui to [[Macau]], [[Guangzhou]], and several other places in the [[Pearl River Delta]].

===Buses===
Since Tsim Sha Tsui is in the heart of Kowloon Peninsula, the area is served by an extensive network of bus routes to many parts of Hong Kong. There are major bus terminals beside the Star Ferry terminal and atop East Tsim Sha Tsui underground station on Chatham Road.
