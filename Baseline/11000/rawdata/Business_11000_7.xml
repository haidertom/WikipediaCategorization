'''''Absolute Power''''' is a British comedy series, set in the offices of Prentiss McCabe, a fictional [[public relations]] company (or 'government-media relations consultancy') in London, run by Charles Prentiss ([[Stephen Fry]]) and Martin McCabe ([[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]]).

It started in 2000 on [[BBC Radio 4]], lasting until 2004 with the fourth and final radio series. A six-part television series ran on [[BBC Two]] towards the end of 2003; the second six-episode television series ran on BBC Two on Thursdays at 10 pm from 21 July to 25 August 2005. A one-off radio episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006.

The title is taken from a quotation by the historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]: "power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely".

}}
The series was devised and written by [[Mark Tavener]], and logically follows the series ''[[In the Red (novel)|In the Red]]'', ''In the Balance'', ''In the Chair'', and ''In the End'' which he wrote with [[Peter Baynham]]. In some of these, Prentiss and McCabe (again played by Fry and Bird) are elevated members of the [[BBC]], before getting kicked out. Indeed, there is a scene on the last page of the novel ''[[In the Red (novel)|In the Red]]'', in which the newly appointed director general of the [[BBC]] gives them the sack.
The idea is that after this they created Prentiss McCabe, which is the subject of ''Absolute Power''. The tone and style of ''Absolute Power'' is so different from the ''In the...'' series that it can be regarded as a totally different programme. It was produced, like so much of Tavener's work, by Dawn Ellis.

Prentiss is a man without morals, whose only objectives are money and power. He is portrayed as being the brains, while McCabe, though an excellent speech-writer, lacks his motivation and insight. McCabe's ambitions include retiring and drinking [[claret]], and he spends his life in a state of cynicism, lack of energy and boredom. McCabe (who describes himself as "a first class mind") does sometimes have good ideas, but they usually become Prentiss's ideas by the time they are presented to the client, and he lacks the energy to make more than mild objections. McCabe is also more likely to baulk at a scheme for moral reasons than Prentiss.

Stephen Fry said of Charles Prentiss, "He's a brute of a man, out to win, with no morals; he's completely shameless. There's not much to say that's nice about him, except that there is some pleasure in watching a natural born killer at work and knowing whatever happens he will win".

Prentiss and McCabe often find themselves working on behalf of two rival clients, one of whom is often the shadier side of the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government, often called their "Downing Street Retainer". This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch ([[Tony Gardner]], [[Alex Lowe (actor)|Alex Lowe]]), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as [[Frank Dobson]]'s campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the [[European Union]], while also being employed by the [[Eurosceptic]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe seems to want to do any real work.

The third member of the company is Sandy ([[Siobhan Hayes]]), who is there as the office trainee, getting work experience for her [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]] level 2. She usually does all the work that the partners in the firm cannot be bothered to do, such as filling out thousands of public opinion polls in different handwritings, though she will only agree to do something if it can be twisted into one of the 'nine levels of competence' of her NVQ. Another member of the office is the useless Clive ([[Tom George (actor)|Tom George]]) or as Martin calls him, 'young, er, thing', who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths. He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).

Another regular character is Maurice, the waiter at McCabe's [[gentlemen's club (traditional)|club]]. Each time he serves McCabe's claret, he corrects the English pronunciation of Maurice (Morris) to the French (Maur-ees), and each time Prentiss puts him down with a verse like "One man by circumstance is in splendour set; whilst another irons pants in a laundrette. Go and iron my pants, Morris".

In series 1, one of the running jokes is the company trying to avoid working on "The Sir Harold Dixon Account." Although he is never heard, it is known that he is a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician. As the series goes on, Sandy becomes more frustrated, and in the last episode she changes jobs and starts working for Sir Harold. However, after allegations of sleaze, Sir Harold is made bankrupt and Sandy returns to Prentiss McCabe.

In series 2, another character was created, Gayle Shand, played by [[Tamsin Greig]]. Gayle was a former employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, with whom she had a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from [[Philadelphia]]. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the [[Tony Blair|PM]] via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the [[Gordon Brown|Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Prentiss McCabe always come up with a plan to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle's attempts to stop them, even trying to make Charles a partner in her firm.

Also introduced was her assistant, Janice&lt;!--not sure who played her!--&gt;, who suspected that Gayle's personal rivalry with Charles did not lead to the best decisions.

In the last episode of series 2, Gayle was leaving for America, and made one last bet with Charles. She bet her company against Charles's testicles that he could not make the [[Home Secretary]] say, "Prison doesn't work". Despite Charles's best attempts, Gayle won because she bribed the Home Secretary, as she was having an affair with someone in the Home Office. Luckily, she called off the bet providing Charles could make love to her to the tune of the [[1812 overture]]. Charles managed to get his own back, however, by planting some Class A Drugs in her suitcase as she left for America. Charles may nevertheless still have some feelings for her, and sometimes reminisces about their relationship.

A one-off special episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006, with Tony Gardner playing Archie. In the special, Martin goes to jail for seven years for fraud (having been implicated in the [[Cash for Peerages]] scandal). Archie, who has left New Labour, then blackmails Charles into giving him a job to prevent any more embarrassing information getting out about the company.

However, Charles soon learns that in fact Archie has framed both Martin and himself, with the assistance of Martin's girlfriend, and they are planning to take over Prentiss McCabe. After Charles finds proof, Archie goes to jail and Martin gets released, but as he has been moved to an open prison, he does not feel like leaving too soon.

The radio series is sometimes repeated on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] as part of the "Comedy Club" hour.

===Hutton Report===
The first episode of series 4 was controversially edited because of references to the [[Hutton Report]]. The words "manipulation and lying" was cut from Prentiss's line: "There's nothing Prentiss McCabe can teach this Prime Minister about deception, manipulation and lying, except how to do it properly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3453603.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; BBC denies axing political satire |publisher=BBC News |date=3 February 2004 |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writewords.org.uk/news/381.asp |title=BBC censor comedy scripts in post-Hutton panic and paranoia |publisher=Writewords.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204071940/http://www.writewords.org.uk/news/381.asp |archivedate=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television series was written by [[Guy Andrews]], [[Mark Lawson]] and Andrew Rattenbury, and had the tag "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]] is dead, long live [[public relations|PR]]". Unlike most radio to TV sitcom transfers, none of the TV episodes was based on a radio episode. There are many differences to the radio version. Prentiss McCabe is a much more powerful and respected organisation than in the radio series. Martin McCabe is much more worldly wise. The secret meetings with government representatives are gone and replaced with more cups of coffee with newspaper editors and private secretaries.

While the radio series has one trainee, the TV version has several young professionals working at the agency. Most notable are Jamie Front ([[James Lance]]) and Alison Jackman ([[Zoe Telford]]). While Jamie is a brilliant liar and naturally devious, Alison is very intelligent but too honest and somewhat literal-minded. Charles Prentiss said of her, "Most of the young people here at Prentiss McCabe don't know their arse from their elbow, but with Alison, at least you know she'll join the Royal Arse Society and get a book about elbows from the library". Also in the firm are Cat Durnford ([[Sally Bretton]]), the young party girl, and Nick Mayer ([[Nicholas Burns (British actor)|Nick Burns]]), Charles's personal assistant.

Instead of political schemes, the agency concentrates on working with celebrities: something that is rare in the radio version. In the radio episode where McCabe works with a [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]] contestant, this is shown as an exceptional event, but would be normal behaviour in the TV series. Contrariwise, in the TV episode "The House of Lords", Charles is mildly surprised to be contacted by a government spin doctor.

===The London bombings===
Owing to the terrorist attacks on London on the 7 and 21 July 2005, the first episode of the second series (in which a member of the [[bin Laden family]] attempted to buy [[British Airways]]) was replaced by an episode from later in the series. The bin Laden episode was aired several weeks later.

==Critical reception – Television series==

*{{quote|Transferring a radio series to television can be risky [...] Absolute Power, however, succeeds where previous comedies have failed, and looks set to do for PR what [[Drop The Dead Donkey]] did for the newsroom. A good cast helps.|''[[The Independent]]'', 8 November 2003}}
*{{quote|fitfully amusing comedy|Stuart Price in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', 9 November 2003}}
*{{quote|The script presses the right buttons relentlessly. The names that are invoked contribute artfully to the atmosphere of heightened unreality. The idea of Mark Thatcher is tossed about in this corner, while the notion of Dennis Waterman is examined in another [...] I suppose it is a credit to all involved in the programme that I didn't like it at all. Although the characters are clearly exaggerations and grotesques, I felt they were probably close enough to the truth to be convincing. Form and content were perfectly matched. Like [[Trevor's World of Sport]], of which this is clearly a superior relation, it is impossible to like any of the characters. [...] It delivers a stringently corrective dose of satire. It is quite appallingly knowing, and deliberately so.|Pete Clark in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 11 November 2003}}

'''Alan Charles Noble''' is an Australian [[engineer]], technology [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] and founder of the not-for-profit [[marine conservation]] organisation, AusOcean. 

== Career ==
Noble studied at the [[University of Adelaide]] and [[Stanford University]] where he obtained a Bachelor of Electronic and Electrical Engineering and a Master of Computer Science Artificial Intelligence respectively.

He worked in established and startup technology companies in [[Japan]], [[Silicon Valley]] and [[Australia]]. Some of his start-up technology ventures lead to acquisitions by [[Nokia]] and Riverbed Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tedxadelaide.com.au/2017/alan-noble-2017-speaker-profile/index.html|title=Alan Noble {{!}} 2017 Speaker Profile|date=2017-10-19|work=TEDxAdelaide|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Noble joined [[Google]] Australia, and in 2008 he was appointed as an Adjunct Professor at the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/adelaidean/issues/24441/news24484.html|title=Adelaidean -- Google director is new professor|website=www.adelaide.edu.au|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 2000s, Noble has acted as an advisor to the Australian government, including for the [[Office of the Chief Scientist (Australia)|Chief Scientist of Australia]], the [[Australian Information Commissioner]] and the Government 2.0 Taskforce.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausocean.org/about|title=About AusOcean|website=www.ausocean.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Noble founded StartupAUS, following on from his experience with the angel investment group SA Angels (2007-2014). In 2014, he appeared in Episode 1 of ''That Startup Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.larkspurcomms.com/blog/|title=blog|website=Larkspur Communications|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Noble was appointed as a director of the board of the [[South Australian Museum]].

In 2016, the Kangaroo Island Wilderness Trail was surveyed by Google Street View Trekker under Alan Noble's lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/Home/Full_newsevents_listing/News_Events_Listing/161013-premier-launches-kiwt|title=Department for Environment and Water|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble also bought property on Kangaroo Island that year. Meanwhile, his property at [[Willunga, South Australia|Willunga]] became the first residential customer of Redflow's ZCell off-grid energy storage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/10/googles-aussie-engineering-boss-has-gone-off-the-grid/|title=Google's Aussie Engineering Boss Has Gone Off The Grid|date=2016-10-19|work=Gizmodo Australia|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Dadon''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 1957) is an Australian businessman, philanthropist and musician. He was born in [[Morocco]] and grew up in [[Israel]] and [[France]] before immigrating to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1983. He is prominent in promoting cultural and business links between Australia and [[Israel]]. He undertakes a range of activities covering international affairs, political activism and cultural activities within Australia and overseas exchange programs. He is executive chairman of [[Ubertas Group]], a diversified funds management and property development company.

From 1991 to 1993 Dadon was chairman of the French [[Chamber of Commerce]] in Australia (Victorian Chapter). He established “Le Concours des Vins du Victoria”, a wine competition in Australia.

From 1994 to 1996, he was director of the Australia French Foundation, an appointment made by Senator [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Australia. This foundation was initiated by the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], as a gift to France for the bicentennial of the [[French Revolution]].

In 2001 Dadon was chairman of the [[United Israel Appeal]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He founded in 2002 and then chaired the [[Australian Israel Cultural Exchange]], an organization launched through a Joint Declaration between the Australian and Israeli Governments. A joint declaration announcing and supporting the establishment of AICE by [[Alexander Downer]] MP, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] MK, Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, took place simultaneously in [[Parliament House, Canberra]] and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, [[Jerusalem]]. It was the first time that such a joint declaration has been made between the two countries. Dadon also publishes a quarterly magazine for AICE titled ''Rhapsody''. 

From 2003 to 2005 Dadon was chairman of the [[Melbourne Jazz Festival]]. In 2005 he brought to Melbourne the [[Umbria]] [[Jazz]] Festival, which was named “Umbria Jazz Melbourne 05”. The festival in 2005 attracted 135,000 visitors under the artistic direction of [[Carlo Pagnotta]]. The festival is mainly funded by the [[Victorian government]] through Victoria Major Event Company and Arts Victoria. In 2006 the organisation appointed Dadon to become the new director of the festival and take the artistic lead. 

The appointment of Dadon as artistic director resulted in a change of name of the festival to Melbourne Jazz, and the 2007 edition of the festival enjoyed the presence of more than 200 artists from the world around, performing in ten venues in 112 concerts during its ten days. Some of the artists who played at the festival were [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Gary Burton]] and [[McCoy Tyner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/new-jazz-festival-chief-promises-big-names/2006/09/14/1157827089276.html |title=New jazz festival chief promises big names  |author=Andra Jackson |date= 15 September 2006|publisher=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Dadon founded the [[Australian Jazz Bell Awards]] (named after Australian legend and patron of the event [[Graeme Bell]], AO). Dadon chairs the board of The Australian Jazz Awards Limited (a not-for-profit arts organisation) that governs the awards. The Bells are the only  form of formal recognition system entirely devoted to the jazz art form in Australia. They recognise the achievements of young and established Australian jazz performers and composers. 

In 2008 Dadon received an [[Order of Australia]] (AM) for service to the arts, particularly through the Melbourne Jazz Festival, through philanthropic support for cultural and charitable organisations, and to business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Infovic/governor/governor.nsf/WVINV/D04EEB9E599DB2FCCA2574BA001ADB52 |title=Investiture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519092454/http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Infovic/governor/governor.nsf/WVINV/D04EEB9E599DB2FCCA2574BA001ADB52 |archivedate=2009-05-19 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Dadon established the Australia Israel Leadership Forum which then became the Australia UK Israel Leadership Dialogue once the UK joined the group in 2011.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://spectator.com.au/2016/12/jerusalem-diary/|title=The Spectator - Jerusalem Diary|author=Tony Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Albert Dadon realised one of his long-term dreams with the opening of Bird's Basement, a Jazz Club in [[Melbourne]], in association with Birdland New York. {{cite web| url=http://www.3aw.com.au/news/birds-basement-aiming-to-join-the-cultural-calendar-of-melbourne-20160414-go6c4z.html|title=Bird's Basement Website}} {{Quote|text=This is something that is going to be part of the cultural calendar of Melbourne. |author=Albert Dadon}}

Under his stage name "Albare", Dadon is a jazz [[guitarist]] and [[composer]]. He has recorded two albums with [[Festival Records]] in Australia and produced ''A History of Standard Time'', [[Joe Chindamo]]’s first solo recording and featuring [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]]. His latest albums are ''Midnight Blues'' (2007), ''After the Rain'' (2009), ''Travel Diary'' (2010), ''Long Way'' (2012), ''The Road Ahead'' (2013), ''2 Decades of Jazz'' (2014), ''Only Human'' (2015) and ''Dream Time'' (2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3420">'''Bjorn Axelsson''' (born July 12, 1948) is a Swedish [[organizational theorist]] and Professor of Business Administration at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], known for his work on industrial networks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Snehota, Ivan]], and [[Hakan Hakansson]], eds. ''Developing relationships in business networks.'' Routledge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maskell, Peter, and Anders Malmberg. "Localised learning and industrial competitiveness." ''Cambridge journal of economics'' 23.2 (1999): 167-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Uppsala County]], Axelsson obtained his PhD at the [[Uppsala University]] in 1981&lt;ref name="SSE 2015"&gt;[http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=10621033 Björn Axelsson]. profile at ''hhs.se.'' Accessed 01.02.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; with the thesis, entitled "Wikmanshyttans uppgång och fall: en kommentar till angreppssättet i en företagshistorisk studie" (The rise and fall of the Wikmanshyttan steel works : a commentary to the approach in a company history study).

After his graduation Axelsson started his academic career at [[Uppsala University]], where he managed the Uppsala Executive MBA program since the mid 1980s. In 1998 he moved to the [[Jönköping International Business School]], where he was appointed Professor in Marketing. In 2002 he moved to the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], where he holds the Olof A Söderberg chair in Business Administration, and became head of the D-section. From 2005 to 2009 he also held the Silf Chair in Purchasing and Supply Management at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="SSE 2015"/&gt;

Axelsson's research interests are in the field of "business- to- business markets both from marketing and sourcing/purchasing perspectives, but it also concerns the very functioning of such markets. The studies in both marketing and purchasing frequently address organizational issues. Themes such as effectively organizing marketing activities and creating strategic change in purchasing benefit from organization theories which therefore have become a very important scientific body of support."&lt;ref name="SSE 2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6233">'''Cognitive inertia''' refers to the tendency for [[beliefs]] or sets of beliefs to endure once formed. In particular, cognitive inertia describes the [[Human behavior|human]] inclination to rely on familiar assumptions and exhibit a reluctance and/or inability to revise those assumptions, even when the evidence supporting them no longer exists or when other evidence calls them into question. The term is employed in the [[Organizational studies|managerial and organizational sciences]] to describe the commonly observed phenomenon whereby managers fail to update and revise their understanding of a situation when that situation changes, a phenomenon that acts as a psychological barrier to organizational change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huff|first=James O.|last2=Huff|first2=Anne S.|last3=Thomas|first3=Howard|date=1992-06-01|title=Strategic renewal and the interaction of cumulative stress and inertia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.4250131006/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=S1|pages=55–75|doi=10.1002/smj.4250131006|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgkinson|first=Gerard P.|date=1997-11-01|title=Cognitive Inertia in a Turbulent Market: the Case of UK Residential Estate Agents|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-6486.00078/abstract|journal=Journal of Management Studies|language=en|volume=34|issue=6|pages=921–945|doi=10.1111/1467-6486.00078|issn=1467-6486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reger|first=Rhonda K.|last2=Palmer|first2=Timothy B.|date=1996-02-01|title=Managerial Categorization of Competitors: Using Old Maps to Navigate New Environments|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.7.1.22|journal=Organization Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=22–39|doi=10.1287/orsc.7.1.22|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldfarb|first=Avi|last2=Ho|first2=Teck-Hua|last3=Amaldoss|first3=Wilfred|last4=Brown|first4=Alexander L.|last5=Chen|first5=Yan|last6=Cui|first6=Tony Haitao|last7=Galasso|first7=Alberto|last8=Hossain|first8=Tanjim|last9=Hsu|first9=Ming|date=2012-06-01|title=Behavioral models of managerial decision-making|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11002-012-9183-4|journal=Marketing Letters|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=405–421|doi=10.1007/s11002-012-9183-4|issn=0923-0645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hollow|first=Matthew|date=2014-07-04|title=Strategic inertia, financial fragility and organisational failure: The case of the Birkbeck Bank, 1870–1911|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00076791.2013.839660|journal=Business History|volume=56|issue=5|pages=746–764|doi=10.1080/00076791.2013.839660|issn=0007-6791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In business==
Cognitive inertia in business is most commonly seen in product development and marketing. Once a business becomes established, it will often ignore the competitive space until it has changed so completely it can no longer adapt products to match the new environment. Firms will also only market to one demographic and lose potential customers because they do not fit into its original views.

One example of cognitive inertia concerns managers at the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid corporation]] and its managers judgment that they could not make money on hardware but only on consumables, This led them to neglect [[digital imaging]] technologies.  The once-successful company failed to adapt effectively to market changes and thus lost revenue and ultimately declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tripsas|first=Mary|last2=Gavetti|first2=Giovanni|date=2000-10-01|title=Capabilities, cognition, and inertia: evidence from digital imaging|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/113.0.CO;2-R/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=10–11|pages=1147–1161|doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11&lt;1147::aid-smj128&gt;3.0.co;2-r|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the vacuum industry displayed cognitive intertia.  Companies kept making similar models until [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]].  revolutionized the industry with a bagless vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3000559/why-inertia-kills-companies|title=Why Inertia Kills Companies|date=2012-08-20|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==
Once a belief is well-established, it is very difficult for cultures to overcome it until evidence forces them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dicke|first=Tom|date=2015-04-01|title=Waiting for the Flu: Cognitive Inertia and the Spanish Influenza Pandemic of 1918–19|url=https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article/70/2/195/776261|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=70|issue=2|pages=195–217|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jru019|issn=0022-5045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case during the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Influenza]] epidemic in the United States (1918-1919). Many Americans did not believe that an influenza from Spain could affect them until the majority of the country was already infected.

==In relationships==
Not all instances of cognitive inertia are negative. Cognitive inertia is a fundamental component of [[love]], [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] and [[friendship]].  Once cognitive inertia is established, it provides an additional level of trust in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catton|first=William R.|date=1969|title=What's in a Name?

'''''Corporate DNA''''' is [[business jargon]] for [[organizational culture]]. It is a metaphor based on the biological term ''[[DNA]]'', the molecule that encodes the genetic instructions in living organisms.{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}}{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=5}}

In a 1997 book, Gareth Morgan defined the corporate DNA metaphor as the "visions, values, and sense of purpose that bind an organization together" to enable individuals to "understand and absorb the mission and challenge of the whole enterprise".{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=95}} Lindgreen and Swaen define it as an "organization's culture and strategy".{{sfn|Lindgreen|Swaen|2010}} Ken Baskin defines it as "flexible, universally available database of company procedures and structures" which develops from the company's history, and that the organization's employees behave to satisfy the resultant corporate identity.{{sfn|Mason|2006|ps=This corporate DNA is built from past history and Baskin believes that people act in ways to fulfil a company's identity due to the corporate DNA}} Baskin also likens the availability of information throughout an organization to the presence of DNA in all of an organism's [[Cell (biology)|cells]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1999}} [[Arnold Kransdorff]] defines corporate DNA as the set of institution-specific experiences that "characterizes any organization's ability to perform".{{sfn|Kransdorff|2006|p=Back cover}}&lt;!-- similar claims are in the text, but I don't have access to it --&gt;

==Definition==
In a ''[[Strategy+Business]]'' article, Gary Neilson, Bruce A. Pasternack, and Decio Mendes state that the four DNA bases for an organization are its structure, decision rights, motivating factors, and information.{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}} In the book ''DNA Profiling : The Innovative Company: How to Increase Creative Ability in Business'', Isabelle Denervaud and Olivier Chatin state that the four organizational bases are actors, ideation, emotion, and collaboration.{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=17-18}} Denervaud and Chatin also extend the metaphor by identifying factors that may mutate organizational DNA (discontinuity, traditional playing fields, new lands, and individuals),{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=5, 19}} much like a genetic [[mutation]] may change the [[nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] of the [[genome]] of an organism, and Neilson, Pasternack, and Mendes describe a company adapting to structural and environmental changes analogous to biological [[adaptation]].{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}} The term DNA is also used to describe an organization's ability to [[innovation|innovate]].{{sfn|Galt|2010}}{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=15}}

In ''Corporate Culture: The Ultimate Strategic Asset'', Eric Flamholtz and Yvonne Randle state that organization culture is "transmitted to generations of employees" via that organization's DNA,{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=18}} and that the DNA of the culture of the company is established "during its initial stages" reflecting the "personal and professional values" of the founders.{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=18}} They also state that it can be "transformed through the entrance of new people with new ideas",{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=194}} and that significant differences in organizational performance can be derived from small changes in organizational DNA.{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=24}} According to Virginia Healy-Tangney, such changes must come throughout the organization and are time-consuming.{{sfn|Healy-Tangney|2013}} These changes may result in increased [[productivity]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], and in a reduction of [[Turnover (employment)|employee turnover]].{{sfn|Asplund|Blacksmith|2012}}

Preservation of organizational DNA is important to ensure business continuity and persistence. Organizations have implemented various techniques to prevent organizational DNA from being controlled by external influences, such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] remaining [[Privately held company|privately owned]] to limit control of [[share capital]].{{sfn|Nurdin|2011|p=180}} Another method is by branding corporate work environments to "clearly reflect the culture" of the organization.{{sfn|Haynes|2012}}

&lt;!-- this needs better phrasing --&gt;
DNA is used to describe the skills, properties, or qualities of an individual that describe that individual's character.{{sfn|Dyer|Gregersen|Christensen|2011}}
{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011}}

The term is also used to describe the set of architectural and spatial characteristics considered by the [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitants]] of a city to be constituents of that city's [[Cultural identity|identity]].{{sfn|Crowhurst Lennard|Lennard|1995|p=7}} This may include "materials and colours, a typical arrangement of scale and architectural forms, building lot size, roof lines, scale of public and semi-public spaces" which should be respected by new buildings and urban spaces in the city.{{sfn|Crowhurst Lennard|Lennard|1995|p=7}} In an article in ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', Kelli Richards claims that the organizational culture at [[Apple Inc.]] in the 1990s has become part of the DNA of [[Silicon Valley]].{{sfn|Richards|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4519">'''Cultural deprivation''' is a theory in [[sociology]] where a person has inferior norms, values, skills and knowledge. The theory states that people of the working class experience cultural deprivation and this disadvantages them, as a result of which the gap between classes increases. 

For example, in education,  lower-class students suffer from cultural deprivation as their parents do not know the best school for their child but middle-class parents know the system and so send their children to the best school for them. This puts the lower-class students at a disadvantage, thus increasing inequality and the gap between middle-class and lower-class students. 

Proponents of this theory argue that [[working class culture]] (regardless of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[gender]], [[ethnicity]] or other factors) inherently differs from that of people in the [[middle class]]. This difference in culture means that while middle-class children can easily acquire cultural capital by observing their parents, working-class children cannot, and this deprivation is [[self-perpetuating]].

The theory claims that the middle class gains cultural capital as the result of primary socialization, while the working class does not. Cultural capital helps the middle class succeed in society because their norms and values facilitate educational achievement and subsequent [[employability]]. Working class members of society that lack cultural capital do not pass it on to their children, perpetuating the class system.{{sfn|Willis|1977}} Middle-class children's cultural capital allows them to communicate with their middle-class teachers more effectively than working-class children and this contributes to social inequality.{{sfn|Morais|Neves|Davies|Daniels|2001}}

[[Bourdieu]] claimed that state schools are set up to make everybody middle class, although only the middle class and some high achieving working class have the cultural capital to achieve this.{{sfn|Webb|Schirato|Danaher|2002}} From a [[Marxist]] perspective cultural deprivation observes that the resources available to the working class are limited and that working-class children enter school less-well prepared than others.

In July 2009 Nasution was appointed Senior Deputy Governor of [[Bank Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Decree No.57/P 2009, dated 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sworn into office on 27 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/28/darmin-acting-governor-bi.html Darmin acting governor of BI'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasution immediately became acting governor of Bank Indonesia because the previous governor, [[Boediono]], had resigned several months earlier in May to run for election as Vice President of Indonesia as team mate of President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 38/P, 2009, on 19 May 2009 regarding the resignation of [[Boediono]] as governor of Bank Indonesia, as well as legislated by Act No. 23, 1999, concerning Bank Indonesia and amended by Act No. 6, 2009, the senior deputy governor, Darmin Nasution, took on the position of acting governor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasution was subsequently appointed as Governor of Bank Indonesia on September 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with Presidential Decree No.95 / P of 2010 dated August 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; after parliamentary hearings to consider his nomination as governor.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/23/darmin-finally-named-bi-governor.html Darmin finally named BI governor'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as governor when [[Agus Martowardojo]] was appointed in May 2013.

== Coordinating Economics Minister ==
On August 12, 2015, in a cabinet reshuffle by President [[Joko Widodo]], Nasution was appointed as the Coordinating Minister of Economics, replacing [[Sofyan Djalil]] in the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia’s President Widodo reshuffles cabinet to boost slowing economy|date=12 August 2015|first1= |last1= |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Woo''' is the Head of Global Interest Rates, Foreign Exchange, Emerging Market Fixed Income &amp; Economics Research at [[Bank of America|Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], where he researches the world financial markets. He is considered one of the leading macro investment strategists today – he is a regular guest on [[CNBC]] and [[Bloomberg TV]] and was voted as one of the twelve smartest people on Wall Street in 2013 by [[Business Insider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-smartest-people-on-wall-street-2013-6?op=1|title=The 12 Smartest People On Wall Street|date=1 June 2013|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=As head of global rates and currencies research at BAML, David Woo has to keep track of a lot of different things at once – and for those interested in global macro, Woo's perspective is a must-read. Recently, he flagged developments across major world markets as inconsistent, warning of a global slowdown and a major market re-alignment. Woo remains cautious on the outlook for the U.S. economy in the short term, along with its implication for risk assets. However, he says that if the economy begins to improve along the lines of what stocks are already pricing in, then the euro could be the biggest beneficiary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo is known for his contrarian calls on the [[United States elections, 2016]],&lt;ref name=Gurdusl2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/08/bofaml-analyst-got-ovation-from-co-workers-the-morning-after-election.html|title=Merrill Lynch analyst got a standing ovation from 300 of his co-workers the morning after the election for nailing what would happen|last=Gurdus|first=Elizabeth|date=8 December 2016|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=8 December 2016|quote=Woo said markets were failing to accurately price in the probability of a Trump win, almost treating the election as a "nonevent."

So says David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. While some question the existence of any conflict -- arguing that falling exchange rates merely reflect efforts by central banks to spur lackluster domestic economies -- Woo expresses concern. “There is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,” he said in a report to clients this week. “The reason why this is a war is that it is ultimately a zero-sum game -- someone gains only because someone else will lose.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2015-16 devaluation of the [[renminbi]],&lt;ref name=Adinolfi2015/&gt; [[Bitcoin]],&lt;ref name=Weisenthal2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alden2013/&gt; and the future of the [[Euro]].&lt;ref name=Nixon2012/&gt;

== The 2016 US election ==
In September 2016, Woo said "markets were failing to adequately price in the probability of a Trump win"&lt;ref name=Gurdusl2016/&gt; and predicted that "if Trump won, it would bring about a stronger dollar and higher rates thanks to fiscal stimulus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/strategist-if-trump-wins-the-u-s-economy-would-take-off-in-a-big-way|title='Strategist: If Trump Wins, 'The U.S. Economy Would Take Off in a Big Way'|last=Kawa|first=Luke|date=12 September 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=12 September 2016|quote=David Woo says investors are still underestimating the real estate mogul's chances of ascending to the highest office in the land, and what a seismic change this could be for markets and the world's largest economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency war ==
In February 2015, Woo predicted that the world was heading into a currency war due to "diminished stigma" and the fact that "inaction automatically entails loss. "If everyone's playing this game you have no choice but to play it, because otherwise you get left behind," he said. Woo called currency war a "zero sum game".&lt;ref name=Sidibe|2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedyl2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/03/bofa-strategist-currency-war-to-be-lose-lose-game.html|title='Currency war' to be 'lose-lose' game: Strategist|last=Cox|first=Jeff|date=3 February 2015|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=3 February 2015|quote=The world is heading toward a global currency war that Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist David Woo said ultimately will have no winners.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 2015-16 renminbi devaluation ==
As early as April 2015, Woo argued that the renminbi was set to fall because "China cannot allow for looser capital flows while maintaining its monetary policy targets, which include limiting the yuan's moves against the US dollar.&lt;ref name=Adinolfi2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-one-of-wall-streets-top-analysts-is-betting-against-the-yuan-2015-04-27|title=Why one of Wall Street’s top analysts is betting against the yuan - MarketWatch|last=Adinolfi|first=Joseph|date=27 April 2015|publisher=[[MarketWatch]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=In a note to clients, David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of America Merrill, said China cannot allow for looser capital flows while maintaining its monetary-policy targets, which include limiting the yuan’s moves against the U.S. dollar.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the August 2015 renminbi devaluation, Woo predicted the renminbi could decline further by as much as 10% against the dollar in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-04/boring-wall-street-analyst-notes-are-out-bold-and-funny-are-in|title=Boring Wall Street Analyst Notes Are Out. Bold, Funny Are In|last=Nguyen|first=Lananh|date=4 December 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=4 December 2016|quote=In "The Great Divorce," published in November 2015, Woo outlined the biggest call of his career, arguing that China’s currency could tumble as much as 10 percent against the dollar in 2016. The estimate was the fourth-most pessimistic of more than 40 forecasts. The onshore yuan has fallen more than 7 percent since, reaching an eight-year low last month and leaving rival strategists racing to catch up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo also argued that this would have global repercussions, including a "shallower Fed cycle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-23/bank-of-america-the-great-divorce-between-the-world-s-two-largest-economies-will-drive-currency-and-rates-markets-in-2016|title=Bank of America: The 'Great Divorce' Between the World's Two Largest Economies Will Drive Currency and Rates Markets in 2016|last=Kawa|first=Luke|date=23 November 2015|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=23 November 2015|quote=The strategist believes that the Federal Reserve's terminal rate—the ceiling for how high its policy rate will go—will be dragged down by the decline in China's currency..}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawa2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-americas-woo-china-still-120303858.html|title=Bank of America's Woo: "China Is Still More Important Than The Fed" - Yahoo Finance|last=Kawa|first=Luke|date=6 October 2015|publisher=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Woo called the Chinese equity rally the "world’s largest bubble since dot-com boom of the late 1990s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/24/meet-the-worlds-biggest-stock-market-bubble-since-the-dot-com-boom/|title=Meet the world’s biggest stock market bubble since the dot-com boom|last=Swanson|first=Ana|date=24 June 2015|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=No other stock market has ever grown this much in dollar terms over a 12-month period. David Woo, the head of Global Rates and Currencies Research at Bank of America, has called it the world’s largest stock market bubble since the dot-com boom of the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and predicted that Chinese shares "may drop as much as 30%", and creating a "knock-on effect on the whole world economy."&lt;ref name=Hu2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/why-bofa-s-global-bond-guru-is-fixated-on-china-s-equity-bubble |title=Why BofA’s Global Bond Guru Is Fixated on Chinese Equities |last1=Hu |first1=Fox |last2=Keene |first2=Tom |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |accessdate=14 October 2015 |quote=Woo said China’s rally has become so big -- he called it the world’s largest bubble since dot-com boom of the late 1990s -- that the eventual collapse will have consequences for markets around the world. Chinese shares may drop as much as 30 percent when the mania ends, weighing on consumers who have been an important driver of growth in Asia’s largest economy, Woo said. He expects the selloff will be bullish for the dollar and U.S. Treasuries. It will have a “knock on effect on the whole world economy,” Woo said. “The only thing that’s holding up the Chinese economy are the Chinese consumers right now. The Chinese consumers are all involved in the Chinese stock market.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bitcoin ==
In December 2013, Woo argued that [[Bitcoin]] "can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers", an opinion that Joe Weisenthal said "represents a top-fligh kappat mind at a major financial institution assessing it in a serious way, and coming to the conclusion that it could be the real deal."&lt;ref name=Weisenthal2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/david-woo-on-bitcoin-2013-12|title=David Woo On Bitcoin|last=Weisenthal|first=Joe|date=5 December 2013|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alden2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/for-bitcoin-a-setback-in-china-and-an-endorsement-on-wall-street/?_r=0|title=For Bitcoin, a Setback in China and an Endorsement on Wall Street|last=Alden|first=William|date=5 December 2013|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Woo put the upper bound of Bitcoin’s fair value at $1300,&lt;ref name=Lopez2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-bitcoin-bofa-merrill-lynch-20131206-story.html|title=Bitcoin has clear 'potential for growth,' currency analyst says|last=Lopez|first=Ricardo|date=6 December 2013|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "Bitcoin is highly volatile, the result of speculation activities, and that's hindering its general acceptance as a form of payment."&lt;ref name=Lopez2013/&gt;

== The 2012 European debt crisis ==
In July 2012, in a cost-benefit analysis of whether individual members of the Eurozone should stay with the euro, David Woo and Athanasios Vamvakidis argued that “Italy and Ireland emerge as the countries with the greatest incentive to exit.” They concluded that a much weaker euro was necessary to reduce the incentive of any country to exit.&lt;ref name=Nixon2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303644004577523090813458030|title=Italy and Germany's Endgame for the Euro|last=Nixon|first=Simon|date=12 July 2012|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=14 October 2015|quote=The risk of a euro-zone breakup may actually be rising rather than falling, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists David Woo and Athanasios Vamvakidis. Using game theory to consider how the situation might evolve, they believe the crisis will boil down to a game of bluff between Italy and Germany in which neither country has an incentive to back down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== US energy independence and the dollar ==
In March 2013, Woo argued that "rising U.S. crude oil and natural gas production will likely lift the American greenback against major currencies" by shrinking the US current account deficit, boosting investment and reducing the correlation between the dollar and oil prices.&lt;ref name=Hussain2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/energy-boom-bullish-for-u-s-dollar-baml-analyst|title=Energy boom bullish for U.S. dollar: BAML analyst|last=Hussain|first=Yadhullah|date=11 March 2013|publisher=[[Financial Post]]|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Den of Thieves''''' is a bestselling [[1992 in literature|1992]] [[non-fiction]] book by [[Pulitzer prize]]-winning writer [[James B. Stewart]].

==Overview==
''Den of Thieves'' recounts the [[insider trading]] scandals involving [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Michael Milken]], and other [[Wall Street]] financiers in the United States during the 1980s, such as [[Robert M. Freeman|Robert Freeman]], [[Dennis Levine]], [[Lowell Milken]], [[John A. Mulheren]], [[Martin Siegel]], [[Timothy Tabor]], [[Richard Wigton]], [[Robert Wilkis]], and others. There have been eight editions as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Worldcat|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24214127&amp;referer=brief_results |title=''Den of Thieves'', brief results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1972.Den_of_Thieves|title= ''Den of Thieves'' description|author=Stewart, James B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intertwining the stories of financiers, bankers, lawyers, and the law enforcement officials who pursued them, ''Den of Thieves'' tells a tale of arrogance and complacency amongst the [[Wall Street]] elite. As [[leveraged buyouts]] and [[takeovers]] proliferated in the heady 1980s, information on which companies were being targeted became ever more valuable. The stock price of companies could rise enormously on rumors of a potential takeover. Those who were privy to that information before it became public could make huge sums of money. Stewart shows how some of the biggest names in American financial history were involved in one of the greatest insider-trading schemes ever and how their exposure and punishment sent shock waves through corporate America.

{{Expert needed|Databases|date=June 2009}}

A '''dimension''' is a structure that categorizes [[Fact (data warehouse)|facts]] and [[Measure (data warehouse)|measures]] in order to enable users to answer business questions. Commonly used dimensions are people, products, place and time.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96520/dimensio.htm#11840 Oracle Data Warehousing Guide]", Oracle Corporation, retrieved 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/dimension Definition: Dimension]" Search Data Management, TechTarget, retrieved 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[data warehouse]], dimensions provide structured labeling information to otherwise unordered numeric measures.  The dimension is a [[data set]] composed of individual, non-overlapping [[data element]]s.  The primary functions of dimensions are threefold: to provide filtering, grouping and labelling.

These functions are often described as "slice and dice".   A common data warehouse example involves sales as the measure, with customer and product as dimensions.  In each sale a customer buys a product.  The data can be sliced by removing all customers except for a group under study, and then diced by grouping by product.

A dimensional [[data element]] is similar to a [[categorical variable]] in statistics.

Typically dimensions in a data warehouse are organized internally into one or more hierarchies.  "Date" is a common dimension, with several possible hierarchies:

* "Days (are grouped into) Months (which are grouped into) Years",
* "Days (are grouped into) Weeks (which are grouped into) Years"
* "Days (are grouped into) Months (which are grouped into) Quarters (which are grouped into) Years"
* etc.

==Types==
===Conformed dimension===
A conformed dimension is a set of data attributes that have been physically referenced in multiple database tables using the same key value to refer to the same structure, attributes, domain values, definitions and concepts. A conformed dimension cuts across many facts.

Dimensions are conformed when they are either exactly the same (including keys) or one is a perfect subset of the other.  Most important, the row headers produced in two different answer sets from the same conformed dimension(s) must be able to match perfectly.'

Conformed dimensions are either identical or strict mathematical subsets of the most granular, detailed dimension. Dimension tables are not conformed if the attributes are labeled differently or contain different values. Conformed dimensions come in several different flavors.  At the most basic level, conformed dimensions mean exactly the same thing with every possible fact table to which they are joined.  The date dimension table connected to the sales facts is identical to the date dimension connected to the inventory facts.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kimball, Margy Ross, The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, Second Edition, Wiley Computer Publishing, 2002.  {{ISBN|0471-20024-7}}, Pages 82-87, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junk dimension===
A junk dimension is a convenient grouping of typically low-cardinality flags and indicators.  By creating an abstract dimension, these flags and indicators are removed from the fact table while placing them into a useful dimensional framework.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kimball, Margy Ross, The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, Second Edition, Wiley Computer Publishing, 2002.  {{ISBN|0471-20024-7}}, Pages 202, 405&lt;/ref&gt;
A Junk Dimension is a dimension table consisting of attributes that do not belong in the fact table or in any of the existing dimension tables. The nature of these attributes is usually text or various flags, e.g. non-generic comments or just simple yes/no or true/false indicators. These kinds of attributes are typically remaining when all the obvious dimensions in the business process have been identified and thus the designer is faced with the challenge of where to put these attributes that do not belong in the other dimensions.

One solution is to create a new dimension for each of the remaining attributes, but due to their nature, it could be necessary to create a vast number of new dimensions resulting in a fact table with a very large number of foreign keys. The designer could also decide to leave the remaining attributes in the fact table but this could make the row length of the table unnecessarily large if, for example, the attributes is a long text string.

The solution to this challenge is to identify all the attributes and then put them into one or several Junk Dimensions. One Junk Dimension can hold several true/false or yes/no indicators that have no correlation with each other, so it would be convenient to convert the indicators into a more describing attribute. An example would be an indicator about whether a package had arrived: instead of indicating this as “yes” or “no”, it would be converted into “arrived” or “pending” in the junk dimension. The designer can choose to build the dimension table so it ends up holding all the indicators occurring with every other indicator so that all combinations are covered. This sets up a fixed size for the table itself which would be 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; rows, where ''x'' is the number of indicators. This solution is appropriate in situations where the designer would expect to encounter a lot of different combinations and where the possible combinations are limited to an acceptable level. In a situation where the number of indicators are large, thus creating a very big table or where the designer only expect to encounter a few of the possible combinations, it would be more appropriate to build each row in the junk dimension as new combinations are encountered. To limit the size of the tables, multiple junk dimensions might be appropriate in other situations depending on the correlation between various indicators.

Junk dimensions are also appropriate for placing attributes like non-generic comments from the fact table. Such attributes might consist of data from an optional comment field when a customer places an order and as a result will probably be blank in many cases. Therefore, the junk dimension should contain a single row representing the blanks as a surrogate key that will be used in the fact table for every row returned with a blank comment field&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Ralph, ''et al.'' (2008): The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, Second Edition, Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, IN. Pages 263-265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate dimension===
A degenerate dimension is a key, such as a transaction number, invoice number, ticket number, or bill-of-lading number, that has no attributes and hence does not join to an actual dimension table. Degenerate dimensions are very common when the grain of a fact table represents a single transaction item or line item because the degenerate dimension represents the unique identifier of the parent. Degenerate dimensions often play an integral role in the fact table's primary key.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kimball, Margy Ross, The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, Second Edition, Wiley Computer Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0471-20024-7}}, Pages 50, 398&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role-playing dimension===
Dimensions are often recycled for multiple applications within the same database.  For instance, a "Date" dimension can be used for "Date of Sale", as well as "Date of Delivery", or "Date of Hire".  This is often referred to as a "role-playing dimension".

==Use of ISO representation terms==
When referencing data from a metadata registry such as [[ISO/IEC 11179]], [[representation term]]s such as "Indicator" (a boolean true/false value), "Code" (a set of non-overlapping enumerated values) are typically used as dimensions.  For example, using the [[National Information Exchange Model]] (NIEM) the data element name would be "PersonGenderCode" and the enumerated values might be "male2, "female" and "unknown".

==Dimension table==
In [[data warehousing]], a '''dimension table''' is one of the set of companion tables to a [[fact table]].

The fact table contains [[business fact]]s (or ''measures''), and [[foreign key]]s which refer to [[candidate key]]s (normally [[primary key]]s) in the dimension tables.

Contrary to ''fact'' tables, ''dimension'' tables contain descriptive attributes (or fields) that are typically textual fields (or discrete numbers that behave like text). These attributes are designed to serve two critical purposes: query constraining and/or filtering, and query result set labeling.

Dimension attributes should be:
* Verbose (labels consisting of full words)
* Descriptive
* Complete (having no missing values)
* Discretely valued (having only one value per dimension table row)
* Quality assured (having no misspellings or impossible values)

Dimension table rows are uniquely identified by a single key field. It is recommended that the key field be a simple integer because a key value is meaningless, used only for joining fields between the fact and dimension tables. Dimension tables often use primary keys that are also surrogate keys. Surrogate keys are often auto-generated (e.g. a Sybase or SQL Server "identity column", a PostgreSQL or Informix serial, an Oracle SEQUENCE or a column defined with AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL).

The use of surrogate dimension keys brings several advantages, including:
* Performance. Join processing is made much more efficient by using a single field (the [[surrogate key]])
* Buffering from operational key management practices. This prevents situations where removed data rows might reappear when their natural keys get reused or reassigned after a long period of dormancy
* Mapping to integrate disparate sources
* Handling unknown or not-applicable connections
* Tracking changes in dimension attribute values

Although surrogate key use places a burden put on the [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] system, pipeline processing can be improved, and ETL tools have built-in improved surrogate key processing.

The goal of a dimension table is to create standardized, conformed dimensions that can be shared across the enterprise's data warehouse environment, and enable joining to multiple fact tables representing various business processes.

Conformed dimensions are important to the enterprise nature of DW/BI systems because they promote:
* Consistency. Every fact table is filtered consistently, so that query answers are labeled consistently.
* Integration. Queries can drill into different process fact tables separately for each individual fact table, then join the results on common dimension attributes.
* Reduced development time to market. The common dimensions are available without recreating them.

Over time, the attributes of a given row in a dimension table may change. For example, the shipping address for a company may change.  [[Ralph Kimball|Kimball]] refers to this phenomenon as [[Slowly Changing Dimension]]s.  Strategies for dealing with this kind of change are divided into three categories:
* Type One. Simply overwrite the old value(s).
* Type Two. Add a new row containing the new value(s), and distinguish between the rows using [[Tuple-versioning]] techniques.
* Type Three. Add a new attribute to the existing row.

==Common patterns==
;Date and time&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kimball, The Data Warehouse Toolkit, Second Edition, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2008.  {{ISBN|978-0-470-14977-5}}, Pages 253-256&lt;/ref&gt;
Since many [[fact table]]s in a data warehouse are time series of observations, one or more date dimensions are often needed. One of the reasons to have date dimensions is to place calendar knowledge in the data warehouse instead of hard-coded in an application. While a simple SQL date/timestamp is useful for providing accurate information about the time a fact was recorded, it can not give information about holidays, fiscal periods, etc. An SQL date/timestamp can still be useful to store in the fact table, as it allows for precise calculations.

Having both the date and time of day in the same dimension, may easily result in a huge dimension with millions of rows. If a high amount of detail is needed it is usually a good idea to split date and time into two or more separate dimensions. A time dimension with a grain of seconds in a day will only have 86400 rows. A more or less detailed grain for date/time dimensions can be chosen depending on needs. As examples, date dimensions can be accurate to year, quarter, month or day and time dimensions can be accurate to hours, minutes or seconds.

As a rule of thumb, time of day dimension should only be created if hierarchical groupings are needed or if there are meaningful textual descriptions for periods of time within the day (ex. “evening rush” or “first shift”).

If the rows in a fact table are coming from several timezones, it might be useful to store date and time in both local time and a standard time. This can be done by having two dimensions for each date/time dimension needed – one for local time, and one for standard time. Storing date/time in both local and standard time, will allow for analysis on when facts are created in a local setting and in a global setting as well. The standard time chosen can be a global standard time (ex. [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), it can be the local time of the business’ headquarter, or any other time zone that would make sense to use.

'''Dmitri Vladimirovich Kovtun''' ({{lang-ru|Дмитрий Владимирович Ковтун}}; b. 1965) is a Russian businessman and ex-[[KGB]] agent who met the poisoned ex-spy [[Alexander Litvinenko]] several times in [[London]], the last time hours before Litvinenko fell ill. Kovtun was hospitalised with radiation poisoning in [[Moscow]].

==Early life and education==
Kovtun hails from a military family.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt;  He attended the elite Soviet military command academy in Moscow in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt; [[Andrei Lugovoi]] is his childhood friend and classmate.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Kovtun and Lugovoi began to serve at the KGB's ninth directorate that was charged with the protection of top Kremlin officials.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt; After the collapse of [[the USSR]], they became involved in the security business.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt; He is also a business consultant.&lt;ref name=finn&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Tied to Ex-Spy Also Ill From Radiation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120700604.html|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 December 2006|author=Peter Finn|author2=Mary Jordan|location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation investigation===
Kovtun met the poisoned ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko in London on several occasions, first in mid-October and later only hours before Litvinenko fell ill on 1 November. On 9 December 2006, German police report finding traces of radiation at [[Hamburg]] flat used by Kovtun.&lt;ref name="hamburg_radiation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Radiation 'trace' at Hamburg flat|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=19 December 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6163667.stm|accessdate=9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German investigators, the [[polonium]] traces were found on a couch where Kovtun is believed to have slept at his ex-wife's apartment in [[Hamburg]] ([[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]-Ottensen) the night before he headed to London for a meeting with Litvinenko and according to British investigators, polonium traces were found on the airplanes in which Kovtun traveled between Moscow and London. Polonium traces were also found in Kovtun's car in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German police confirm polonium traces|publisher=AP|date=11 December 2006|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061211/ap_on_re_eu/poisoned_spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Russian and British investigators have interviewed Kovtun. Furthermore, German detectives investigated Kovtun's suspected participation to plutonium smuggling into [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="bbc_interpol"/&gt; Germany dropped the case against Kovtun on November 2009.

Kovtun was hospitalised in Moscow with radiation poisoning at the beginning of December 2006.&lt;ref name=finn/&gt; On 12 December 2006, he told Russia's Channel One TV that his "health was improving."&lt;ref name="bbc_interpol"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interpol joins Litvinenko inquiry|publisher=BBC|date=13 December 2006|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6172765.stm|accessdate=14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovtun said that he had only one explanation for the presence of polonium: "It is that I brought it back from London, where I met Alexander Litvinenko on October 16, 17 and 18."&lt;ref name="bbc_interpol"/&gt; British detectives, on the other hand, believe Litvinenko was not contaminated until the meeting on 1 November.

Various theories of Dmitry Kovtun involvement have been progressed in the media. One theory is he may be the [[murderer]] or an accomplice  of one of the murderers of Alexander Litvinenko and mishandling the substance used, [[polonium-210]].

===Accusation===
[[Crown Prosecution Service|The Crown Prosecution Service]] accused Kovtun as being the second suspect of murdering Alexander Litvinenko based on the discovery of new evidence in 2011 and requested his extradition to England to stand trial in February 2012.&lt;ref name=harding&gt;{{cite news|last=Harding|first=Luke|title=Alexander Litvinenko poisoning: move to extradite second murder suspect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/29/alexander-litvinenko-polonium-suspect-charged|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2015, Kovtun appeared on ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' and announced that he would testify, by video-link, to the enquiry into Litvinenko's death. He told the BBC he had "heard a lot of statements which are easy to refute" and by participating he could "get access to the documents - including the secret material - so I can make my own conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32006475]&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 2017 blacklisting==
On 9 January 2017, under the [[Magnitsky Act]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] updated its Specially Designated Nationals List and blacklisted [[Alexander Bastrykin|Aleksandr I. Bastrykin]], [[Andrey Lugovoy|Andrei K. Lugovoi]], Dmitri V.

The '''Dubai International Financial Centre''' ('''DIFC''') is a [[special economic zone]] in [[Dubai]] covering 110 [[Hectare|ha]], established in 2004 and a financial hub for the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) markets. DIFC has its own independent, internationally regulated regulator and judicial system, common law framework, global financial exchange, tax-friendly regime, and a large business community. The district houses hundreds of financial institutions, including wealth funds and private investors, but it also hosts multinationals, retail outlets, cafés, restaurants, residential space, public green spaces, hotels and art galleries.

DIFC is one of Dubai's independent free-zones; it offers companies 100% ownership without the need for a local partner. The district is governed by a common-law framework distinct from the UAE legal system, with laws and regulations issued in English. DIFC offers clients a 50-year guarantee of zero taxes on corporate income and profits, complemented by the UAE’s network of double taxation avoidance treaties.

==Independent jurisdiction==
The DIFC is an independent jurisdiction under the UAE Constitution, with its own civil and commercial laws distinct from those of the wider UAE. DIFC laws and regulations are written in English and default to [[English law]] in the event of an ambiguity. The DIFC also has its own courts, with judges taken from leading common law jurisdictions including England, Singapore and Hong Kong. The DIFC’s independent jurisdiction extends to a range of areas including corporate, commercial, civil, employment, trusts, and securities law matters. Other laws of the UAE or the Emirate of Dubai, such as criminal law and immigration regulations, continue to apply within the DIFC.

The DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre is an independent centre of international arbitration that uses rules modelled on the [[London Court of International Arbitration]].

The principal governing body of the DIFC is the DIFC Authority. The financial services regulator is the [[Dubai Financial Services Authority]] (DFSA), which regulates the conduct of financial services in and from the DIFC. The DFSA is distinct from the UAE’s federal Securities and Commodities Authority, whose jurisdiction covers the wider UAE outside the boundaries of the DIFC.

==International financial centre==
Licence applications are considered from financial institutions in the sectors. The  units offer benefits such as 0% tax on income and profits, 100% foreign ownership, no restrictions on foreign exchange or capital/profit repatriation, operational support and business continuity facilities.

One of the key elements of the centre is a privately held financial exchange that opened in September 2005 as Dubai International Financial Exchange (DIFX) but was rebranded as [[NASDAQ Dubai]] in the year 2008.

The trading hours of NASDAQ Dubai are from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm (06:00 am to 10:00 am GMT), from Sunday to Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaqdubai.com/investors/index.html |title=NASDAQ Dubai |publisher=NASDAQ Dubai |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies listed on NASDAQ Dubai include ordinary shares listed by [[DP World]] along with DEPA. DP World's [[initial public offering]] was the largest ever in the Middle East and raised $4.96 billion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/139871.html |title=Clifford Chance advises on the largest ever IPO in the Middle East &amp;#124; Clifford Chance |publisher=AMEinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 times oversubscribed, it is one of the most valued companies in the Middle East Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/2007/11/21231016/DP-World-nets-49bn-in-region.html |title=DP World nets $4.9bn in region’s biggest IPO - Money Matters |publisher=livemint.com |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamic Business Modeling''' ("DBM") describes the ability to automate [[business model]]s within an open framework. The independent analyst firm [[Gartner]] has recently called Dynamic Business Modeling "critical for [[Business Support Systems|BSS]] solutions to succeed".

Dynamic Business Modeling is based on principles wherein the [[business logic]] of an [[Application software|application]] is managed independently from the [[application server]]s that automate the services and processes defined in the business logic. Business modeling and integration (which itself is defined as part of the business model) are defined in a business logic layer, allowing underlying application servers to be business logic agnostic and therefore need no business driven customization. DBM applied correctly should reduce both the cost and risk in the initial implementation and its future evolution of systems.

Previous generations of IT systems (from 1990 to approximately 2001) were designed to address specific business models and regulatory practices and no value was given to [[logic]]–[[infrastructure]] segregation.  These systems provided value by automating predefined business models (commonly referred to as "off-the-shelf").  As a result, they implicitly drove [[business strategy]] where DBM states that they should be driven by it.  By being "predefined" they do not:

* openly incorporate business changes in the business landscape of an industry
* leverage potential business models that new technologies allow

Dynamic Business modeling is suited for open automation of strategy-driven business models. By removing the need for customization of core application servers it is postulated as more [[Cost efficiency|cost efficient]], rapidly deployed and evolveable. Dynamic Business Modeling was initially described (though applied much earlier in practice) by Doug Zone at MetraTech Corp. in reference to the billing segment of the enterprise software market.  "Service Oriented Applications" (also known as "service based applications") coined by IBM describe potential methodologies to achieve DBM.

==Technical definition ==

Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the automation of Enterprise Business Models based on the principle that the model's underlying [[business process]]es and business services need to be dynamically and openly definable and re-definable.

==Business definition ==

Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the enabler of a strategic advantage achieved by focused [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] in any aspect of business (from marketing to finance to operations). This differentiation is achieved through how business is conducted: openly and dynamically defining the business model.  [[Capital investment]] – human, physical and intellectual – must be aimed at allowing the definition of the business model to be dynamic.

Dynamic Business Modeling recognises that businesses dynamically evolve, re-inventing their (business) models to achieve strategic advantage. DBM posits that the role of [[enterprise software]] (CRM, billing, ERP) is to dynamically automate and advance the business processes and services that lie behind these Business models.

==History==

The term was first used to describe the architecture of MetraNet, a [[wiktionary:Charging|charging]], [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing, [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]] and [[customer care]] from [[MetraTech]] Corp.

==Core principles ==

# Business strategy drives selection of business models.
# These business models drive the design of underlying processes and services.
#* ''Business Analysis is critical: Any number of models can address a strategic imperative. But the best models, services and processes will exploit existing business capabilities (human, IT and physical), the areas where change is possible and the areas where [[investment]] will make most change possible at the lowest cost.''
# Enterprise software automates these services and processes.
# DBM enables change: Strategic adeptness requires tuning and/or the re-definition of the present Business Model.
#* ''The business must begin with the principle that allows rapid tuning and/or re-definition of the underlying services and processes. This must apply at human and technological levels''.

==Key success criteria ==

# Open modeling capabilities:
#* ''Dynamic Business Modeling requires [[IT architecture]] and [[enterprise application]]s that automate the business model  – not just a business model.''
# Ease of modeling:
#* ''Definition and [[automation]] of new and evolved business services and processes must be accessible at the [[business analysis]] level.  Ideally the models and its services and processes are defined and stored in open [[business analyst]] oriented data (for example [[metadata]].)''
# Open integration:
#* ''Dynamic Business Modeling must work with processes and services (both automated and human) that are NOT dynamic. These fixed constraints are not external to the new business model but are part of its fabric. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be able to incorporate, embed and/or build upon these existing processes and services.''
# Robustness:
#* ''Regardless of the dynamism of the business model. The automated and human-based business processes and services must have all the robustness of long standing static processes and services.  Dynamic IT automation must have a full [[audit]] capability, reprocessing ability and standards compliance (i.e. PCI).''
# Perpetual dynamism:
#* ''Automation is never finished. Processes and services change and are added constantly. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be designed to prevent “lock down” where the service and process automation on “Day One” is so tightly coupled that only minor evolution is economic.  SOA principles of openness and loss coupling must be applied inside business applications.''

==Best practice ==

# DBM is service-based:
#* '' The application should be based on the principle that processes and integration can be de-constructed internally into services.''
# Services and processes are loosely coupled:
#* ''Changing one should not impact the others.''
# Services and process definitions are open:
#* ''And accessible to a business analyst. Ideally definitions are kept in metadata.''
# Application servers must be free of embedded business logic:
#* ''For services, processes, data, workflows alike.''
# Dynamic documentation is a feature:
#* ''As the model evolves the documentation must evolve as well. The application should allow the business analyst to document at service level and then generate a cohesive document that encompasses entire model.''
# Business Analyst Interface is friendly and flexible:
#* ''The application must provide a way to put the definition of services and processes in analyst terms – using universal concepts such as flows and tables. The interface should encourage documentation, warn on inconsistencies, and allow testing.''

The '''electronics industry,''' especially meaning [[consumer electronics]], emerged in the 20th century and has now become a global industry worth billions of dollars. Contemporary society uses all manner of electronic devices built in automated or semi-automated factories operated by the industry.  Products are assembled from [[integrated circuit]]s, principally by [[photolithography]] of [[printed circuit board]]s.

The size of the industry and the use of toxic materials, as well as the difficulty of recycling has led to a series of problems with [[electronic waste]]. International regulation and environmental legislation has been developed in an attempt to  address the issues.

== History ==
The [[electric power industry]] began in the 19th century and this led to the development of all manner of inventions.  [[Gramaphones|Gramophones]] were an early invention and this was followed by [[radio]] transmitters and receivers and televisions. The first [[digital computer]]s were built in the 1940s with a slow development in technology and total sales. In the 1970s and 1980s, the [[vacuum tube]], was largely supplanted by [[Semiconductor component|semiconductor components]] as the fundamental technology of the industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/exar-corp-history/|title=International Directory of Company Histories|last=|first=|publisher=St. James Press|year=1996|isbn=|volume=Vol. 14|location=|pages=|via=FundingUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the [[personal computer]] became popular. A large part of the electronics industry is now involved with [[digital technology]].

The industry now employs large numbers of [[electronics engineer]]s and [[electronics technician]]s to design, develop, test, manufacture, install, and repair electrical and electronic equipment such as communication equipment, medical monitoring devices, navigational equipment, and computers. Common parts manufactured are connectors, system components, cell systems, computer accessories, and these are made of alloy steel, copper, brass, stainless steel, plastic, steel tubing and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bracalente.com/markets/ Industries and Markets]", Bracalente Manufacturing Group, Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer electronics ==
[[Consumer electronics]] are products intended for everyday use, most often in [[entertainment]], [[communication]]s and [[office]] productivity.  [[Radio broadcasting]] in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the broadcast receiver.  Later products include [[personal computer]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, [[audio equipment]], [[television]]s, [[calculator]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[automotive electronics]], [[digital camera]]s and players and recorders using video media such as [[DVD]]s, [[VCR]]s or [[camcorder]]s. Increasingly these products have become based on digital technologies, and have largely merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to as the [[consumerization]] of [[information technology]].

The CEA ([[Consumer Electronics Association]]) estimated the value of 2017 consumer electronics sales at US$319 billion or INR ₹ 21,98,700cr..&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on the environment ==
Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials and up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics.
The United States and China are the world leaders in producing electronic waste, each tossing away about 3 million tons each year.&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=612&amp;ArticleID=6471|title=Urgent need to prepare developing countries for surges in E-Waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;   China also remains a major e-waste dumping ground for developed countries.&lt;ref name="unep.org"/&gt; The [[UNEP]] estimate that the amount of e-waste being produced - including mobile phones and computers - could rise by as much as 500 percent over the next decade in some  [[developing country|developing countries]], such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Section| first = United Nations News Service| title = As e-waste mountains soar, UN urges smart technologies to protect health| work = United Nations-DPI/NMD - UN News Service Section| accessdate = 2012-03-12| date = 2010-02-22| url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33845&amp;Cr=waste&amp;Cr1}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further|Electronic waste}}

Increasing environmental awareness has led to changes in electronics design to reduce or eliminate toxic materials and to reduce energy consumption. The [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE) were released by the [[European Commission]] in 2002.

{{Internet Marketing}}
'''Email marketing''' is the act of sending a [[commercial message]], typically to a group of people, using [[email]]. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current [[customer]] could be considered email [[marketing]]. It usually involves using email to send [[advertisement]]s, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build [[customer loyalty|loyalty]], trust, or [[brand awareness]]. Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant's relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads.

== History ==
Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century. Prior to this growth, when emails were novelties to the majority of customers, email marketing was not as effective. In 1978, Gary Thuerk of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) sent out the first [[mass email]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/spam#ref1072166|title=spam {{!}} unsolicited e-mail|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to approximately 400 potential clients via the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET). He claims that this resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Gina |title=Unsung innovators: Gary Thuerk, the father of spam |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2539767/cybercrime-hacking/unsung-innovators--gary-thuerk--the-father-of-spam.html |accessdate=30 October 2018 |work=Computerworld |date=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails. 

However, as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication, in the 1990s, users increasingly began referring to it as "[[email spam|spam]]", and began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs. In order to effectively communicate a message through email, marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user, without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software.

Historically, it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because [[target market]]s cannot be adequately defined. Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time, and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration, revealing a communication channel's scope. At the same time, however, it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods, such as television advertisements, cannot be captured.

==Types==
Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails:

=== Transactional emails ===
Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer's action with a company. To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages, these communications' primary purpose must be "to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender" along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUBLIC LAW 108–187—DEC. 16, 2003 117 STAT. 2699|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ187/pdf/PLAW-108publ187.pdf|publisher=U.S Government GPO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages, password reset emails, purchase or order confirmation emails, order status emails, reorder emails, and email receipts.

The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it. But, due to their high open rates (51.3% compared to 36.6% for email newsletters), transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers; to anticipate and answer questions; or to cross-sell or up-sell products or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ADIKESAVAN|first1=T.|title=MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS BEST PRACTICES AND APPLICATIONS IN BUSINESS|isbn=8120348966|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E7B2BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=The+primary+purpose+of+a+transactional+email+is+to+convey+information+regarding+the+action+that+triggered+it.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ddl9uJDdSe&amp;sig=JYuZBscLK_KedFxFL9edU7hxVGM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-uKfVe3ML4WryATVubTgAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw|access-date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support, which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails. There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services, which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns (such as [[Referral marketing|customer referral programs]]). {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Direct emails ===
Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message (for example, a special offer or a product catalog). Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to, or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Comparison to traditional mail==
There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional [[advertising mail]].

===Advantages===
Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons:
* Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail, mainly because with email, most of the cost falls on the recipient{{cn|date=August 2018}}. 
* Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP (email service provider) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients. The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of [[consumer behavior]]{{cn|date=August 2018}}.
* Almost half of American [[Internet]] users check or send email on a typical day,&lt;ref&gt;Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, [http://www.pewinternet.org/trends.asp "Tracking surveys"], March 2000 – March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailermailer.com/resources/metrics/2012/how-scheduling-affects-rates.rwp How Scheduling Affects Rates]. Mailermailer.com (July 2012). Retrieved on July 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''BtoB Magazine'', [http://www.btobonline.com/article/20110901/EMAIL13/309019997/early-morning-email-blasts-pay-off-with-strong-opens-clicks "Early Email Blasts Results in Higher Click &amp; Open Rates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122001746/http://www.btobonline.com/article/20110901/EMAIL13/309019997/early-morning-email-blasts-pay-off-with-strong-opens-clicks |date=2011-11-22 }}, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers. According to the report, legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73% in the U.S.; six percent were filtered as spam, and 22% were missing. This lags behind other countries: Australia delivers at 90%, Canada at 89%, Britain at 88%, France at 84%, Germany at 80% and Brazil at 79%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickz.com/email-deliverability-is-on-the-decline-report/104466/ Roberts, A. "Email deliverability is on the decline: report", ''ClickZ'']&lt;/ref&gt;

* Additionally, consumers receive on average about 90 emails per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf|title=Email Statistics Report, 2014-2018|last=Radicati|first= Sara|date=|website=The Radicati Group, Inc|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=proprietary and confidential research methodology; researcher has a product to sell|date=August 2018}}

* Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ([[CAN-SPAM]]),&lt;ref name=canspam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/canspam.htm|title=Consumer Information|author=|date=|website=Consumer Information|access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, or their [[Internet service provider]]'s [[acceptable use policy]].

==Opt-in email advertising==
[[Opt-in email]] advertising, or [[permission marketing]], is advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it. &lt;ref name="fairhead"&gt;Fairhead, N. (2003) "All hail the brave new world of permission marketing via email" (''Media'' 16, August 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm's customers. Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions, or new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Dilworth | first=Dianna | date=2007 | url=http://www.dmnews.com/Ruths-Chris-Steak-House-sends-sizzling-e-mails-for-special-occasions/article/94733/ | title=Ruth's Chris Steak House sends sizzling e-mails for special occasions | work=DMNews | access-date=February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of advertising, a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter.

With a foundation of opted-in contact information stored in their [[database]], marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using [[autoresponder]]s—known as [[drip marketing]]. They can also segment their promotions to specific [[market segmentation|market segments]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brian J. &amp; Montazemia, A. (2004) ''Management Information Systems'' (Canada: McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal requirements==

===Australia===
The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], widely known as "ACMA". The act defines the term ''unsolicited electronic messages'', states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information. Fines range with 3 fines of AU$110,000 being issued to [[Virgin Australia|Virgin Blue Airlines]] (2011), [[Tigerair Australia|Tiger Airways Holdings Limited]] (2012) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spam: enforcement actions|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/Citizen/Take-action/Complaints/Spam-complaints/spam-enforcement-actions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229024935/http://acma.gov.au/Citizen/Take-action/Complaints/Spam-complaints/spam-enforcement-actions|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 29, 2016|website=Australian Communications and Media Authority|publisher=Australian Communications and Media Authority|access-date=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The "Canada Anti-Spam Law" (CASL) went into effect on July 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/law-could-force-idle-brokers-back-to-dark-ages-72906.aspx|title=Law could force idle brokers back to dark ages|first=Bethan|last=Moorcraft|date=|website=Insurance Business|access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt-in from users, and the maximum fines for noncompliance are [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/home |title=Canada's law on spam|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=July 19, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union ===
In 2002 the [[European Union]] (EU) introduced the [[Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications]]. Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient; this does not apply to business email addresses.

The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states. In the UK it is covered under the [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20032426.htm The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114055417/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20032426.htm |date=November 14, 2006 }}. Opsi.gov.uk. Retrieved on July 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication.

===United States ===
The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] was passed by Congress as a direct response to the growing number of complaints over spam emails.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial emails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAN-SPAM Act: A Compliance Guide for Business|url=http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business|website=FTC.gov|publisher=BCP Business Center|access-date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are "materially false or misleading". In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format, their content and labeling. As a result, many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act. A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act. To comply with the act's regulation of commercial email, services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address, provide a one-click unsubscribe feature, and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In addition to satisfying legal requirements, email service providers (ESPs) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns. The service providers supply email templates and general best practices, as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically. Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers. They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened, and whether the recipients clicked on any [[Hyperlink|links]] within the messages.

The CAN-SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no-fee provision for opting out, further definition of "sender", post office or private mail boxes count as a "valid physical postal address" and definition of "person". These new provisions went into effect on July 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/05/canspam.shtm|title= FTC Approves New Rule Provision Under The CAN-SPAM Act|publisher= FTC.gov|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal_register_notices/definitions-and-implementation-under-can-spam-act-16-cfr-part-316/080521canspamact.pdf|title= 16 CFR Part 316 Definitions and Implementation Under the CAN–SPAM Act; Final Rule|publisher= FTC.gov|date=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HS Younger.JPG|thumb|Hans Stern upon arrival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]'''Hans Stern''' (October 1, 1922 &amp;ndash; October 26, 2007) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[jeweler]] and businessman. He was dubbed the "king of the colored gems" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and acclaimed by the international [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Essen]], [[Germany]], on October 1, 1922,&lt;ref name="BM"/&gt; Stern immigrated from [[Germany]] to [[Brazil]] at outbreak of [[World War II]]. Hans arrived in Brazil as a [[Jewish]] German immigrant when he was just 17 years old.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Hans Stern|url=http://legacy.dailysouthtown.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=APStory&amp;Id=13583|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Legacy.com|date=2007-10-29|accessdate=2007-11-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708221411/http://legacy.dailysouthtown.com/Obituaries.asp?Page=APStory&amp;Id=13583|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Stern started his career in the [[gemstone]] industry when he began working at the [[Rio de Janeiro]]-based company, [[Cristab]], which exports [[precious stones]] and [[mineral]]s from Brazil.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Stern traveled to [[Minas Gerais]] state as part of his job, where he came to know the local miners.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; He also became familiarized with many of the precious stones that were mined in the area, including [[topaz]]es, [[tourmaline]]s and [[amethyst]]s.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; He became fascinated by the vibrant gems of Brazil and decided to promote them internationally, targeting foreign travelers. In doing so, he gave birth to a new industry.

Stern founded his company, [[H. Stern]], in 1945, in order to market Brazilian gems&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; There was no real market for Brazilian gemstones  at the time.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; His company would eventually grow into a multinational jewelry empire. Stern and his company trained a large number of young Brazilian jewelers as H. Stern gained customers and market credibility.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; His work propelled the Brazilian jeweler industry up to international standards.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;  Stern was also the first to create a worldwide warranty certificate, and to offer tours of his workshops to present the creative and production process with integrity and transparency.  One of his main goals in life was achieved when important international gemological institutes revised the old "semi-precious" definition of colored stones and began referring to them since as "precious colored stones".  Stern coined the phrase, "There is no semi-precious stone as there is no semi-pregnant woman or semi-honest man".

Stern's company, H. Stern, grew into a retail chain of more than 160 stores throughout the world.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; The first international boutiques appeared in [[Frankfurt]], [[Lisbon]] and [[New York City]] in the 1970s.  For many decades the company focused its creations on Hans' beloved colored gems, although Stern also won several Diamonds International Awards and other prizes for ''avant garde'' diamond designs.  

Always a visionary, Stern led the business to another phase of international expansion by entering in the [[Basel Jewelry and Watch Fair]] in [[Basel, Switzerland]], in 2003 for the first time.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; From the jewelry and watch fair, he was able to establish a growing network of contacts and partnerships throughout [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and the [[Middle East]] adding another 150 points of sale to the network, through retail partnerships with department stores and specialty retailers.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;
[[File:The Crystals Las Vegas 4.JPG|thumb|H. Stern boutique in [[The Crystals (Las Vegas)]]]]
As of late 2007, there are now 160 stores which are family owned and operated in 13 countries, and 150 shop in shops in another 19 countries&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; Hans' jewelry and gemstones have been featured in a number of international fashion magazines, such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Marie Claire]]'' and ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; His gems are often worn by celebrities. The H. Stern jewelry line is also now sold in upscale stores in cities as far away from Brazil as [[Frankfurt]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Moscow]], Mexico City, and [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

Stern's favorite gemstone was the [[tourmaline]], a [[Gemstone|stone]] which is commonly found throughout [[Minas Gerais]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Death==
Hans Stern died on October 26, 2007, in [[Rio de Janeiro]] at age 85.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8802/1/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5064">The modern '''Australian native food industry''', also called the '''[[bushfood]] industry''', had its initial beginnings in the 1970s and early 1980s, when regional enthusiasts and researchers started to target local native species. In the mid 1970s Brian Powell recognized the commercial potential of [[Santalum acuminatum|quangdong]] fruit and began its cultivation in orchards. Following this, the [[CSIRO]] became involved in quangdong research.

In the late 1970s, [[Peter Hardwick]] began investigating subtropical native plants suitable for commercial cropping, selecting fruit species like [[riberry]], [[Davidsonia]], and later leaf-spices, like [[lemon myrtle]], [[Aniseed myrtle]], and [[Dorrigo Pepper]]. Hardwick started targeting strong flavoured species suitable for processing, which later became the main industry strategy. In the 1980s, Hardwick worked in the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, where he met essential oils researcher, Dr Ian Southwell. Southwell played a significant role in providing the [[essential oil]] profiles of many of the most popular native spices.

In 1983. the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, headed by [[Jennie Brand-Miller]], undertook a nutritional analysis programme analyzing bushfood for Aboriginal health. [[Vic Cherikoff]], a member of the Human Nutrition Unit team, started-up a wholesale distribution company marketing native Australian ingredients. Cherikoff played a vital role in linking-up the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and regional bushfood research with the restaurant and food processing industry. Cherikoff also contributed to Jennifer Isaacs' book, ''Bush Food'' and authored ''The Bushfood Handbook'' and ''Uniquely Australian, A wildfood cookbook'' which publicly defined the emerging industry.

In the mid-1980s several Australian theme restaurants opened-up in [[Sydney]]. This included ''Rowntrees The Australian Restaurant'', run by Chef [[Jean-Paul Bruneteau]] and Jenny Dowling. In 1996, Bruneteau, Dowling and Cherikoff opened a second restaurant, ''Riberries – Taste Australia''. ''Edna’s Table'' restaurant also opened-up and was run by brother and sister team, Chef Raymond Kersh and Jennice Kersh. The ''Red Ochre Grill'' in [[Adelaide]] opened-up in the early 1990s, with Andrew Fielke as its chef. Fielke also co-founded a production company, ''Australian Native Produce Industries'' (ANPI).

Value-added production emerged in the late 1980s with products marketed via mainstream retailers. Ian and Juleigh Robbins, established a line of processed sauces, jams and dried spice products through ''Robin's Foods Pty Ltd''. Boutique value-added production − such as jams, sauces and beverages – has become increasingly significant in the regional development of native foods.

Small-scale trial commercial production of native food plants started to occur in the late 1980s, especially in Northern New South Wales. In 1994 the [[Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation]] and [[Greening Australia]] co-sponsored a conference on growing bushfoods near Lismore. The [[2000 Olympic Games]], in Sydney, were targeted by the developing industry as an event for promoting native foods.

Various regionally based industry associations were formed to represent growers in a national process. Government agencies have become increasingly involved with new native crop development. [[CSIRO]] researcher, Dr Stephen Sykes,  developed a range of native ''Citrus'' hybrids which became available through ANPI.

Since 2000 the industry has continued to consolidate, with a growing overseas market for produce and greater refinement in production methods to supply the demand. Some new products have been introduced, including [[Finger Lime]], mintbush and ''[[Eucalyptus olida]]''. However, while the rate of introduction of new native food-plant species has slowed since the early period of the industries conception in the 1980s, the marketing of herb and spice blends, fruit mixtures and functional extracts has grown, potentially leading the industry into new and larger market segments.

Crops initially associated mainly with bushfood, such as [[lemon myrtle]], have since broadened to become associated with [[essential oils]] and [[cosmetics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7818">'''Indian Ethos in Management''' refers to the [[Value (ethics)|values]] and practices that the [[culture of India]] (''Bharatheeya Sanskriti'') can contribute to service, [[leadership]] and [[management]]. These values and practices are rooted in ''[[Sanathana Dharma]]'' (the eternal essence), and have been influenced by various strands of [[Indian philosophy]].

==Work values from Bharatheeya Sanskriti==
1. ''Paropakaaraartham Idam Shareeram'' - The body is meant for serving others or for the higher [[common good]].

2. ''Atmanomokshartham Jagat Hitayacha'' - Endeavors should be made considering the [[well-being]] of the world too, while considering the (spiritual) well-being of oneself.

3. ''[[Trikaranasuddhi]]'' - To consider work as a means to grow oneself in 'Purity and Unity of Thought, Word and Deed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sankar R N|first1=Ajith|title=Ascertaining Linkages between Trikarana Suddhi and 'Tapping Spirituality as the Context of Leadership'|journal=IPE Journal of Management|date=July–December 2012|volume=2|issue=2|page=81|url=http://www.ipeindia.org/data/IPEJM/IPEJM_2_2_6.pdf|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. ''Yagnaya charatha: karma'' - To engage in work as a sacred offering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karma as yagna|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/religion/karma-as-yagna/article8292954.ece|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yagna Bhava – Selfless Karma with an Attitude of Sacrifice|url=http://indianethos.com/yagna-bhava-selfless-karma-with-an-attitude-of-sacrifice/|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Attempts have been made to distill aspects related to management theory and practice from various texts of India. A variety of works has influenced this area and few of them include ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]], [[Thirukkural]], [[Mahabharatha]], [[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''

'''Logi Analytics, Inc.''' is a [[computer software]] company headquartered in [[McLean, Virginia|McLean]], [[Virginia]], United States with offices in the UK and Sweden.  It offers interactive [[data visualization]] products for [[business intelligence]] and [[business analytics]].

==History==
Logi Analytics, formerly ''LogiXML'', was founded in 2000 by Arman Eshraghi, a software development and architecture professional. The company claims its mission is "to provide the benefits of traditional business intelligence to small- and mid-sized organizations".

In 2000, Logi Analytics developed LGX AppDev, an [[XML]]-based engine that built Web applications and evolved to address the specific task of report-building for BI. AppDev was used as the basis for the company's first product introduction in 2002. Logi Report (then called LGX Report), the first engine-driven, XML-based reporting application. Between 2002 and 2004, more features were added to Logi Report until Eshraghi made the decision to brand the full-featured version separately - as Logi Info - and offer the basic version free of charge.
 
Then in 2004, Logi Analytics began [[marketing]] Logi Report as a free Web-based BI reporting tool. The product was renamed Logi Report or ''Freereporting.com''.&lt;ref&gt;DM Review, July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Logi Analytics discontinued the LGX branding and introduced the Logi product line, consisting of applications for ''ad hoc'', managed and [[OLAP]] reporting, an embedded [[database]] to be used between operational databases and reporting servers, and a connector pack for integration of commonly used Web-based sources into the Logi reporting environment.  They also started to expand internationally, partnering firstly with Nano Blue in AsiaPac, then Intenda in EMEA.

In 2008, Logi Analytics streamlined its commercial product offering, concentrating on Logi Info (managed reporting, analysis and dashboarding), Logi Ad Hoc (ad hoc reporting, analysis and dashboarding), and the Logi 9 platform (Web-based BI platform including managed and ad hoc reporting, analysis, dashboarding and data integration).

The company changed its name to '''Logi Analytics'' in March, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Logi Analytics: Former LogiXML is the New Old Kid on the BI Block | date=19 Mar 2013 | url=http://www.information-management.com/news/Logi-Analytics-Former-LogiXML-is-the-New-Old-Kid-on-the-BI-Block-10024091-1.html | publisher=Information Management | last=Kern | first=Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Logi Analytics received a $27.5 million growth equity investment led by new investor LLR Partners. Updata Partners also participated in the round. The company previously raised $23.1 million from Updata Partners, Grotech Ventures and Summit Partners, who remain invested in the company.

In 2014, Logi Analytics introduced its data discovery product, Logi Vision, to be deployed as a stand-alone application or integrated with its business information platform, Logi Info. Together, these integrated products can be used by customers to address a wide range of analytics use cases across the organisation.

In July 2015, Logi DataHub was introduced as part of the Logi 12 release, designed to simplify data preparation and ensure high performance for self-service analytics. With DataHub, customers can rapidly connect, acquire, and blend data from files, applications or databases, whether on-premise or in the cloud; cache it in a high-performance self-tuning repository; and prepare it using DataHub's smart profiling, joining, and intuitive data enrichment.

In October 2017, Logi Analytics was acquired by Marlin Equity Partners, a global investment firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marlinequity.com/marlin-completes-acquisition-logi-analytics/|title=Marlin completes the acquisition of Logi Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Tositsas''' is one of the Great Benefactors of Greece. He was born in [[Metsovo]] in 1787, and in 1806 he took over his father’s fur shop in [[Thessaloniki]], together with his brothers. After developing his business significantly, he sent his brothers to Egypt to open a branch there while he opened branches in [[Livorno]] and [[Malta]].

In 1820 he moved to Malta himself. His acquaintance with Egypt’s [[Mohammed Ali Tewfik|Prince Regent Mohammed Ali]] resulted in the Prince taking high esteem in him and appointing him his personal advisor as well as at the helm of the first state bank, the head of the Nile Riverboat company and administrator of his land.

Tositsas, who became one of Egypt’s most powerful landowners, also served as Greece’s first General Consul in [[Alexandria]] and is generally regarded as the father of [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenism]] of Egypt. He contributed to the establishment of the Greek Community and, together with his brothers, he helped the community develop significant educational and religious infrastructure. In 1854 he moved to Athens where he died in 1856. His charitable work was not limited to Alexandria but was equally important in Athens, Thessaloniki and his birthplace Metsovo. In his will he left vast amounts for aid for the poor and the support of hospitals, churches and schools. Among them the most notable ones are his contributions to the [[University of Athens]], the Arsakio School and the [[National Technical University of Athens]]. After his death, his wife Eleni continued his charity work by donating large amounts to educational and charity organizations as well as for the construction and completion of the National Technical University of Athens. His younger brother, Theodore, who also became very wealthy in Egypt, returned to Greece after the liberation from the Ottomans and donated the largest part of his wealth to foundations.

'''Naftali Blumenthal''' ({{lang-he|נפתלי בלומנטל}}, born 1 March 1922) is an [[Israel]]i former politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] from 1981 until 1984.

==Biography==
Born in Stanisławów in [[Poland]] (now [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] in [[Ukraine]]), Blumenthal made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1934. He was a member of the [[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, and joined the [[Haganah]] at the age of 16. During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], he served as a company commander in the [[Carmeli Brigade]], and was later demobilised with the rank of captain.

He worked as an accountant, and joined [[Solel Boneh]] in 1951. In 1958 he became comptroller of the Industrial Section at [[Koor Industries]], in 1965 became head of the Finances Section, and from 1977 until 1982 served as its general director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=293 Naftali Blumenthal: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

Having joined [[Mapai]] in 1950, Blumenthal became the party's treasurer. After it merged into the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] in 1968, he became a member of its central committee, bureau and socio-economic committee. In [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] he was elected to the Knesset on the Alignment list (an alliance of the Labor Party and [[Mapam]]). He sat on the Finance Committee until losing his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 elections]].

In 1986 he became comptroller of the [[Histadrut]].

It originated in 1921 after the death of Oswald Watt and is awarded for "A most brilliant performance in the air or the most notable contribution to aviation by an Australian or in Australia" by the [[Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia]]. As it is awarded on merit it is not an annual award; between the award's creation and 1999 it had been awarded a total of 48 times.

A '''partnership''' is an arrangement where parties, known as [[business partners|partners]], agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, [[business entity|businesses]], [[interest]]-based [[organization]]s, [[school]]s, [[government]]s or combinations. [[Organization]]s may partner to increase the likelihood of each achieving their mission and to amplify their reach. A partnership may result in issuing and holding equity or may be only governed by a contract.

==History==

Partnerships have a long history; they were already in use in Medieval times in Europe and in the Middle East. 
In Europe, the partnerships contributed to the [[Commercial Revolution]] which started in the 13th century. In the 15th century the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]], would mutually strengthen each other; a ship from Hamburg to Danzig would not only carry its own cargo but was also commissioned to transport freight for other members of the league. This practice not only saved time and money, but also constituted a first step toward partnership. This capacity to join forces in reciprocal services became a distinctive feature, and a long lasting success factor, of the Hanseatic team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beerbühl|first1=Margrit Schulte|title=Networks of the Hanseatic League|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/european-networks/economic-networks/margrit-schulte-beerbuehl-networks-of-the-hanseatic-league|website=EGO European History Online|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A close examination of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called ''commenda'', very popular with Italian merchant bankers.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Favier, Gold &amp; Spices: the rise of commerce in the middle ages, Holmes &amp; Meier Pub; 1st US edition, July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Florentine [[merchant banks]] were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.

In the Middle East, the ''[[Qirad]]'' and ''Mudarabas'' institutions developed when trade with the Levant, namely the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim Near East, flourished and when early [[Trading company|trading companies]], [[contract]]s, [[bills of exchange]] and long-distance [[international trade]] were established.&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;Jairus Banaji (2007), "Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism", ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]'' '''15''' (1): 47–74, [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Levant trade revived in the tenth to eleventh centuries in Byzantine Italy. The eastern and western Mediterranean formed part of a single commercial civilization in the Middle Ages, and the two regions were economically interdependent through trade (in varying degrees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laiou|first1=Angeliki E.|title=The Economic History of Byzantium: From the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century|date=2008|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|isbn=088402332X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Igp8hxsHV_AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership agreements==
Although not required by law, partners may benefit from a partnership agreement that defines the important terms of the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Partnership|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/partnership.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnership agreements can be formed in the following areas: 
* Business: two or more companies join forces in a joint venture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bamford|first1=James|last2=Ernst|first2=David|last3=Fubini|first3=David G.|title=Launching a World-Class Joint Venture|url=https://hbr.org/2004/02/launching-a-world-class-joint-venture|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a consortium to i) work on a project (e.g. industrial or research project) which would be too heavy or too risky for a single entity, ii) join forces to have a stronger position on the market, iii) comply with specific regulation (e.g. in some emerging countries, foreigners can only invest in the form of partnerships with local entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coispeau|first1=Olivier|title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and Partnerships in China|date=18 May 2015|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co|isbn=9814641022|page=311|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814641036_fmatter|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the alliance may be structured in a process comparable to a [[Mergers &amp; Acquisitions]] transaction.
* Politics (or geopolitics): In what is usually called an [[Political alliance|alliance]], governments may partner to achieve their national interests, sometimes against allied governments holding contrary interests, as occurred during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. 
* Knowledge: In [[education]], [[Educational accreditation|accrediting agencies]] increasingly evaluate schools, or universities, by the level and quality of their partnerships with local or international peers and a variety of other entities across societal sectors. 
* Individual: Some partnerships occur at [[domestic partnership|personal levels]], such as when two or more individuals agree to domicile together, while other partnerships are not only personal, but private, known only to the involved parties.

Partnerships present the involved parties with complex negotiation and special challenges that must be navigated unto agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of responsibility, lines of authority and [[Succession planning|succession]], how success is evaluated and distributed, and often a variety of other factors must all be negotiated. Once agreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], especially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement affirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up [[Articles of Partnership]]. Trust and pragmatism are also essential as it cannot be expected that everything can be written in the initial partnership agreement, therefore quality governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zadek|first1=Simon|last2=Radovich|first2=Sacha|title=Governing collaborative governance|journal=John F. Kennedy School of Government|date=April 2006|url=https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/workingpaper_23_zadek_radovich.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clear communication are critical success factors in the long run. It is common for information about formally partnered entities to be made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public records laws.

While industrial partnerships stand to amplify mutual interests and accelerate success, some forms of collaboration may be considered ethically problematic. When a politician, for example, partners with a corporation to advance the latter's interest in exchange for some benefit, a [[conflict of interest]] results; consequentially, the [[public good]] may suffer. While technically lawful in some jurisdictions, such practice is broadly viewed negatively or as [[corruption]].

==Partner compensation==
Partner compensation will often be defined by the terms of a partnership agreement. Partners who work for the partnership may receive compensation for their labor before any division of profits between partners.

===Equity vs. salaried partners===
In certain partnerships of individuals, particularly [[law firm]]s and [[accountancy]] firms, '''equity partners''' are distinguished from '''salaried partners''' (or '''contract or income partners'''). The degree of control which each type of partner exerts over the partnership depends on the relevant [[partnership agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serrill-Robins|first1=Mira|title=Equity vs. Non-Equity Partnerships|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/lexis-hub/b/careerguidance/archive/2010/03/15/equity-vs-non-equity-partner-what-the-difference-means-to-you.aspx|website=LexisNexis Legal Newsroom|publisher=Relx Group|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An equity partner is a part-owner of the [[business]], and is entitled to a proportion of the distributable [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] of the partnership.
* A salaried partner who is paid a [[salary]] but does not have any underlying ownership interest in the business and will not share in the [[dividend|distributions]] of the partnership (although it is quite common for salaried partners to receive a bonus based on the firm's profitability).

Although individuals in both categories are described as partners, equity partners and salaried partners have little in common other than [[joint and several liability]]. In many legal systems, salaried partners are not technically "partners" at all in the eyes of the law. However, if their firm holds them out as partners, they are nonetheless subject to joint and several liability.

In their most basic form, equity partners enjoy a fixed share of the partnership (usually, but not always an equal share with the other partners) and, upon distribution of profits, receive a portion of the partnership's profits proportionate to that share. In more sophisticated partnerships, different models exist for determining either ownership interest, profit distribution, or both. Two common alternate approaches to distribution of profit are "[[lockstep compensation|lockstep]]" and "[[Merit pay|source of origination]]" [[remuneration|compensation]] (sometimes referred to, more graphically, as "eat what you kill").&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Norman|title=Better carrots for partner compensation strategies|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b1849e63-a519-4da7-979c-0753525fef6b|website=Lexology|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lockstep involves new partners joining the partnership with a certain number of "points". As time passes, they accrue additional points, until they reach a set maximum sometimes referred to as a plateau. The length of time it takes to reach the maximum is often used to describe the firm (so, for example, one could say that one firm has a "seven-year lockstep" and another has a "ten-year lockstep" depending on the length of time it takes to reach maximum equity).
*Source of origination involves the compensation of profits according to a formula that takes into consideration the amount of revenue and profit generated by each partner, such that partners who generate more revenue receive a greater share of the partnership's distributed profit.

===Law firms===
Source of origination compensation is rarely seen outside of law firms. The principle is simply that each partner receives a share of the partnership profits up to a certain amount, with any additional profits being distributed to the partner who was responsible for the "origination" of the work that generated the profits.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;

British law firms tend to use the lockstep principle, whereas American firms are more accustomed to source of origination. When British firm [[Clifford Chance]] merged with American firm [[Rogers &amp; Wells]], many of the difficulties associated with that [[merger]] were blamed on the difficulties of merging a lockstep culture with a source of origination culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Becker|first1=Amanda|title=Law firm merger activity picks up|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/02/AR2010070204907.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
Partnerships recognized by a government body may enjoy special benefits from [[Tax policy|taxation policy]]. Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are often favored over [[corporation]]s in taxation policy, since [[dividend tax]]es only occur on profit before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending on the partnership structure and the [[jurisdiction]] in which it operates, owners of a partnership may be exposed to greater [[personal liability]] than they would as [[shareholder]]s of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often regulated via [[anti-trust]] laws, so as to inhibit [[monopoly|monopolistic practices]] and foster [[Market economy|free market competition]]. Enforcement of the laws, however, varies considerably. Domestic partnerships recognized by governments typically enjoy tax benefits, as well.

==Common law==
At [[common law]], members of a business partnership are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. Forms of partnership have evolved that may limit a partner's liability.

===Forms of partnership===
As [[common law]] there are two basic forms of partnership:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Op-Qu/Partnership.html|website=Reference for Business|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[general partnership]]: a partnership in which all partners manage the business and are personally liable for its debts. General partners have an obligation of [[strict liability]] to third parties injured by the Partnership. General partners may have [[joint liability]] or [[joint and several liability]] depending upon circumstances.
#[[limited partnership]] (LP): a partnership in which general partners manage the partnership's operations, and limited partners forego the right to manage the business in exchange for [[limited liability]] for the partnership debts. The liability of limited partners is limited to their investment in the partnership.

More recently, additional forms of partnership have been recognized:
*[[limited liability partnership]] (LLP): a form of partnership in which all partners may have some degree of limited liability.
* [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP): a form of limited partnership in which general partners have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership.

===Silent partners===
A '''''silent partner''''' is one who still shares in the profits and losses of the business, but who is not involved in its management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent partner|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/silent_partner|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the silent partner's interest in the business will not be publicly known. A silent partner is often an investor in the partnership, who is entitled to a share of the partnership's profits. Silent partners may prefer to invest in limited partnerships in order to insulate their personal assets from the debts or liabilities of the partnership.

===Australia===
{{Main|Partnership (Australia)}}
Summarising s. 5 of the ''[[Partnership Act 1958]]'' (Vic) (hereinafter the "Act"), for a partnership in Australia to exist, four main criteria must be satisfied. They are:
* Valid Agreement between the parties;
* To carry on a business – this is defined in s. 3 as "any trade, occupation or profession";
* In Common – meaning there must be some mutuality of rights, interests and obligations;
* View to Profit – thus charitable organizations cannot be partnerships (charities are typically incorporated associations under ''Associations Incorporations Act 1981'' (Vic))
Partners share profits and losses. A partnership is basically a settlement between two or more groups or firms in which profit and loss are equally divided

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the relevant law for regulating partnership is the Partnership Act 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partnership Act, 1932|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=157|website=Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division|publisher=Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership is defined as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Section 4 of the Partnership Act 1932|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law does not require written partnership agreement between the partners to form a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goni|first1=Osman|title=Should you register your partnership?|url=https://osmangoni.com/register-partnership/|website=Osman Goni|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership does not also required to be registered, however an unregistered partnership has a number of limitation regarding enforcing its rights in any court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should you register your partnership?|url=https://osmangoni.com/register-partnership/|website=Osman Goni|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership is considered as a separate legal identity (i.e. separate from its owners) in Bangladesh only if the partnership is registered. There must be a minimum of 2 partners and maximum of 20 partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to start a partnership business in Bangladesh - OGR Legal|url=https://resource.ogrlegal.com/partnership-in-bangladesh/|website=Resource Portal of OGR Legal|publisher=OGR Legal|accessdate=29 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Statutory regulation of partnerships in Canada fall under [[Constitution Act, 1867|provincial jurisdiction]]. A partnership is not a separate legal entity and partnership income is taxed at the rate of the partner receiving the income. It can be deemed to exist regardless of the intention of the partners. Common elements considered by courts in determining the existence of a partnership are that two or more legal persons:
*Are carrying on a business
*In common
*With a view to profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: Partnerships – Am I in One and Why Does it Matter?|url=http://www.uvicblc.ca/2012/03/part-1-partnerships-am-i-in-one-and-why-does-it-matter/|website=Business Law Clinic|publisher=University of Victoria, Faculty of Law|accessdate=22 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224161517/http://www.uvicblc.ca/2012/03/part-1-partnerships-am-i-in-one-and-why-does-it-matter/|archivedate=24 February 2015|date=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Partnership (Hong Kong)}}
A partnership in Hong Kong is a business entity formed by the Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/38/ |title=Hong Kong Ordinances, CAP 38 Partnership Ordinance |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines a partnership as "the relation between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit" and is not a joint stock company or an incorporated company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/38/s3.html |title=Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance, Chapter 38, section 3 |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the business entity registers with the Registrar of Companies it takes the form of a limited partnership defined in the Limited Partnerships Ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/37/ |title=CAP 37 Limited Partnerships Ordinance |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hklii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/37/s4.html |title=Hong Kong Limited Partnerships Ordinance, Chapter 37, section 4 |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if this business entity fails to register with the Registrar of Companies, then it becomes a general partnership as a default.&lt;ref name="hklii.org"/&gt;

===India===
According to section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932,"Partnership is defined as the relation between two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business run by all or any one of them acting for all". This definition superseded the previous definition given in section 239 of Indian Contract Act 1872 as – “Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons who have agreed to combine their property, labor, skill in some business, and to share the profits thereof between them”. The 1932 definition added the concept of mutual agency. The Indian Partnerships have the following common characteristics:

1) '''A partnership firm is not a legal entity''' apart from the partners constituting it. It has limited identity for the purpose of tax law as per section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partnership Act, 1932|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/Partnership_Act_1932.pdf|website=Ministry of Corporate Affairs|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) '''Partnership is a concurrent subject'''. Contracts of partnerships are included in the Entry no.7 of List III of The Constitution of India (the list constitutes the subjects on which both the State government and Central (National) Government can legislate i.e. pass laws on).&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

3) '''Unlimited Liability'''. The major disadvantage of partnership is the unlimited liability of partners for the debts and liabilities of the firm. Any partner can bind the firm and the firm is liable for all liabilities incurred by any firm on behalf of the firm. If property of partnership firm is insufficient to meet liabilities, personal property of any partner can be attached to pay the debts of the firm.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

4) '''Partners are Mutual Agents'''.The business of firm can be carried on by all or any of them for all. Any partner has authority to bind the firm. Act of any one partner is binding on all the partners. Thus, each partner is ‘agent’ of all the remaining partners. Hence, partners are ‘mutual agents’. Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932 says "Subject to the provisions of this Act, a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm"&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

5) '''Oral or Written Agreements'''. The Partnership Act, 1932 nowhere mentions that the Partnership Agreement is to be in written or oral format. Thus the general rule of the [[Indian Contract Act 1872|Contract Act]] applies that the contract can be 'oral' or 'written' as long as it satisfies the basic conditions of being a contract i.e. the agreement between partners is legally enforceable. A written agreement is advisable to establish existence of partnership and to prove rights and liabilities of each partner, as it is difficult to prove an oral agreement.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

6) '''Number of Partners is minimum 2 and maximum 50 in any kind of business activities'''.Since partnership is ‘agreement’ there must be minimum two partners. The Partnership Act does not put any restrictions on maximum number of partners. However, section 464 of Companies Act 2013, and Rule 10 of Companies (Miscellaneous) Rules, 2014 prohibits partnership consisting of more than 50 for any businesses, unless it is '''registered as a company''' under [[Companies Act 2013|Companies Act, 2013]] or formed in pursuance of some other law. Some other law means companies and corporations formed via some other law passed by [[Parliament of India]].

7) '''Mutual agency is the real test'''. The real test of ‘partnership firm’ is ‘mutual agency’ set by the Courts of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

8) '''Global Safety Summit'''. The real test of ‘partnership firm’ is ‘mutual agency’ set by the public limited companies of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.

===United Kingdom limited partnership===
{{Main|UK partnership law}}

A limited partnership in the United Kingdom consists of:

* One or more people called general partners, who are liable for all debts and obligations of the firm; and
* One or of the firm beyond the amount contributed.

Limited partners may not:

* Draw out or receive back any part of their contributions to the partnership during its lifetime; or
* Take part in the management of the business or have power to bind the firm.

If they do, they become liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm up to the amount drawn out or received back or incurred while taking part in the management, as the case may be.

===United States===

Under U.S. law a partnership is a business association of two or more individuals, through which partners share the profits and responsibility for the liabilities of their venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/partnership|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. states recognize forms of limited partnership that may allow a partner who does not participate in the business venture to avoid liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Partnership|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/partnership.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships typically pay less taxes than corporations in fields like fund management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/84075784-11a2-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb|title=Private equity chiefs face conversion dilemma|last=Espinoza|first=Javier|last2=Indap|first2=Sujeet|date=2018-02-19|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/ares-switches-to-corporation-from-partnership-after-tax-overhaul|title=Ares Becomes Litmus Test for Buyout Firms Mulling Tax Change|date=2018-02-15|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government of the United States does not have specific statutory law governing the establishment of partnerships. Instead, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has its own statutes and common law that govern partnerships. The [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] has issued non-binding model laws (called uniform act) in which to encourage the adoption of uniformity of partnership law into the states by their respective legislatures. Model laws include the [[Uniform Partnership Act]] and the [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]]. Most U.S. states have adopted a form of the [[Uniform Partnership Act]], which includes provisions reguating  [[general partnership]]s, [[limited partnership]]s and [[limited liability partnership]]s.

Although the federal government does not have specific statutory law for establishing partnerships, it has an extensive statutory and regulatory scheme for the [[Partnership taxation (USA)|taxation of partnerships]], set forth in the [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRC) and [[Code of Federal Regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnerships|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/partnerships|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRC defines federal tax obligations for partnership operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 U.S. Code, Subtite A, Chapter 1, Subchapter K - Partners and Partnerships|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-K|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that effectively serve as federal regulation of some aspects of partnerships.

'''Porter's Five Forces Framework''' is a tool for analyzing competition of a business. It draws from [[Industrial organization|industrial organization (IO) economics]] to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (or lack of it) of an industry in terms of its profitability. An "unattractive" industry is one in which the effect of these five forces reduces overall profitability. The most unattractive industry would be one approaching "pure competition", in which available profits for all firms are driven to [[Profit (economics)#Normal profit|normal profit levels]]. The five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, [[Michael E. Porter]] of [[Harvard University]]. This framework was first published in ''Harvard Business Review'' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter, "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy," May 1979 (Vol. 57, No. 2), pp. 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter refers to these forces as the [[Market_environment#Micro-environment|microenvironment]], to contrast it with the more general term [[environmental scanning|macroenvironment]]. They consist of those forces close to a [[company]] that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the [[marketplace]] given the overall change in [[industry information]]. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every [[firm]] in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their [[core competencies]], [[business model]] or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline [[industry]]. As an industry, profitability is low because the industry's underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. A few carriers--[[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic]] is one--have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability.

Porter's five forces include three forces from 'horizontal' competition--the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants--and two others from 'vertical' competition--the [[bargaining power]] of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.

Porter developed his five forces framework in reaction to the then-popular [[SWOT analysis]], which he found both lacking in rigor and ''ad hoc''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Porter, Nicholas Argyres and Anita M. McGahan, "An Interview with Michael Porter", ''The Academy of Management Executive'' '''16''':2:44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4165839 at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Porter's five-forces framework is based on the [[structure–conduct–performance paradigm]] in [[Industrial organization|industrial organizational economics]]. It has been applied to try to address a diverse range of problems, from helping businesses become more profitable to helping governments stabilize industries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt; Other Porter strategy tools include the [[value chain]] and [[Porter generic strategies|generic competitive strategies]].

== Five Forces ==
{{strategy}}

=== Threat of new entrants ===
Profitable industries that yield high returns will attract new firms. New entrants eventually will decrease profitability for other firms in the industry. Unless the entry of new firms can be made more difficult by [[incumbents]], abnormal profitability will fall towards zero ([[perfect competition]]), which is the minimum level of profitability required to keep an industry in business.

The following factors can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose:
* The existence of [[barriers to entry]] ([[patents]], [[rights]], etc.). The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It's worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult.
* Government policy
* Capital requirements
* Absolute cost
* Cost disadvantages independent of size
* [[Economies of scale]]
* [[Product differentiation]]
* [[Brand equity]]
* Switching costs
* Expected retaliation 
* Access to distribution channels
* [[Customer loyalty]] to established brands
* Industry profitability (the more profitable the industry, the more attractive it will be to new competitors)
* [[Network effect]]

=== Threat of substitutes ===
A substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might "shrink the pie" for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely "grow the pie" (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke's expense. 

Potential factors:
* Buyer propensity to substitute
* Relative price performance of substitute
* Buyer's [[switching costs]]
* Perceived level of [[product differentiation]]
* Number of substitute products available in the market
* Ease of substitution
* Availability of close substitute

=== Bargaining power of customers ===
The bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the [[firm]] under pressure, which also affects the customer's sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers' power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices. 

Potential factors:
* Buyer concentration to [[firm]] [[concentration ratio]]
* Degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution
* Bargaining leverage, particularly in industries with high [[fixed cost]]s
* Buyer switching costs
* Buyer information availability
* Availability of existing substitute products
* Buyer [[price sensitivity]]
* Differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products
* [[RFM (customer value)]] Analysis

=== Bargaining power of suppliers ===
The bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the [[firm]] can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources.

Potential factors are:
* Supplier switching costs relative to [[firm]] switching costs
* Degree of differentiation of inputs
* Impact of inputs on cost and differentiation
* Presence of substitute inputs
* Strength of distribution channel
* Supplier concentration to [[firm]] concentration ratio
* Employee solidarity (e.g. [[labor unions]])
* Supplier competition: the ability to forward vertically integrate and cut out the buyer.

===  Competitive rivalry ===
For most industries the intensity of competitive rivalry is the major determinant of the competitiveness of the industry. Having an understanding of industry rivals is vital to successfully market a product. Positioning pertains to how the public perceives a product and distinguishes it from competitors. A business must be aware of its competitors marketing strategy and pricing and also be reactive to any changes made. 

Potential factors:
* Sustainable [[competitive advantage]] through [[innovation]]
* Competition between online and offline companies
* Level of [[advertising]] expense
* Powerful competitive strategy
* Firm [[concentration ratio]]

== Usages ==
Strategy consultants occasionally use Porter's five forces [[Conceptual framework|framework]] when making a qualitative evaluation of a [[firm]]'s strategic position. However, for most consultants, the framework is only a starting point. They might use [[value chain]] or another type of analysis in conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/blog/introduction-to-strategy-development-and-strategy-execution/ | title=Introduction to Strategy Development and Strategy Execution | publisher=Flevy | date=21 October 2014 | accessdate=2 November 2014 | author=Tang, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like all general frameworks, an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered naive.

According to Porter, the five forces framework should be used at the line-of-business industry level; it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level. An industry is defined at a lower, more basic level: a market in which similar or closely related products and/or services are sold to buyers. (See [[industry information]].)  A [[firm]] that competes in a single industry should develop, at a minimum, one five forces analysis for its industry. Porter makes clear that for diversified companies, the primary issue in [[corporate strategy]] is the selection of [[Industry|industries]] ([[Industry|lines of business]]) in which the company will compete. The average ''Fortune Global 1,000'' company competes in 52 industries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-management/chapter/external-inputs-to-strategy/|title=External Inputs to Strategy {{!}} Boundless Management|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticisms ==
Porter's framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists. For instance, Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam claim that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces:
* That buyers, competitors, and suppliers are unrelated and do not interact and [[collusion|collude]].
* That the source of value is structural advantage (creating barriers to entry).
* That uncertainty is low, allowing participants in a market to plan for and respond to changes in competitive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam, "Bringing Discipline to Strategy, ''[[McKinsey Quarterly]]'', 1996, (Vol. 33, No. 4), pp. 14-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important extension to Porter's work came from Adam Brandenburger and [[Barry Nalebuff]] of [[Yale School of Management]] in the mid-1990s. Using [[game theory]], they added the concept of [[complementors]] (also called "the 6th force") to try to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances. Complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Brandenburger, A. M., &amp; Nalebuff, B. J. (1995). The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', (Vol. 73, No. 4), 57-71. [http://faculty.som.yale.edu/barrynalebuff/rightgame_hbr1995.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that [[complementors]] are the sixth force has often been credited to [[Andrew Grove]], former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]]. Martyn Richard Jones, while consulting at [[Groupe Bull]], developed an augmented five forces model in Scotland in 1993. It is based on Porter's Framework and includes Government (national and regional) as well as pressure groups as the notional 6th force. This model was the result of work carried out as part of [[Groupe Bull]]'s Knowledge Asset Management Organisation initiative.

Porter indirectly rebutted the assertions of other forces, by referring to innovation, government, and complementary products and services as "factors" that affect the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter. "The Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy", ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', January 2008 (Vol. 88, No. 1), pp. 78-93. [http://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy/ar/1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also perhaps not feasible to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry independently of the resources that a [[firm]] brings to that industry. It is thus argued (Wernerfelt 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wernerfelt, B. (1984), A Resource-based View of the Firm, ''[[Strategic Management Journal]]'', Vol. 5: pp. 171-180 [http://web.mit.edu/bwerner/www/papers/AResource-BasedViewoftheFirm.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; that this theory be combined with the [[Resource-based view|resource-based view (RBV)]] in order for the firm to develop a sounder framework.

== Doctrine of "no-work-no-pay" ==

The doctrine of "no-work-no-pay" is a fundamental axiom in [[industrial relations]]. The philosophy are very simple. When a person
is employed, it is expected that the work assigned will be carried out. When this work is not done, the employee is not
eligible for payment of any salary.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/op/2006/07/30/stories/2006073000031400.htm The Hindu : Open Page : No work, no pay] The Hindu dated July 30, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006041613/http://www.hindu.com/op/2006/07/30/stories/2006073000031400.htm |date=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when a [[general strike]] or countrywide ban disrupts [[public transport]] systems, and consequently employees are unable to reach their workplaces, the same principle prevails. Even die-hard [[trade union]] leaders respect this principle of equity and natural justice. "No work, no pay" lays a strong foundation to industrial peace and harmony in the long run.&lt;ref name="hindu.com"/&gt;

A '''stock market''', '''equity market''' or '''share market''' is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of [[stock]]s (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include ''securities'' listed on a public [[stock exchange]], as well as stock that is only traded privately. Examples of the latter include shares of private companies which are sold to [[investor]]s through [[equity crowdfunding]] platforms. Stock exchanges list shares of common equity as well as other security types, e.g. corporate bonds and convertible bonds.

==Size of the market==

Stocks are categorized in various ways. One way is by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, [[Nestlé]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland, so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although their stock may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.

As of mid 2017, the size of the world stock market (total [[market capitalization]]) was about US$76.3 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/stock-market/|title=Introduction to the Stock Market|author=Agarwal|first=|date=July 14, 2017|publisher=Intelligent Economist|access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By country, the largest market was the United States (about 34%), followed by [[Japan]] (about 6%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (about 6%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-exchanges.org/files/statistics/2012%20WFE%20Market%20Highlights.pdf WFE 2012 Market Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828194227/http://world-exchanges.org/files/statistics/2012%20WFE%20Market%20Highlights.pdf |date=August 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers increased in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2142523-global-stock-rally-world-market-cap-reached-record-high-in-march|title=Global Stock Rally: World Market Cap Reached Record High In March &amp;#124; Seeking Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, there are a total of 60 stock exchanges in the world with a total [[market capitalization]] of $69 trillion. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], these 16 exchanges are based in one of three continents: North America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-stock-exchanges-by-size/|title=All of the World's Stock Exchanges by Size|date=2016-02-16|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock exchange==
{{main|Stock exchange}}
A [[stock exchange]] is an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] (or [[Exchange (organized market)|bourse]]){{#tag:ref|The concept of the [[exchange (organized market)|bourse]] (or the [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]) was 'invented' in the medieval [[Low Countries]] (most notably in predominantly Dutch-speaking cities like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]) before the birth of formal stock exchanges in the 17th century. Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose – a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporations]] – or a stock exchange as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Larry (2005). "Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company", in Goetzmann &amp; Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165–175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} where [[stock broker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded "over the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss|title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &amp;#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ?|publisher=[[IBM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.

==Trade==
[[Image:Photos NewYork1 032.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]

Trade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.

Participants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].

Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange|commodity exchanges]], and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].

A potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.

The purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].

The [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the [[market maker|Designated Market Maker]] ("DMM") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid-offer spread|spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place – in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the "[[New York Stock Exchange|tape]]" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].

The [[NASDAQ]] is a virtual exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.

The [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system|order matching process]] was fully automated.

People trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortega |first1=Edgar |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=al86iws61SPY&amp;refer=home |last2= Yalman|first2=Onaran|title=UBS, Goldman Threaten NYSE, Nasdaq With Rival Stock Markets|publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=December 4, 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial regulators are probing [[dark pool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s-.html|title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | first=Sam|last=Mamudi|date=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0.html Financial regulators probe dark pools] Financial Times&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market participant==
[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|200px|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]

[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, insurance companies and hedge funds, and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.  Some studies have suggested that institutional investors and corporations trading in their own shares generally receive higher risk-adjusted returns than retail investors.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Amedeo De Cesari, Susanne Espenlaub, Arif Khurshed, and Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1884171 The Effects of Ownership and Stock Liquidity on the Timing of Repurchase Transactions] (October 2010). Paolo Baffi Centre Research Paper No. 2011-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few decades ago, most buyers and sellers were individual investors, such as wealthy businessmen, usually with long family histories to particular corporations. Over time, markets have become more "institutionalized"; buyers and sellers are largely institutions (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s).

The rise of the [[institutional investor]] has brought with it some improvements in market operations. There has been a gradual tendency for "fixed" (and exorbitant) fees being reduced for all investors, partly from falling administration costs but also assisted by large institutions challenging brokers' oligopolistic approach to setting standardized fees.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A current trend in stock market investments includes the decrease in fees due to computerized asset management termed [[Robo Advisers]] within the industry. Automation has decreased portfolio management costs by lowering the cost associated with investing as a whole.

=== Trends in market participation ===
Stock market participation refers to the number of agents who buy and sell equity backed securities either directly or indirectly in a financial exchange. Participants are generally subdivided into three distinct sectors; households, institutions, and foreign traders. Direct participation occurs when any of the above entities buys or sells securities on its own behalf on an exchange. Indirect participation occurs when an institutional investor exchanges a stock on behalf of an individual or household. Indirect investment occurs in the form of pooled investment accounts, retirement accounts, and other managed financial accounts.

==== Indirect vs. direct investment ====
The total value of equity-backed securities in the United States rose over 600% in the 25 years between 1989 and 2012 as market capitalization expanded from $2,790 billion to $18,668 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) {{!}} Data {{!}} Graph|url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/countries/1W-US?display=graph|website = data.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite report |date=September 1995 |title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1995 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1995/compendia/statab/115ed.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=513 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite report |date=August 2011 |title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/statab/131ed.html?cssp=SERP |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=730  |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Rydqvist, Spizman, and [[Ilya Strebulaev|Strebulaev]] attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets|url = https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1428442|date = 2013-01-01|first = Kristian|last = Rydqvist|first2 = Joshua|last2 = Spizman|first3 = Ilya A.|last3 = Strebulaev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====
Rates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite report |date=June 2012 |title=Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2007 to 2010: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/pdf/scf12.pdf |publisher=Federal Reserve Board of Governors |page=24 |accessdate=2015-12-17 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same time period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite report |date=September 2014 |title=Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf |publisher=Federal Reserve Board of Governors |page=20  |accessdate=2015-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Participation by head of household race and gender ====
The racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3% Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation ====
In a 2003 paper by Vissing-Jørgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Annette |last=Vissing-Jørgensen |title=Perspectives on Behavioral Finance: Does ‘Irrationality’ Disappear with Wealth?

Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual’s decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation|last = Hong|first = Harrison|date = February 2004|journal = The Journal of Finance|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00629.x|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.

==History==
[[File:Brugge - Saaihalle en beurs.jpg|thumb|200px|The term [[Exchange (organized market)|bourse]] is derived from the 13th-century inn named "Huis ter Beurze" (center) in [[Bruges]]. From predominantly Dutch-speaking cities of the [[Low Countries]] (like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerpt]]), the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'börse', etc.]]
===Early history===
In 12th-century France, the ''courretiers de change'' were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the "Brugse Beurse", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 |title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto |publisher=Belgiumview.com |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring countries and "Beurzen" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Rotterdam]].

In the middle of the 13th century, [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.

{{Cquote|The stock market — the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do — would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs. (...) And it has many other distinctive characteristics. Apart from the economic advantages and disadvantages of stock exchanges — the advantage that they provide a free flow of capital to finance industrial expansion, for instance, and the disadvantage that they provide an all too convenient way for the unlucky, the imprudent, and the gullible to lose their money — their development has created a whole pattern of social behavior, complete with customs, language, and predictable responses to given events. What is truly extraordinary is the speed with which this pattern emerged full blown following the establishment, in 1611, of the world's first important stock exchange — a roofless courtyard [[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|in Amsterdam]] — and the degree to which it persists (with variations, it is true) on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the nineteen-sixties. Present-day [[stock trading]] in the United States — a bewilderingly vast enterprise, involving millions of miles of private telegraph wires, computers that can read and copy the Manhattan Telephone Directory in three minutes, and over twenty million [[stockholder]] participants — would seem to be a far cry from a handful of seventeenth-century Dutchmen haggling in the rain. But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was, inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species' self-understanding. The behaviour of the pioneering Dutch [[stock trader]]s is ably documented in a book entitled “Confusion of Confusions,” written by a plunger on the Amsterdam market named [[Joseph de la Vega]]; originally published in 1688, (...)|200px||[[John Brooks (writer)|John Brooks]], in “Business Adventures” (1968)&lt;ref&gt;[[John Brooks (writer)|Brooks, John]] (1968). “The  Fluctuation: The Little Crash in '62”, in “Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street”.

{{Cquote|Even in the days before [[perestroika]], [[socialism]] was never a monolith. Within the [[Communist countries]], the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, quasi-[[syndicalist]] system of Yugoslavia to the centralized [[totalitarianism]] of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor [[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises]], the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as "socialist" or not. At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. "A stock market," he answered promptly. "A stock market is crucial to the existence of [[capitalism]] and [[private property]]. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles to the [[means of production]]. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist."

===Function and purpose===
The stock market is one of the most important ways for [[Company|companies]] to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocapitalmarkets.org/?q=node/176|title=Equity market Size relative to bond markets and bank assets|work=eurocapitalmarkets.org|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other [[immoveable]] assets. Some companies actively increase liquidity by trading in their own shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Amedeo De |last=Cesari |first2=Susanne |last2=Espenlaub |first3=Arif |last3=Khurshed |first4=Michael |last4=Simkovic |ssrn=1884171 |title=The Effects of Ownership and Stock Liquidity on the Timing of Repurchase Transactions |year=2010 |work=Paolo Baffi Centre Research Paper No. 2011-100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Simkovic |ssrn=1117303 |title=The Effect of Enhanced Disclosure on Open Market Stock Repurchases |journal=Berkeley Business Law Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

History has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.&lt;ref&gt;Mahipal Singh, 2011, {{ISBN|9788182055193}}, April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, [[central bank]]s tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of [[financial system]] functions. Financial stability is the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of central banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp0970.pdf|title = Financial Stability Frameworks and the Role of Central Banks: Lessons from the Crisis|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the [[counterparty]] could default on the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clearinghouse Definition &amp; Example {{!}} Investing Answers|url = http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/investing/clearinghouse-2830|website = www.investinganswers.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates [[economic growth]] in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Levine |title=Bank-Based or Market-Based Financial Systems: Which Is Better? |journal=Journal of Financial Intermediation |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=2002 |pages=398–428 |doi=10.1006/jfin.2002.0341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent events such as the [[Global Financial Crisis]] have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD354.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/future-of-computer-trading|title=Future of computer trading|work=www.gov.uk|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called [[market microstructure]]), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of [[systemic risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. |last=Alexander |first2=R. |last2=Dhumale |first3=J. |last3=Eatwell |title=Global Governance of Financial Systems: The International Regulation of Systemic Risk |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-516698-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to the modern financial system===
The financial system in most western countries has undergone a remarkable transformation. One feature of this development is [[disintermediation]]. A portion of the funds involved in saving and financing, flows directly to the financial markets instead of being routed via the traditional bank lending and deposit operations. The general public interest in investing in the stock market, either directly or through [[mutual fund]]s, has been an important component of this process.

Statistics show that in recent decades, shares have made up an increasingly large proportion of households' financial assets in many countries. In the 1970s, in [[Sweden]], [[deposit account]]s and other very liquid assets with little risk made up almost 60 percent of households' financial wealth, compared to less than 20 percent in the 2000s. The major part of this adjustment is that [[financial portfolio]]s have gone directly to shares but a good deal now takes the form of various kinds of institutional investment for groups of individuals, e.g., pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, insurance investment of premiums, etc.

The trend towards forms of saving with a higher risk has been accentuated by new rules for most funds and insurance, permitting a higher proportion of shares to bonds. Similar tendencies are to be found in other [[Developed country|developed countries]]. In all developed economic systems, such as the European Union, the United States, Japan and other developed nations, the trend has been the same: saving has moved away from traditional (government insured) "bank deposits to more risky securities of one sort or another".

A second transformation is the move to [[electronic trading]] to replace human trading of listed [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

'''Compared to Other Asset Classes''' Over the long term, investing in a well diversified portfolio of stocks such as an S&amp;P 500 Index outperforms other investment vehicles such as Treasury Bills and Bonds, with the S&amp;P 500 having a geometric  annual average of  9.55% from 1928 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html|title=Historical Returns|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior of the stock market===
[[Image:NASDAQ.JPG|upright|thumb|[[NASDAQ]] in Times Square, New York City]]
Investors may temporarily move financial prices away from market equilibrium. Over-reactions may occur—so that excessive optimism (euphoria) may drive prices unduly high or excessive pessimism may drive prices unduly low.  Economists continue to debate whether financial markets are generally efficient.

According to one interpretation of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (EMH), only changes in fundamental factors, such as the outlook for margins, profits or dividends, ought to affect share prices beyond the short term, where [[Randomness|random]] 'noise' in the system may prevail. The 'hard' [[efficient-market hypothesis]] does not explain the cause of events such as the [[Black Monday (1987)|crash in 1987]], when the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] plummeted 22.6 percent—the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cutler, D. Poterba, J. &amp; Summers, L. 1991 520–546"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cutler, D. Poterba, J. &amp; Summers, L. | title = Speculative dynamics | year = 1991 | journal = Review of Economic Studies | volume = 58 | pages = 520–546 | doi = 10.2307/2298010 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect ''any'' 'reasonable' development that might have accounted for the crash. (Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[Randomness|chance]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be the case more generally that many price movements (beyond that which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.&lt;ref name="Cutler, D. Poterba, J. &amp; Summers, L. 1991 520–546"/&gt;

A 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to ''systematically'' profit from any momentary market '[[Market anomaly|inefficiencies]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence, annot. ed. | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 0-465-04357-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, 2nd ed. | publisher = Random House | isbn = 1-4000-6793-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that [[Behavioral economics|psychological factors]] may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124–1131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon—also from psychology—that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.

In one paper the authors draw an analogy with [[gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Stephen Morris (game theorist) |first=Stephen |last=Morris |first2=Hyun Song |last2=Shin |title=Risk management with interdependent choice |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=52–62 |year=1999 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/15.3.52 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~smorris/Published/paper_21_Risk_Management.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal times the market behaves like a game of [[roulette]]; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.

In the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent of the analyst's recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000–2002 bear market, the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Stock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Many different academic researchers have stated companies with low P/E ratios and smaller sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market.  Research carried out states mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies and smaller companies have higher returns historically.

=== Irrational behavior ===
Sometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counterreaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].

Over the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.

Behaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes."]]

Data from different twenty-year periods is color-coded as shown in the key. See also [[:Image:Price-Earnings Ratios as a Predictor of Ten-Year Returns (Shiller Data).png|ten-year returns]]. Shiller states that [[:Image:Price-Earnings Ratios as a Predictor of Ten-Year Returns (Shiller Data).png|this plot]] "confirms that long-term investors—investors who commit their money to an investment for ten full years—did do well when prices were low relative to earnings at the beginning of the ten years. Long-term investors would be well advised, individually, to lower their exposure to the stock market when it is high, as it has been recently, and get into the market when it is low."&lt;ref name="IE2"/&gt;]]

A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in [[share price]]s of [[stock]]s listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.

There have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973–4]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.

One of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Another famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 – Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.

By the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history – the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names "Black Monday" and "Black Tuesday" are also used for October 28–29, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday—the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.

The crash in 1987 raised some puzzles – main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.

Since the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock market prediction===
{{Main|Stock market prediction}}
[[Tobias Preis]] and his colleagues [[Helen Susannah Moat]] and [[H. Eugene Stanley]] introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/counting-google-searches-predicts-market-movements-1.12879 | title=Counting Google searches predicts market movements | author=[[Philip Ball]] | work=Nature | date=April 26, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis of [[Google]] search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/google-search-terms-can-predict-stock-market-study-finds/ | title= Google Search Terms Can Predict Stock Market, Study Finds | author=Nick Bilton | work=[[New York Times]] | date=April 26, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22293693 | title=Google searches predict market moves | author=Jason Palmer | work=[[BBC]] | date=April 25, 2013 | accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock market index==
{{Main|Stock market index}}

The movements of the prices in a market or section of a market are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g., the [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.

==Derivative instruments==
{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}

Financial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges—their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.

==Leveraged strategies==
Stock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.

===Short selling===
{{Main|Short selling}}
In short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called "covering." This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.

===Margin buying===
{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}
In margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).

A margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)

Regulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).

==New issuance==
{{Main|Thomson Reuters league tables}}

Global issuance of equity and equity-related instruments totaled $505&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004, a 29.8% increase over the $389&amp;nbsp;billion raised in 2003. [[Initial public offering]]s (IPOs) by US issuers increased 221% with 233 offerings that raised $45&amp;nbsp;billion, and IPOs in [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|Europe, Middle East and Africa]] (EMEA) increased by 333%, from $9&amp;nbsp;billion to $39&amp;nbsp;billion.

==Investment strategies==
{{Main|Investment strategy}}
There are many different approaches to investing. Many strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, general economic conditions, etc.  [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management|risk control]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].

Additionally, many choose to invest via the [[index fund|index method]]. In this method, one holds a weighted or unweighted portfolio consisting of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&amp;P 500]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from too frequent trading, and ride the general trend of the stock market (which, in the U.S., has averaged nearly 10% per year, compounded annually, since [[World War II]]).

Responsible investment emphasizes and requires a long term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment; [[socially responsible investing]] is also recommended{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} in all types of investment.

==Taxation==
{{Main|Capital gains tax}}
According to much national or state legislation, a large array of fiscal obligations are taxed for [[capital gain]]s. Taxes are charged by the state over the transactions, dividends and capital gains on the stock market, in particular in the stock exchanges. These fiscal obligations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries{{which|date=November 2017}} avoid taxing profits on stocks as the profits are already taxed when companies file returns, but double taxation is common at some level in many countries.

'''''The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It''''' is the third book by [[John Jantsch]].&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Schawbel, Dan. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/10/11/is-the-work-you-do-worthwhile/ Is the work you do worthwhile?]. Forbes. October 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a follow up of Jantsch's previous book, ''The Referral Engine'', and teaches readers how to establish lasting commitment in their employees, customers, and businesses and explores what makes some businesses worth referring.&lt;ref name=comittmentengine&gt;{{cite book|last=Jantsch|first=John|title=The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It|year=2012|publisher=Portfolio|isbn=1591844878|pages=256|url=http://www.thecommitmentengine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Synopsis==
The book developed out of Jantsch's quest to understand why one successful [[entrepreneur]] can be fulfilled by their business while another successful entrepreneur cannot, which led him the commitment connection.&lt;ref name=v3im&gt;Kramer, Shelly. [http://www.v3im.com/2012/10/commitment-engine-how-to-make-work-worth-it/#axzz2ABF7nyuZ Commitment Engine: How to make it worth it]. v3 Integrated Marketing. October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Commitment Engine'' looks into what makes some businesses worth referring – and according to [[Jantsch]], it’s the commitment engine that drives the success of these businesses.&lt;ref name=Smallbiztrends&gt;Taylor, Ivana. [http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/10/the-commitment-engine-book-review.html The Commitment Engine Inspires Small Business Growth]. “Small Business Trends”. October 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also looks into what creates great [[company culture]].&lt;ref name=KCLibrary&gt;{{cite web|last=Jantsch|first=John|title=John Jantsch - The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It|url=http://www.kclibrary.org/event/john-jantsch-commitment-engine-making-work-worth-it|publisher=KC Library|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided up into three parts:

#The Path, which explores clarity of purpose, passion and the strategies used to bring purpose to life in your work.
#The Patron, which shows how to become a supportive leader who pulls all these characteristics together inside business.
#The Promise, where all of these elements come together to create a powerful brand where customers experience characteristics of commitment that contribute to customer loyalty and profitability.&lt;ref name=Smallbiztrends/&gt;

==Education==
Czechowicz holds the title of [[Master of Business Administration]] received from the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[Warsaw School of Economics]]. He also holds a master's degree in management, which he earned from the [[Wrocław University of Economics]] with prior bachelor's degree in industrial engineering.

==Business ventures==
First business activities, as a teenager, included coding, along with producing and selling computer accessories at the trade center in Wrocław,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ludzie.pb.pl/tomasz-czechowicz/2672290,33149,beastia-wychodzi-na-low|title=Tomasz Czechowicz – ludzie – whoiswho Pulsu Biznesu|website=ludzie.pb.pl|language=pl|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; later in Warsaw as well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://biznes.onet.pl/podatki/wiadomosci/najbogatsi-polacy-drapieznik-z-intuicja/8f1q5|title=Najbogatsi Polacy: drapieżnik z intuicją|date=2013-06-28|work=Onet Biznes|access-date=2017-11-27|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he moved to Wrocław to attend the university, he also began importing old and new computers to Poland, among them Commodore 64s, which made him one of the company's largest European customers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1990 Tomasz Czechowicz, Janusz Krasnopolski and Tomasz Gomułkiewicz co-founded [[JTT Computer]] SA. The company continued importing Commodores, but in 1997 a milestone was achieved by reaching an agreement with Intel and Microsoft to begin assembling their own PC's called ADAX.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://manager.money.pl/strategie/case_study/artykul/jtt;computer;-;bankructwo;przez;fiskusa;czy;na;zlecenie;konkurencji,48,0,142896.html|title=JTT Computer - bankructwo przez fiskusa, czy na zlecenie konkurencji?|last=Bonek|first=Tomasz|date=2006-03-02|work=WP money|access-date=2017-11-27|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czechowicz was the company's CEO until 1998. During these eight years he turned the company into a leading Central European PC assembly and distribution center,&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt; which generated the revenue of over $100 mln in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jtt.pl/pods/324_portfolio|title=RE-Invest - Portfolio|last=onepixeluniverse|website=www.jtt.pl|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview Tomasz Czechowicz said that experience with this company was very important to him and his future business ventures&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://manager.money.pl/ludzie/wywiady/artykul/tomasz;czechowicz;prezes;mci,90,0,136026.html|title=Tomasz Czechowicz,  prezes MCI|last=Gąsiorowski|first=Daniel|date=2006-02-06|work=WP money|access-date=2017-11-27|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview from 2016 he admitted that JTT Computer S.A. was one of the biggest business challenges and prepared him well for the following business plans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After leaving JTT Computer S.A., in 1999 Czechowicz founded MCI Group, one of the leading private equity groups in Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2013/07/17/polish-startups-must-look-beyond-home/|title=Polish Startups Must Look Beyond Home|last=Rooney|first=Ben|date=2013-07-17|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe, and has been its Managing Partner since then.

Within the MCI group, he is jointly responsible for preparing and implementing the long-term development strategy, preparing and execution of the business plan, as well as the group’s risk management. Tomasz Czechowicz is a member of various supervisory boards, being jointly responsible for providing opinions and decision-making on key strategic and operational matters in the portfolio companies, which have assets under management of PLN 2.3 Bn (Q3’2017).

It aims to build regional champions. Usual investment ticket ranges from EUR 10M – 25M in growth companies, and can reach up to EUR 100M in buyout companies.

MCI Capital is investing in over 40 companies, including [[ABC Data]], Answear.com, Azimo, eCard/Dotpay, Frisco.pl, Gett, Morele.net, NaviExperts and Prowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mci.pl/en/portfolio|title=MCI portfolio|last=|first=|date=|website=mci.pl|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange since February 2001 and on its first day it increased its worth by 50%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MCI is also a member of the Polish Private Equity Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psik.org.pl/funds.html|title=Polish Private Equity Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150429132116/http://www.psik.org.pl/funds.html|archive-date=2015-04-29|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Polish Association of Stock Exchange Issuers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://segnet.org.pl/spolki-seg?page=6|title=Polish Association of Stock Exchange Issuers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interesting facts==

=== Obtaining Invia ===
One of the companies in the MCI’s portfolio was Invia.cz, which today is the largest e-travel business in the Central and Eastern European region. Polish edition of Forbes describes a story of obtaining it by Czechowicz, which is related to his love of rock climbing. It took five tries for Czechowicz to reach the summit of Matterhorn,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but after his last and successful try by the end of the 2007, he went to Zurich to have a meeting with the representatives of Internet Travel Holding (which were back then the owners of Invia). Forbes implies that Czechowicz reaching the summit of “the symbolic mountain” made such an impression on the ITH’s representatives that they decided to sell him Invia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.pl/przywodztwo/tomasz-czechowicz-45-letni-podroznik-i-inwestor-z-doswiadczeniem-starca/460tc73|title=Inwestycyjna podróż Tomasza Czechowicza|date=2016-04-27|access-date=2017-11-27|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invia was sold in 2016 to investment fund Rockaway. This action allowed the MCI Group to have one of the best returns in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unquote.com/cee/official-record/97215/mci-makes-11x-on-eur76m-invia-exit-to-rockaway|title=MCI makes 11x on €76m Invia exit to Rockaway {{!}} Unquote|work=unquote.com|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investing against Uber ===
Tomasz Czechowicz, via MCI Capital, invested in Uber’s competition – GetTaxi (Gett), an application originating in Israel. It, similarly to Uber, allows to hail a taxi, but with appropriate licences and permissions, including the access to bus lanes in London. As Czechowicz remarks in the interview for Polish edition of Business Insider, ''“Uber created a brand, which taxi drivers perceive in the same way as unemployment. (…) This is kind of like discussing about the pharmacies.

'''Umestan''' is a [[business park]] in [[Umeå]], [[Sweden]].

==Description==
The business park took over these facilities in 1998, when [[Västerbottens regemente]]s' military operations were shut down. [[Umeå Municipality]] bought the entire area in order to create a business-and knowledge center. The buildings were renovated to meet the needs of modern business regarding comfort, environment and IT capabilities. The business park contains about 40 buildings, which have about 120 different tenants. Around 3&amp;nbsp;000 people visit the area every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise and development on historic ground|url=http://umestan.se/om-umestan/english-summary/|work=umestan.se|publisher=Umestan Företagspa|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historik|url=http://umestan.se/om-umestan/historik/|work=umestan.se|publisher=Umestan Företagspa|accessdate=3 May 2014|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Umeå stadsarkiv-1907-I20 under byggnad.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Västerbotten regiment barracks under construction in 1907.]]
In 2012 Umeå Municipality sold the park to Lersten for about 470 million kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nu är Umestan såld|url=http://www.folkbladet.nu/309825/nu-ar-umestan-sald|work=folkbladet.nu|publisher=Folkbladet|accessdate=3 May 2014|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wall Street Italia''''' (WSI) is a leading independent website in [[Italy]], specialized in business, financial, political news and analysis aimed to institutional and private investors. It is published by Wall Street Italia, Inc., a US company.

==Description==
''Wall Street Italia'' is not a broker, consequently, it can be considered "market neutral" for private and institutional investors who are active in the global market. Furthermore, ''WSI'' has never received public contributions or subsidies of any kind (contrary to a common practice in Italy).

In 2013 - a year of deep recession in Italy - unique visitors on the [[website]] grew +2,85% compared to 2012 to 4,291,359 vs 4,172,369: on average 357,614 unique visitors per month. In 2013 Page views were 79,954,835, on average 6,662,902 per month.  

==History==
Founded in New York in October 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wallstreetitalia.com/chisiamo.aspx?lng=eng |title= About Us |work= Wall Street Italia}}&lt;/ref&gt; by longtime financial journalist [[Luca Ciarrocca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-12-31/entertainment/9312280123_1_caffe-latte-milk-italians |title= Espresso Gets Yankee Twist Italians Bemused At The Way Their Simple Drink Is Altered}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/718964/1/olivetti-prepares-bid-for-larger-rival.html|title= Olivetti Prepares Bid for Larger Rival}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who holds a degrees in Law and a Master in Business Administration) Wall Street Italia went through all Internet cycles: boom, crisis, restructuring. In 2001 HdpNet, the media company controlled by [[RCS Media Group]] – [[Corriere della Sera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2004/marzo/01/osservatorio_privilegiato_sulle_Borse_Usa_ce_0_040301162.shtml|title=L' osservatorio privilegiato sulle Borse Usa WallStreetItalia a 95 mila utenti}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the largest public media company in Italy) acquired 30,24% of WSI shares. After a "buy back" of RCS Media Group's shares and in spite of [[economic]] and [[financial crisis]] (the worst since the [[Great Depression]]), starting from 2008 WSI experienced a substantial increase in web traffic.

==Editorial Opinion==
''WSI'' main focus became in fact reporting all news related to the ferocious speculative attack, within the financial market, against [[Europe]]'s peripheral countries (the so-called [[PIIGS]]: Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain). During the summer of 2011 the website published extensive coverage about Italy and its government sovereign bonds (BTPs) under attack.

Furthermore, ''Wall Street Italia'' strongly criticized the malfunctions of Europe and its currency, the [[Euro]]; the recessionary consequences of austerity measures and high taxation applied to cash-strapped countries with huge public debt like [[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]; the unfairness and doubts about Brussels internal mechanisms and strategies, such as the [[European Stability Mechanism|ESM]] (European Stability Mechanism) and the Fiscal Compact.
