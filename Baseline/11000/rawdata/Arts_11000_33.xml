The '''Akto Festival for Contemporary Arts''' is a regional festival in [[Bitola]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. The festival includes visual arts, performing arts, music and theory of culture. The first Akto festival was held in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=15954&amp;rub=55 |title=Culture in Macedonia |access-date=2009-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034815/http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=15954&amp;rub=55 |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the festival is to open the cultural frameworks of a modern society through "recomposing" and redefining them in a new context. In the past, the festival featured artists from regional countries like [[Slovenia]], [[Greece]] or [[Bulgaria]], but also from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=25370&amp;rub=55 |title=Culture in Macedonia |access-date=2009-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034830/http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=25370&amp;rub=55 |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association for culture and art FRU – Faculty of things that can’t be learned works as a project platform in the area of contemporary art and culture, focused on event production whose purpose is to create critical engagement and active participation of citizens in the creation of the public socio-political discourse inside the community. 

One of FRU’s main activities is the annual AKTO Festival for contemporary art (started in Bitola, 2006), that has imposed itself as a serious part in promoting and producing new forms of influence on the civil consciousness, locally and regionally. AKTO Festival has been cooperating with several regional organizations in partnership projects, executing 9 editions so far, with the participation of about 300 artists, presented via numerous exhibitions, conferences, different kinds of events, etc. such as festivals Perforacije (Zagreb), Culturescapes (Bazel) and the regional networks BCC / balcan can contemporary and  Urban Hum and the regional projects Listening to the Audience, LIVING LIBRARIES: archives of civil disobedience, If Buildings Could Talks etc.

Artistic director and president of FRU is Filip Jovanovski (artist, activist, and curator), and Ivana Vaseva (curator, and program coordinator of FRU). 

Pop UP AKTO is the new edition of AKTO Festival for contemporary arts – the last 10 years it was happening in August in Bitola (2006–2015) – transformed, renewed and reshaped. It stars its new journey not as an annual festival with 3 – day condensed program but as a series of mini curated festivals or festive events that pop up in different cities in Macedonia, starting from Stip, Skopje,Tetovo and Bitola.
Thematically, Pop UP AKTO is exploring the city environment and dwelling, its places of memory and the new adjectives attached to them as part of the city's transformation. It talks about the positive aspect of being in the city – on one’s own or being together and aims at promoting places of democratic expression on freedom and inclusion of citizens from experts to amateurs. 

The new cycle of AKTO Festival forms itself from the rethinking of its position as a festival that contributes towards the change of the current cultural and public policy, budget-wise, production-wise and distribution-wise.
The idea of this program of events in 3 cities stems to empower the local community to feel the cultural production in the country, share the experience and motivate to continue the ideas beyond this organizational structure.
It intends to make a network of citizens which will have two main missions: 
1. INSIDE to empower the local communities in each local context (the mayor being “father figure” having the total control in the city leaving unsatisfied citizens and young people immigrating)
2. OUTSIDE network of people and organizations that will share knowledge, experience and programs

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">'''Alien Kulture''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Punk rock|punk]] band active from 1979 through 1981, founded by Ausaf Abbas, Azhar Rana, Pervez Bilgrami, and self-described "token white" Huw Jones.  Inspired by the nascent punk scene, the [[Anti-Nazi League]] and the [[Rock Against Racism]] concert series, and wanting to express the frustrations of second-generation Asian immigrants during a period of ethnic tension and race riots in Britain, the members of the band turned to music to achieve politically what they had not been able to via protest rallies, and to draw on their Pakistani Muslim backgrounds to promote an Asian presence in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They took their name as a response to then newly elected Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] stated fears of being "swamped by people with a different culture".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to express themselves as youth caught between two cultures, they wrote songs about racism and issues within the Asian community, such as arranged marriage, leading to attacks both from neo-Nazis supporting the [[British National Front|National Front]] as well as other Asians who felt they were disgracing their community. The band eventually recorded one album plus a single, "Culture Crossover" b/w "Asian Youth", which was released by Rock Against Racism Records.  They attracted the support of famed BBC DJ [[John Peel]], who said he played them on air not just because they were Asian but because he liked their music.  However, they were otherwise ignored by mainstream media, and the group came to feel their music was not having the political effect they had hoped for. They declined an invitation to perform at a concert with The Specials at [[Brandon Stadium|Coventry Stadium]] in protest of racial profiling by police because Ausaf and Azhar were due to sit their finals exams at the [[London School of Economics]] that same day, and disbanded soon after, having played only 30 shows.

Today, Huw Jones works in the non-profit sector in Leeds, Pervez Bilgrami runs a successful recruitment agency with his wife, Azhar Rana is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants, and Ausaf Abbas is a financial advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

{{Expand Japanese|美人|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Kaigetsudo Ando Yasunori - Bijin.jpg|thumb|right|A ''bijinga'' painting of a courtesan, by [[Kaigetsudō Ando]], c. 1700 - 1720]]

{{nihongo|'''''Bijin'''''|美人}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term which literally means "a beautiful person" and is synonymous with {{nihongo|'''bijyo'''|美女|extra="beautiful woman"}}. Girls are usually called {{nihongo|'''bishōjo'''|美少女}}, while men are {{nihongo|'''bidanshi'''|美男子}} and boys are {{nihongo|'''bishōnen'''|美少年}}. The term originally derives from Chinese word 美人, the word 美人 is used widely in several Asian countries including [[China]], [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]], and [[Vietnam]].

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Bijin - Eizan.jpg|thumb|317x317px|Bijin woodblock print by Kikukawa Eizan, 19th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

==Meaning==

In practice the term ''bijin'' means "beautiful woman" because the first [[kanji]] character, ''bi'' (美), has a [[feminine]] connotation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E#Translingual  Translation of kanji character 美]&lt;/ref&gt; Bijin can also be translated as "a beauty"; in a modern and informal context it means "a doll". People who are called a bijin are usually beautiful, charming and harmonious women, who wear pretty clothes.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], 美人 ([[Pinyin]]: ''měirén'') also means "a beautiful woman".&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E4%BA%BA#Mandarin Translation of 美人 in Mandarin Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mandarin Chinese, in [[Korean language]], 美人 ({{ko-hhrm|미인||Miin}}) means "a beautiful woman".

==In Japanese art==
{{Main article|Bijin-ga}}

Pictures of bijin in [[Japanese art]] are called ''bijin-ga''. Bijin-ga is described as a genre of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings. Some of the greatest bijinga artists are [[Utamaro]], [[Suzuki Harunobu]] and [[Torii Kiyonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=izePWrWvE-MC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=bijin+ga+OR+bijinga+OR+Akita&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;redir_esc=y Tadashi Kobayashi, ''Utamaro: Portraits from the Floating World'', pages 89-92]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the 20th century, ''bijin-ga'' were very popular.

==Average Beauty Theory==
Judith Langlois and Lori Roggman's cross-cultural study on beauty used composite faces suggests that attractive faces are those that represent the central tendency or average. Composite images were created by layering digital photographs of faces. Each image was smoothed, meaning that each pixel in the matrix was adjusted to the average value of the pixels immediately surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langlois|first1=Judith H.|last2=Roggman|first2=Lori A.|title=Attractive Faces Are Only Average|journal=Psychological Science|date=March 1, 1990|volume=1|issue=2|pages=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blood Cross''''' is one of American photographer [[Andres Serrano]]{{'}}s early religious-themed [[postmodern art|postmodernist]] images, released in 1985, two years before the controversial ''[[Piss Christ]]'' was debuted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1215">In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''bômolochus''''' ({{lang-grc|βωμολόχος}}) was one of three [[stock character]]s in [[ancient Greek comedy|comedy]], corresponding to the English [[buffoon]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''bômolochus'' is marked by his wit, his crudity of language, and his frequent non-illusory audience address.

'''Casa Presei Libere''' (meaning ''House of the Free Press'') is a building in northern [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], the tallest in the city between 1956 and 2007.

A [[horse racing|horse race track]] was built in 1905 on the future site of Casa Presei Libere. A third of the track was removed in 1950 to make way for a wing of the building, and the race track was finally closed and demolished in 1960, after a decision by [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/825200/Povestea-unei-lumi-disparute-cursele-de-cai-din-Romania/ "Povestea unei lumi dispărute: cursele de cai din România"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021200554/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/825200/Povestea-unei-lumi-disparute-cursele-de-cai-din-Romania/ |date=October 21, 2008 }}, ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1952 and was completed in 1956. The building was named ''Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii "I.V.Stalin"'' and later ''Casa Scînteii'' (''[[Scînteia]]'' was the name of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s official newspaper).  It was designed by the architect Horia Maicu, in the pure (albeit comparatively small-scale) style of [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet]] [[Socialist realism]], resembling the main building of the [[Moscow State University]], and was intended to house all of Bucharest's printing presses, the newsrooms and their staff.

It has a foundation with an area of 280x260m, the total constructed surface is {{convert|32000|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and it has a volume of 735,000 m³. Its height is {{convert|91.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} without the television antenna, which measures an additional {{convert|12.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;''Dicţionarul Enciclopedic Romîn'', 1962&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the total height to {{convert|104|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Between 1952 and 1966, Casa Scînteii was featured on the reverse of the 100 [[Romanian leu|lei]] banknote.

On 21 April 1960, a giant statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]], made by Romanian sculptor Boris Caragea, was placed in front of the building. However, this statue was removed on 3 March 1990, following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;"Epilog la o statuie", ''[[România Liberă]]'', 4 March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue's pedestal is still there.

It has basically the same role nowadays, with many of today's newspapers having their headquarters in the same building, now renamed ''Casa Presei Libere'' ("The House of the Free Press"). The [[Bucharest Stock Exchange]] (''Bursa de Valori București'', BVB - in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) was located in the southern wing at one point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6402">[[Image:Chinesisches Haus Sanssouci.jpg|thumb|The Chinese House]]
The '''Chinese House''' (German: ''Chinesisches Haus'') is a garden pavilion in [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] had it built, about seven hundred metres southwest of the [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Summer Palace]], to adorn his flower and vegetable garden. The garden architect was [[Johann Gottfried Büring]], who between 1755 and 1764 designed the pavilion in the then-popular style of [[Chinoiserie]], a mixture of ornamental [[rococo]] elements and parts of Chinese architecture.

The unusually long building time of nine years is attributed to the [[Seven Years' War]], during which Prussia's economic and financial situation suffered significantly. Only after the end of the war in 1763 were the chambers inside the pavilion furnished. As the building served not only as a decorative piece of garden architecture but also as a setting for small social events, Frederick the Great ordered the building of a ''Chinese Kitchen'', a few metres south-east of the Chinese House. After a conversion in 1789, only the [[hexagonal window]]s show the Oriental character of the former outbuilding. A few years later, the [[Dragon House (Sanssouci)|Dragon House]] was built in the form of a Chinese [[pagoda]] on the northern edge of Sanssouci Park bordering Klausberg. The building was Frederick the Great's attempt to follow the Chinese fashion of the 18th century, which began in France before spreading to England, Germany, and Russia.

[[Image:Ehemalige Chinesische Küche.jpg|thumb|right|The former ''Chinese Kitchen'' following its conversion]]

== Chinoiserie ==
In the 17th century, Dutch traders brought Chinese [[nacre|mother-of-pearl]], lacquer, silks and porcelain to Europe. In the noble courts of the [[baroque]] era, an interest in Oriental arts grew during the [[rococo]] period into Chinoiserie, a genuine fashion for all things Chinese. In addition to the enthusiasm for Asian luxury goods which harmonized with the certain forms of rococo, travelogues and exhibitions portrayed the carefree living of the Chinese, which corresponded with the European courts' ideal of a relaxed lifestyle. Whole rooms of palaces were decorated with porcelain, small Chinese-style furniture and wall murals which presented the ideal world that was supposedly China.

== Architecture ==
Frederick the Great modeled the Chinese House on the ''Maison du trefle'', a 1738 garden pavilion in the palace grounds of [[Lunéville]], France. This [[trefoil]]-shaped building was created by the French architect [[Emmanuel Héré de Corny]] for the Duke of Lorraine, [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], former King of Poland, who lived in exile in France. An exemplar of one of the etchings of the ''Maison'' published by Héré in 1753 was in the possession of Frederick the Great.

=== Outer design ===
[[Image:Teehaus1.jpg|thumb|right|Northern entrance to the Chinese House]]
The Chinese House has the shape of a trefoil. The rounded central building contains three cabinet rooms regularly interspersed with free spaces. Rounded windows and French windows that reach almost to the ground let light into the pavilion's interior. The rolling tented copper ceiling is supported in the free space by four gilded [[sandstone]] columns, the work of the Swiss ornamental sculptor [[Johann Melchior Kambly]], who was in the employ of Frederick the Great from 1746.

The gilded sandstone sculptures that sit at the feet of the columns and stand at the walls of the rooms originate from the workshops of the sculptors [[Johann Gottlieb Heymüller]] (ca. 1715-1763) and [[Johann Peter Benckert]] (1709-1769). People from the area stood as models for the eating, drinking and music-making Chinese figures, which explains the statues' European features.

The [[cupola]] crowning the roof is surmounted by a gilded Chinese figure with an open parasol. Friedrich Jury created it in copper after a design by the sculptor [[Benjamin Giese]]. Light falls into the central chamber through the long oval window openings of the cupola as it does through the windows in the façade.

=== Interior design ===
The wall of the circular central chamber, accessible by the north side, is coated with [[stucco]] marble. Monkeys with musical instruments worked in stucco over the French windows, brackets holding porcelain and wall sconces between the windows are all coated with gold leaf. Likewise coated is a richly decorated chandelier which hangs from the cupola.

The ceiling painting on the higher circuit of the room is the work of Thomas Huber, dating from 1756. Huber also painted the ceilings of the empty chambers on the exterior surface. The plans of the French artist [[Blaise Nicholas Le Sueur]], who taught as an art master at the [[Berlin Academy of Arts]], served as a model for the interior. The ceiling paintings show Oriental men behind a balustrade, some looking into the room, others chatting with one another. They are surrounded by parrots, monkeys and [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] sitting on posts.

The walls between the central room and the adjoining chambers are decorated with brightly coloured, silken wall coverings painted with floral patterns, at the time a desired and valuable wall textile known as "Pekings". As may be seen here, Frederick the Great preferred to use for the interiors of his buildings only the highest quality materials manufactured by Prussian silk factories. Small fragments of this wall covering were used as a model for the reconstruction of the original during a restoration of 1990&amp;ndash;1993.

'''Christian Vigilius Blache''' (1838–1920) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] marine painter. After studying at the Academy under [[C.F. Sørensen]], he travelled widely painting ships and seascapes throughout Denmark as well as in Scotland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. He was an early visitor to [[Skagen]] in the north of [[Jutland]] where an artists' colony was to emerge a little later.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Aarhus]], Blache was the son of the headmaster of the Cathedral School. After matriculating from high school in 1857, he first served an apprenticeship in shipbuilding. He entered the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1861 where he studied under [[C.F. Sørensen]], graduating in 1867. He travelled widely in Europe in 1872.&lt;ref name=hb&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=140&amp;wsektion=alle Henrik Bramsen, "Christian Blache"], ''Kunstindeks Danmark &amp; Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 31 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Blache View from the beach in Skagen 1869.jpg|thumb|275px|Christian Blache: ''Sailboats on the sea, view from the beach in Skagen'' (1869)]]
Blache belonged to the younger generation of Denmark's classical marine painters but had studied under one of the earlier masters, C.F. Sørensen. Like his colleagues, he had a good knowledge of ships and chose subjects mainly from home waters and coasts. He travelled through the whole of Denmark, painting many acclaimed works of the west coast of Jutland. Some of his more dramatic paintings depict scenes of stormy weather. He travelled to Paris in 1878 to see the paintings in the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|World Exhibition]]. His paintings include scenes of [[Skagen]], Scotland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland.&lt;ref name=hb/&gt;

From 1863, he exhibited in [[Kunsthal Charlottenborg|Charlottenborg]] and continued to do so almost every year until 1920, exhibiting over 200 paintings in all. In 1888, he was awarded the [[Eckersberg Medal]].&lt;ref name=hb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Christian_Blache?highlight=christian%20blache "Christian Blache"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his most notable works are ''Fra Begtrupvig ved Hels'' (1864) and ''Panserskibet Ivar Huilfeldt passerer Forbjerget Stat i en Storm'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Marinemaler/Christian_Blache?highlight=christian%20blache "Christian Blache"], ''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skagen==
Blache was one of the first artists to visit [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]] where an [[Skagen Painters|artists' colony]] emerged in the late 1870s. It was as a result of his influence that [[Holger Drachmann]] first visited the town in 1871.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">A '''cross-genre''' (or '''hybrid genre''') is a [[literary genre|genre]] in [[fiction]] that blends themes and elements from two or more different genres. As opposed to the (literary and political) conservatism of most [[genre fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; cross-genre writing offers opportunities for opening up debates and stimulating discussion.

Such hybrid genres are not new but a longstanding element in the fictional process: perhaps the most famous example is [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', with its blend of poetry, prose, and engravings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singer/W. Walker, ''Bending Genre'' (2013) p. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s trilogy [[Poena Damni]] ([[Z213: Exit]], [[With the people from the bridge]], [[The First Death]]) combines fictional prose with drama and poetry in a multilayered narrative developing through the different characters of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/reviews-march/ |title=Reviews: Z213: Exit by Dimitris Lyacos &amp;#124; Write From Wrong Literary Magazine |publisher=Writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic discontinuites==
[[Fredric Jameson]] has highlighted the progressive elements in Third World Literature that defies genre expectations such as [[Xala (novel)|Xala]]; and in [[science fiction]] like ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' with its exploration of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weekes eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 334 and p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Koontz]] considers himself  a cross-genre writer, not a [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer: “I write cross-genre books-suspense mixed with love story, with humor, sometimes with two tablespoons of science fiction, sometimes with a pinch of horror, sometimes with a sprinkle of paprika...”&lt;ref&gt;Koontz, Dean.

'''''Demon's Souls'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|デモンズソウル|Demonzu Souru|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] for the [[PlayStation 3]]. It was published in Japan by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in February 2009, in North America by [[Atlus USA]] in October 2009, and in Australia and Europe by [[Namco Bandai Games]] in June 2010. It was the first installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games created by game director [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] and was produced under supervision by [[SIE Japan Studio|Sony's Japan Studio]].

Set in a [[dark fantasy]] world, players take control of a hero who has journeyed to the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, which is being ravaged by a cursed fog that brings forth demons who feast on the souls of mortals. The game was described as a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[King's Field (series)|King's Field]]'' series of games, while at the same time being described as a separate entity from it. The gameplay involves a character-creation system and emphasizes gathering loot through combat with enemies in a non-linear series of varied locations, with a heavy emphasis on challenging combat. It has a unique online multiplayer system integrated into the single-player where players can leave useful messages and warnings for other players' single-player game worlds, as well as joining other players in their world to assist and/or kill them.

Upon its release, ''Demon's Souls'' was met with acclaim from critics, winning numerous awards. The game was praised for its dark fantasy art design, variation in combat choice and integrated online interactions, and its high [[difficulty level]], with many critics noting it as a genuine challenge. The game ''[[Dark Souls]]'', which itself spawned two sequels, is a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Demon's Souls'', and was also one of the primary inspirations for ''[[Bloodborne]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Demon Souls Screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|The player confronting a red dragon. The light tint around the player character indicates that they have previously died resulting in a reduced health bar and stronger foes]]

Players take control of the main character who, at the start of the game, can be customized by choice of gender, appearance, name and starting class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 starting classes, ranging from knights and barbarians to thieves and mages. Each class has its own starting statistics, gear, weapons and type of magic used which all emphasize certain approaches to combat depending on the player's preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As players kill demons, they gain souls which act as currency that can be used to buy, repair, and upgrade weapons as well as increase player statistics such as strength, luck, and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with souls, players can retrieve items such as weaponry and ore for upgrading. When a player is killed during a level, they are sent to the beginning of the level with all non-[[boss (video game)|boss]] enemies re-spawned, and the player returns in soul form with lower maximum health and the loss of all unused souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player manages to reach their bloodstain at the point where they were last killed, they regain their lost souls. However, if they are killed before then, the souls are lost permanently. Upon defeating a boss, the player can choose to re-spawn back to that location, marked in the form of an Archstone. When not exploring a level, players reside in the Nexus, a realm of souls that acts as a hub where players can exchange souls, store items and travel between regions. After completing the initial portion of the first region, players can choose to progress through any other of the newly available regions.&lt;ref name="GSReview"/&gt;

Gameplay can change depending on both the World and Character tendency, which can be either white or black. Tendency depends on the actions of the player such as helping or killing [[non-player character|NPCs]]. When white, enemies are easier, yet the soul and items rewards are fewer; when black, enemies are stronger and give greater rewards. Players can manipulate their tendency to suit their current needs. Character tendency affects the player throughout, while World Tendency only affects the region where an action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further emphasizing the challenging nature of the game is the increased difficulty upon [[New Game Plus|completion of the story]]. After finishing the game, the player may choose to continue playing from the beginning, except with a 40% increase in difficulty. Subsequent completions increase the difficulty further by 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/newgame-plus|title=Newgame Plus|accessdate=2010-10-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808124137/http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/newgame-plus|archivedate=2010-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online ===
When connected to the [[PlayStation Network]], online play is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout levels, players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that when activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially helping the player avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the floor that can also help others such as forewarning safe or hostile positions, trap locations and tactics against enemies or bosses, among general comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-operative play allows up to three characters to team up in the host's game world where visiting players appear in soul form that can only be returned to their bodies when a boss is defeated. In competitive play, players can invade a player's adventure as a Black Phantom to engage in combat with the host player. If the Black Phantom kills the host, they can be returned to their body in their own game, whereas if killed themselves, the host gains a portion of the Black Phantom's souls as well as the phantom losing a player level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American servers were originally scheduled to be shut off on October 11, 2011, however Atlus decided a month before to keep the servers running until May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demon's Souls Going Offline Next Month, In North America|url=http://www.ps3trophies.org/news/news-6398-Demon-s-Souls-Going-Offline-Next-Month--In-North-America.html|publisher=PS3T|accessdate=12 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113080535/http://www.ps3trophies.org/news/news-6398-Demon-s-Souls-Going-Offline-Next-Month--In-North-America.html|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days prior to the servers shutting down in May, Atlus made another announcement stating that the servers would stay up for the foreseeable future, provided user activity and interest remain constant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news10.net/entertainment/gameguys/article/194937/99/Plan-to-end-Demons-Souls-server-support-scrapped Plan to end Demons' Souls server support scrapped] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926001334/http://www.news10.net/entertainment/gameguys/article/194937/99/Plan-to-end-Demons-Souls-server-support-scrapped |date=2012-09-26 }}. news10.net.

== Plot ==
The game is set in a kingdom called Boletaria, ruled by the aging King Allant XII. Because of his greed, the king began to channel the power of souls, bringing unprecedented prosperity to Boletaria, until the "Deep Fog" covered the land's outskirts, cutting off the kingdom from the outside world. Neighboring kingdoms sent scouts to investigate but none returned after entering the fog.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' King Allant the twelfth, by channeling the power of souls brought unprecedented prosperity to his northern kingdom of Boletaria. That is until the colorless Deep Fog swept across the land. Boletaria was cut off from the outside world, and those who dared penetrate the Deep Fog never returned. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after Vallarfax of the royal Twin Fangs broke free from the fog that the rest of the world could be told of Boletaria's plight. By channeling souls, King Allant had awakened the [[Old One in fiction#Demon.27s Souls|Old One]], a great demon residing below the Nexus. This created the fog, and unleashed more demons within it that feasted on the souls of mankind, while those left alive without a soul became insane and violent. Without resistance, the fog slowly begins to spread beyond Boletaria.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' But Vallarfax of the royal Twin Fangs broke free from the fog and told the world of Boletaria's plight. That the Old King Allant had aroused the Old One, the great beast below the Nexus, from its eternal slumber. And that a colorless fog had swept in, unleashing terrible demons. The demons hunt down men and claim their souls. Those who lose their souls, also lose their minds. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maiden in Black and Old One.jpg|right|thumb|The Maiden in Black beckons to the Old One]]
Many brave warriors attempted to breach the fog and save Boletaria, while others were tempted by the prospect of harnessing the demon's souls; either way, many were lost to the fog.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' ...the power of a mature demon's soul is beyond human imagination. The legend spread quickly. Mighty warriors were drawn to the cursed land but none have returned. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player takes control of one such warrior who breaches the fog and enters the lost kingdom;&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' But Boletaria has one final hope. A lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog. Has the land found its savior, or have the demons found a new slave? {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, after entering the palace botanical gardens, the protagonist is confronted by a vile demon, The Vanguard. If the protagonist manages to defeat the Vanguard, they are killed by the Dragon God, another massive demon with a draconic form. After dying, the protagonist, now in soul form, appears in the Nexus. In the Nexus, they are greeted by the Maiden in Black, a mysterious and blinded matron of the Nexus who gives them the quest to travel to each region of Boletaria and retrieve the demon's souls to gain power and eventually free the corrupt kingdom of Boletaria from the Old One.&lt;ref&gt;'''Maiden in Black:''' Souls of the lost withdrawn from its vessel. Let strength be grant so the world might be mended... so the world might be mended. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One by one the protagonist slays the mighty demons, some of whom are the corrupt forms of Boletaria's heroic Round Table knights, that reside in many of Boletaria's notable locations; the Boletarian Palace, Stonefang Tunnel, Tower of Latria, Shrine of Storms, and Valley of Defilement. It is also in these places where they encounter the few remaining great men and women of Boletaria. Once the protagonist claims all the demon's souls and has killed the Arch Demons of each area, the Maiden in Black leads them down below the Nexus to the Old One itself. The Maiden in Black beckons the Old One, who invites the protagonist inside where the now-deformed King Allant XII remains.&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' You have been chosen by the Old One. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final battle Allant claims that because of humanity's own violence and suffering, the Old One is acting mercifully by putting "an end to our tragic realm of existence."&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' Surely you have seen for yourself the pain and suffering that fills this world!  But fight poison with poison.. God is merciful, and so, created the Old One. The Old One will feed upon our souls, and put an end to our tragic realm of existence! {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Allant's defeat, his last words are a warning to the protagonist: "You fool. Don't you understand? No one wishes to go on."
&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' You fool. Don't you understand? No one wishes to go on. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the end of the game the protagonist makes one last choice either to slay or to walk away from the Maiden in Black. If the protagonist walks away, they have not succumbed to the temptation of the souls. The fog is lifted and the Maiden departs with the Old One back into the fog into its slumber once again, saving Boletaria and the rest of the world, although the souls consumed remain lost for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' The Old One, along with the maiden, were swept back into the lulling fog. Boletaria was spared from the demons, but also lost its knowledge of soul arts. The souls lost during the pandemonium were never retrieved. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the Maiden in Black is killed, they have become lustful for the power of souls, condemning the world with the protagonist as its ruler at the side of the Old One.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' The Old One sensed a new and powerful demon by its side. And before long, the world will be engulfed by the Deep Fog... Bring more souls! {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
According to game director [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], before the start of the two-year development period,&lt;ref name="GIinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|title=Demon’s Souls Director Discusses Difficulty, Sequels, And More|author=MTV Video Games|publisher=MTV|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2010-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209205242/http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|archivedate=2010-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the studio had previously ruled out the following game to be a new installment in the [[King's Field (series)|''King's Field'' series]].&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Instead, [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment Japan]] producer Takeshi Kajii described the game as a "[[spiritual successor]]" to FromSoftware's earlier series, ''[[King's Field]]'',&lt;ref name="1UP.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3170272 |author=Kevin Gifford |title=Sony Reveals Demon's Souls |publisher=[[1UP.com|1UP]] |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679led3sU?url=http://www.1up.com/news/sony-reveals-demon-souls |archivedate=2012-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he stated "I am a fan of From Software, but naturally that also means there are parts of their games I'm not satisfied with, too," explaining the development choice as an opportunity to be more creative and potentially innovative, stating "If this was a new ''King's Field'' game, there would be areas we wouldn't be able to touch since they're part of the series; working together like this, we can try to make something really new."&lt;ref name="1UP.com"/&gt; He added, "''King's Field'' was the game that sparked the idea for the ''Demon's Souls'' project, but we didn’t base it completely off of that game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2460092/demons-souls-producer-talks-inspiration-and-future-plans/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409022028/http://www.mtv.com/news/2460092/demons-souls-producer-talks-inspiration-and-future-plans/ |archivedate=2017-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Miyazaki stepping in, the project was internally considered a failure, with the team being unable to create a compelling prototype. Miyazaki, who up until then had only worked on the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series, eventually took full control of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-01-demons-souls-was-a-failure-before-miyazaki-stepped-up |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164931/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-01-demons-souls-was-a-failure-before-miyazaki-stepped-up |archivedate=2017-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He "changed pretty much everything about" the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/ico-showed-bloodborne-s-hidetaka-miyazaki-the-possibilities-of-the-medium--289853.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214002347/https://www.destructoid.com/ico-showed-bloodborne-s-hidetaka-miyazaki-the-possibilities-of-the-medium--289853.phtml |archivedate=2017-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a separate entity from ''King's Field'', with a different perspective and "guided by differing core game design concepts."&lt;ref name="RollingStone"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mielke|first1=James|title='Dark Souls' Creator Miyazaki on 'Zelda,' Sequels and Starting Out|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/dark-souls-creator-miyazaki-on-zelda-sequels-w443435|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=6 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005123700/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/dark-souls-creator-miyazaki-on-zelda-sequels-w443435|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not consider it a "successor" to ''King's Field'', stating that, while "''King's Field'' was the beginning of the ''Demon's Souls'' project, I wouldn't go as far as to say that we had ''King's Field'' in mind while we were making ''Demon's Souls''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor?page=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524095629/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor?page=2 |archivedate=2017-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyazaki drew inspiration from [[video game]]s such as ''[[Ico]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/31/bloodborne-dark-souls-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-interview|title=Bloodborne creator Hidetaka Miyazaki: ‘I didn’t have a dream.

Miyazaki commented on the game's considerable difficulty as "never the goal", but rather a focus on creating a real sense of accomplishment. Difficulty was described as "one way to offer an intense sense of accomplishment through forming strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things."&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Game locations were described as "places of evil intent", such as the Tower of Latria embodying man-made evil, and the Valley of Defilement embodying natural evil, with the difficulty heightening the player's sense of dread.&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; The threat of death that sees players potentially losing all their hard-earned souls was also created to emphasize this mood, that "if the Souls could be recovered anytime, there would be no suspense or sense of accomplishment." Boss battles were primarily designed to be "varied and exciting" to make sure "players didn’t get tired of the same fight" and like the rest of the game "encourage them to figure out different tactics, to think on their feet."&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Takeshi Kajii felt that the boss battles were not the hardest element; "You say boss, but it’s not just the boss. It’s everything including the road up to the boss that makes this game really hard. If you find patterns to destroy the boss, it’s not that hard. It’s how you get to the boss that makes this a difficult game."&lt;ref name="siliconerainterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/07/10/demons-souls-director-didnt-think-demons-souls-was-that-hard/|title=Demon’s Souls Director Didn’t Think Demon’s Souls Was *That* Hard|publisher=Siliconera.com|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2009-07-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713072612/http://www.siliconera.com/2009/07/10/demons-souls-director-didnt-think-demons-souls-was-that-hard/|archivedate=2009-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyazaki said that the game's [[Balance (game design)|difficulty]] was inspired by the [[trial and error]] difficulty of [[Retrogaming|retro video games]].&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Keza|title=Souls Survivor|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=21 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319020959/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing the integrated online feature, Miyazaki felt many new games had what he considered "too much communication in online games which can become a burden for some people," instead integrating the online experience subtly, with certain online elements like the ghostly figures of other human players adding to the dark mood of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps3hyper.com/news/demons-souls-director-i-wanted-it-to-be-easier-no-plans-for-sequel-yet/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421171858/http://www.ps3hyper.com/news/demons-souls-director-i-wanted-it-to-be-easier-no-plans-for-sequel-yet/ |archivedate=2009-04-21 |title=Demon’s Souls Director: "I Wanted It To Be Easier", No Plans For Sequel Yet|publisher=PS3Hyper|date=2009-04-20|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When implementing the system of allowing players to leave useful messages, instead of allowing players to write a message, a list of pre-written messages was chosen; not only to make the process quick and easy to use since players cannot pause gameplay, but also was to prevent the system from becoming "a large chat, which detracts from the feel of the world."&lt;ref name="siliconerainterview"/&gt;

The game's asynchronous multiplayer system was inspired by a personal experience by Miyazaki, where a car in front of him had stopped on an icy hillside and began to slide downward.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; The car following Miyazaki also began to slide, with the one behind it helping to push the cars up the hill, which then Miyazaki and others also successfully did.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Unable to give his appreciation to the drivers before leaving the area, he wondered whether the last person in the line had made it to their destination, thinking that he would probably never meet the people again.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Miyazaki called the experience a "connection of mutual assistance between transient people", which then heavily inspired the game's use of cooperation between players who do not directly communicate.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; The concepts of an in-game messaging system, shared play experience, and mutual role-playing were inspired by [[text messaging]] and [[retro gaming]], particularly the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games.&lt;ref name="dq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/08/dark-souls-online-play-to-bring-back-the-feeling-of-old-dragon-quest-games/|title=Dark Souls online play to bring back the feeling of old Dragon Quest games|work=VG247.com|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185933/http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/08/dark-souls-online-play-to-bring-back-the-feeling-of-old-dragon-quest-games/|archivedate=30 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Wanting to remove the ease of communication, Miyazaki explained that everyone was forced to work together when gaming up in the 1980s to help each other due to the lack of easily accessible information at the time, a process he was a fan of.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt;

The game's approach to storytelling was inspired by Miyazaki's experiences of attempting to understand English books he could not read. Because he could not read English, he created his own stories by interpreting what was in the pictures. This inspired him to make a game where players don't understand what's going on, and must interpret things as they play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="It Has to Be Personal" Says 'God of War' Creative Director Cory Barlog|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/it-has-to-be-personal-says-god-of-war-creative-director-cory-barlog-w488948|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release ===
''Demon's Souls'' was announced in late 2008 and was only dated for a release in Japan, which would later cover localized versions for other parts of east Asia, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/Demons-Soul-dated-for-Japan--a0005427-p0.php|title=Demon's Soul dated for Japan|author=MTV Video Games|publisher=PlayStation Universe|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2010-02-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lfIMl6?url=http://www.psu.com/Demons-Soul-dated-for-Japan--a0005427-p0.php|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release in Japan and Asia on February 5, 2009 was by Sony Computer Entertainment, who did not have any plans to release the game elsewhere. Following the game's Asian release and positive reception, in May Atlus announced plans to publish ''Demon's Souls'' in North America, promoting the game at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]] (E3) before eventually being released in North America on October 7 that year. The North American version runs on separate online servers, with players of that version not being able to interact with people playing on other regional versions. The same applies to saved games and trophy sets; saves from Asian versions will not work with the North American version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/07/06/playstation-eye-chat-demons-souls|title=PlayStation Eye Chat: Demon’s Souls|website=Official PlayStation.Blog|author=Jeff Rubenstein|publisher=Sony|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lgot9E?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/07/06/playstation-eye-chat-demons-souls/|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a separate trophy list is installed from the Asian releases, despite the trophy content being identical.

Regarding a possible European release, [[Eurogamer]] contacted Atlus USA over the matter where their spokesperson Aram Jabbari gave the statement "I'm not aware of any plans/publishers for bringing the game to Europe at this time. Hopefully the game continues to generate word of mouth and positive critical reception and a European publisher takes notice." Additionally, other publishers known for releasing From Software and Atlus games in Europe like [[Tecmo Koei]] and [[Ubisoft]] said they had no plans to release ''Demon's Souls''.&lt;ref name="Euro Release"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Purchese |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/demons-souls-uk-release-uncertain |title=Demon's Souls UK release uncertain News |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307021137/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/demons-souls-uk-release-uncertain |archivedate=2010-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, [[Namco Bandai Games]] announced plans to release ''Demon's Souls'' in Europe, with the limited edition released on June 25, 2010.&lt;ref name="LEeurorelease"&gt;{{cite web

In September 2010, Atlus announced that ''Demon's Souls'' would be released in North America under the [[Sony Greatest Hits]] label with a price cut following strong sales, higher than previously expected by the publisher.&lt;ref name="greatesthits"&gt;{{cite web |author=Tom Goldman |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103514-Demons-Souls-Price-Slashed-By-Gigantic-Halberd |title=Demon's Souls Price Slashed By Gigantic Halberd |publisher=[[The Escapist Magazine]] |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2010-11-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028132339/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103514-Demons-Souls-Price-Slashed-By-Gigantic-Halberd |archivedate=2010-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trilogy of [[spiritual successor]]s developed by FromSoftware, ''[[Dark Souls]]'', were released throughout the 2010s.&lt;ref name="Dark Souls not Demon's Souls sequel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/287123/news/dark-souls-is-not-a-sequel-to-demons-souls-dev/ |title=Dark Souls 'is not a sequel to Demon's Souls' – Dev |author=Andy Robinson |date=February 4, 2011 |work= |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |accessdate=February 5, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207143727/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/287123/news/dark-souls-is-not-a-sequel-to-demons-souls-dev/ |archivedate=February 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Merchandise and other media ==
Upon its release in North America, ''Demon's Souls'' was also released with a Deluxe Edition in a slipcase, along with a 150-page guide book. Prior to the game's release, at the time pre-orders from [[GameStop]] for either the standard or Deluxe version included an official soundtrack disc and art book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5308286/demon-souls-dated-and-bundled-with-swag|title=Demon Souls Dated And Bundled With Swag|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Kotaku|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206145758/http://kotaku.com/5308286/demon-souls-dated-and-bundled-with-swag|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some copies of the strategy guide however were reported to have "unusual cover ink wear/fading". Having realized this mistake, Atlus responded by launching a temporary replacement program for defect copies on their official website, along with an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61230|title=Atlus Launches Demon's Souls Strategy Guide Replacement Program|author=Chris Faylor|publisher=Shack News|date=2009-11-12|accessdate=2010-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923050122/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61230|archivedate=2010-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a special edition was released in Europe called ''Demon's Souls: Black Phantom Edition''. Like the North American Deluxe Edition, it contains an art book, soundtrack CD and strategy guide.&lt;ref name="officialeurorelease"/&gt; The strategy guide part of the Black Edition was put together by Namco Bandai Games for no additional production costs with the help of the editors of the fan supported Demon's Souls Wiki hosted by [[Wikidot]], which supported information on each aspect of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5520094/demons-souls-pal-release-has-fan+made-strategy-guide|title=Demon's Souls PAL Release Has Fan-Made Strategy Guide|author=Luke Plunkett|publisher=Kotaku|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-06-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528162208/http://kotaku.com/5520094/demons-souls-pal-release-has-fan+made-strategy-guide|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release in Japan, ''Demon's Souls'' was generally well received by critics. ''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki]]'' scored the game 95/85/85/85, adding up to 350 out of 400, saying that "fans of old-school games will shed tears of joy." ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it 29 out of 40 (9/7/7/6), with an editor Paint Yamamoto scoring it a 9 and calling it "a game you learn how to play by losing – you'll face sudden death frequently. But! Keep playing... and you'll realize how deep it really is." However, another editor, Maria Kichiji, gave it a 6 and found the game to be "far too stoic... it's not a game for everybody."&lt;ref name="Dengeki and Famitsu Scores"&gt;{{cite web |first= Nick |last= Des Barres |title= Japan Review Check: Demon's Souls |url= http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172516 |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522222939/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172516 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2016-05-22 |date= 2009-01-28 |publisher= [[1UP.com]] |accessdate= 2010-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release in North America, the game received critical acclaim with an average critic score of {{Video game review score|reviewer=mc|system=PS3|proseScore=yes}} at [[Metacritic]]. Despite the game's high difficulty, many reviewers found it to be a positive aspect, making the game more rewarding to play. [[GameSpot]] called the high difficulty "fair", saying players will "undoubtedly take a lot of damage until you learn the subtleties of fighting each enemy, but combat feels just right."&lt;ref name="GSReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/rpg/demonssoul/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review |title=GameSpot Demon’s Souls Review – Brutally challenging and utterly engrossing, this innovative role-playing game is one of the year's best. |publisher=GameSpot |author=Kevin VanOrd |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105034921/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/rpg/demonssoul/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Bread-review |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] echoed this view, encouraging players who "can remember the good ol' days when games taught through the highly effective use of negative reinforcement and a heavy price for not playing it carefully should scoop this up instantly."&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1033437p1.html|title=IGN Demon’s Souls Review – One of the most rewarding, challenging PS3 games finally hits the US.|publisher=IGN|author=Sam Bishop|date=2009-10-09|accessdate=2010-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lwjqgr?url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1033437p1.html|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' called it "one of the first truly great Japanese RPGs of this generation, and certainly the most remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/20/review.aspx|title=Game Informer Demon’s Souls Review – From Software Gives RPG Players Tough Love|publisher=Game Informer|author=Phil Kollar|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2010-01-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679m1dNOg?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/20/review.aspx|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' however, while commending the game overall, said ''Demon's Souls'' was "best left to the most masochistic, hardcore gamer."&lt;ref name="OPMReview"&gt;{{cite journal | date=December 2009|title=PlayStation: The Official Magazine (US) Demon's Souls|publisher=PlayStation: The Official Magazine|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the game's release in Europe, European critics reviewed import copies.

''Demon's Souls'' favorable review scores made the fiscal performance of the game unique because of the lack of a supporting marketing campaign. Gaming analyst [[Jesse Divnich]] commented "''Demon's Souls'' is probably one of the most statistically relevant games released in the gaming world as it helps answer an often asked question: how much would a high quality game sell if it was supported by no mass marketing, released by a little known publisher, and was a new intellectual property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Analysts predict cold October for game industry |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/analysts-predict-cold-october-for-game-industry/1100-6239455/ |author= Tom Magrino |date= November 10, 2009 |accessdate= October 31, 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171130091505/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analysts-predict-cold-october-for-game-industry/1100-6239455/ |archivedate= November 30, 2017 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success of the game, Sony Computer Entertainment VP of international software Yeonkyung Kim later admitted that it was a "mistake" to pass on the game, instead allowing Atlus to publish it, initially due to concerns over its difficulty and unusual design decisions.&lt;ref name="2010sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index-hd.com/up_images_m/files/20100412.pdf |script-title=ja:2010年8月期中間決算説明会 |publisher=Index Holdings |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2010-08-02 |format=PDF |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024622/http://www.index-hd.com/up_images_m/files/20100412.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''design sprint''' is a time-constrained, five-phase process that uses [[design thinking]] with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. It has been developed through independent work by many designers, including those within [[GV (company)|GV]] (formerly, Google Ventures), and those at Boston-Based User Experience Agency Fresh Tilled Soil. Two books have been published on the approach so far - one by Jake Knapp with co-authors John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprintbook.com/|title=About|website=The Sprint Book by Jake Knapp with John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another by C. Todd Lombardo, Richard Banfield, and Trace Wax&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640422|title=Design sprint : a practical guidebook for building great digital products|last=Richard,|first=Banfield,|others=Lombardo, C. Todd,, Wax, Trace,|isbn=9781491923146|edition= First|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=922640422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[GV (company)|GV]], the Design Sprint concept developed from a vision to grow UX culture and the practice of design leadership across the organization. Multiple teams within Google experimented with different methods from traditional UX practice, IDEO, the Stanford dSchool and a range of other disciplines. 
The process aims to help teams to clearly define goals, validating assumptions and deciding on a product roadmap before starting development. It seeks to address [[Business strategy|strategic issues]] using interdisciplinary, rapid [[Software prototyping|prototyping,]] and [[Usability testing|user testing]]. This design process is similar to [[Sprint (software development)|Sprint]]s in an [[Agile software development|Agile]] development cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/getting-started-with-design-sprints/|title=Off To The Races: Getting Started With Design Sprints – Smashing Magazine|website=Smashing Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible uses ==

Claimed uses of the approach include

* Launching a new product or a service.
* Extending an existing experience to a new platform.
* Existing [[Minimum viable product|MVP]] needing revised [[User experience design]] and/or [[User interface design|UI Design]].
* Adding new features and functionality to a digital product.
* Opportunities for improvement of a product (e.g. a high rate of [[Abandonment rate|cart abandonment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shopify.com/blog/8484093-why-online-retailers-are-losing-67-45-of-sales-and-what-to-do-about-it|title=Why Online Retailers Are Losing 67.45%  of Sales and What to Do About It – Shopify|website=Shopify's Ecommerce Blog - Ecommerce News, Online Store Tips &amp; More|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Phases ==
The creators of the Design Sprint approach, recommend preparation by picking the proper team, environment, materials and tools working with six key 'ingredients'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672889/from-google-ventures-the-6-ingredients-you-need-to-run-a-design-sprint|title=From Google Ventures, The 6 Ingredients You Need To Run A Design Sprint|website=Co.Design|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Understand:''' Discover the business opportunity, the audience, the competition, the value proposition, and define [[Key Performance Indicator|metrics of success]].
# '''Diverge:''' Explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility.
# '''Converge:''' Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding.
# '''Prototype:''' Design and prepare prototype(s) that can be tested with people.
# '''Test:''' Conduct 1:1 [[Usability testing|user testing]] with (5-6) people from the product's primary [[target audience]]. Ask good questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/03/11/ask-good-questions|title=Ask good questions|last=Matveeva|first=Maria|date=March 10, 2015|website=Dockyard|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deliverables ==
The main deliverables after the Design sprint:
* Answers to a set of vital questions
* Findings from the sprint (notes, user journey maps, storyboards, information architecture diagrams, etc.)
* Prototypes
* Report from the user testing with the findings (backed by testing videos)
* A plan for next steps
* Validate or invalidate hypotheses before committing resources to build the solution

== Team ==
The suggested ideal number of people involved in the sprint is 4-7 people&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GV|title=Kevin Rose talks 'Sprint' with GV's Jake Knapp and Daniel Burka|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1HBqlxQjZI|accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they include [[Facilitator|the facilitator]], [[designer]], a decision maker (often a [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] if the company is a [[Startup company|startup]]), [[product manager]], [[engineer]] and someone from companies core business departments (Marketing, Content, Operations, etc.).

 {{Disability}}
}}
'''Disability in the arts''' is an aspect within various arts disciplines of [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive practices involving disability]]. It manifests itself in the output and mission of some [[theatre|stage]] and [[modern dance]] performing-arts companies, and as the subject matter of individual works of art, such as the work of specific painters and those who draw.

Disability in the arts is distinguished from [[disability art]] in that it refers to art that includes people with disabilities, whether in themes, performance, or the creation of the artwork, rather than works focusing on disability as the central theme. It{{specify|date=February 2014}} can also refer to work that is made as a political act toward shaping a new community, fostering [[disability culture]]:
{{quote
|Disability culture is the difference between being alone, isolated, and individuated with a physical, cognitive, emotional or sensory difference that in our society invites discrimination and reinforces that isolation – the difference between all that and being in community. Naming oneself part of a larger group, a social movement or a subject position in modernity can help to focus energy, and to understand that solidarity can be found – precariously, in improvisation, always on the verge of collapse.
|Petra Kuppers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuppers|first=Petra|title=Disability Culture and Community Performance: Find a Strange and Twisted Shape|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave|location=Houndmills and New York|isbn=978-0-230-29827-9|page=109|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=504063}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

People with disabilities sometimes participate in artistic activities as part of [[expressive therapy]] (also known as "expressive arts therapy" or "creative arts therapy"). Expressive therapy may take the form of [[writing therapy]], [[music therapy]], [[drama therapy]], or another artistic method. While creativity and artistic expression are parts of expressive therapy, they are secondary to the goal of achieving a therapeutic benefit. This article describes disability in the arts where artistic achievement is the primary goal.

==Performing arts ==

===Dance===

{{main|Physically integrated dance}}

[[File:LisaBufanoOrangeQueenAnneTableLegProstheses.jpg|thumb|[[Lisa Bufano]] performing on her signature orange Queen Anne table legs.]]
The '''physically integrated dance''' movement is part of the [[disability culture]] movement, which recognizes the first-person experience of disability. This means disability is integrated not as a [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] construct but as a [[Social model of disability|social phenomenon]], through artistic, literary, and other creative means.&lt;ref&gt;Pelka, Fred (1997). ABC-CLIO Companion to the Disability Rights Movement. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO. p. 97. {{ISBN|0-87436-834-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuppers|first=Petra|title=Disability Culture and Community Performance: Find a Strange and Twisted Shape|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave|location=Houndmills and New York|isbn=978-0-230-29827-9|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=504063|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Django Reinhardt (Gottlieb 07301).jpg|thumb|Jazz guitarist and composer [[Django Reinhardt]] became a top-selling recording artist. He developed new guitar techniques used by many guitarists today.]]
[[File:Melody Gardot (1).jpg|thumb|Singer [[Melody Gardot]] used music as therapy to improve her memory while recovering from a [[traumatic brain injury]]. She later became a top-selling jazz vocalist, and now tours internationally.]]

[[Beethoven]] is remembered for his ability to compose classic music after completely losing his hearing. He tried several ways of using his deteriorating hearing before it completely disappeared. He had the legs of his [[pianoforte]] cut off, so that it was sitting directly on the floor. By lying on the floor in front of the keyboard, he could feel vibrations while he played, helping him to compose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Helen|title=Beethoven for Kids: His Life and Music With 21 Activities|year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781569767115|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different attempts were made to help Beethoven with [[adaptive technology|adaptive]] or assistive technology.  [[Thomas Broadwood]], the [[Johann Andreas Streicher|Streichers]], and [[Conrad Graf]] were all piano manufacturers who tried different methods of adapting the instrument to make it louder for Beethoven: [[ear trumpet]]s were attached to the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]], [[resonance]] plates were added to the underside of a piano, and using four strings for every key were all tried. Beethoven ultimately lost all hearing, and could no longer rely on an instrument to help him compose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Edwin M.|title=Giraffes, Black Dragons, and Other Pianos: A Technological History from Cristofori to the Modern Concert Grand|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804745499|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beethoven composed his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] at this time in his life.

Belgian jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] was a 20-year-old, accomplished guitarist when his left hand was severely burned in a house fire, leaving him with only the use of two fingers for playing the [[fretboard]] on the neck of the guitar. While he recovered from his burns, his brother gave him a new guitar. Reinhardt devised his own physical therapy, practising daily to stretch his fingers. He also invented new techniques to compensate for the lost fingers: {{blockquote|Instead of playing scales and [[arpeggio]]s horizontally across the fretboard as was the norm, he searched out fingerings that ran vertically up and down the frets as they were easier to play with just two fingers. He created new chord forms using a minimum of notes—often just triads with his two good fingers on the bass strings. He pushed his paralyzed fingers to grip the guitar as well, his smallest digit on the high E string, his ring finger on the B, and sometimes barring his index finger to fashion chords of four to five notes. He then slid his hand up and down the fretboard, employing these chord forms to craft a fluent vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Dregni"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dregni|first=Michael|title=Django: The Life And Music Of A Gypsy Legend|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195304480|pages=47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Reinhardt continued to work as a guitarist, and became world-famous as a recording artist. Reinhardt's creative techniques became part of the jazz guitar repertoire.&lt;ref name="Dregni"/&gt;

[[Melody Gardot]], a jazz vocalist, suffered a [[traumatic brain injury]] after she was hit by a car while riding a bicycle. Gardot's injury impaired her memory, including her ability to speak. She spent a year recovering in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=French |first=David |date=March 2007 |title=Melody Gardot: Philadelphia Story |journal=Jazz times |volume=37 |issue=1-5 |pages=30–1 |url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/18685-melody-gardot-philadelphia-story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329001505/http://jazztimes.com/articles/18685-melody-gardot-philadelphia-story |archivedate=March 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in hospital, her therapy required her to relearn the process of completing simple tasks, such as remembering to shut off a water tap after brushing her teeth. Remembering words to complete sentences was a challenge for Gardot. A doctor suggested that Gardot try singing sentences as an alternative to speaking them, as a way of improving her ability to remember longer sentences. Gardot discovered that this method improved her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markle|first=Sandra|title=Wounded Brains: True Survival Stories|year=2011|publisher=Lerner Publications|isbn=9780761363101|pages=40–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardot gained a music following by adding recordings of her music to Myspace in 2006. Gardot is now a world-famous recording artist, in both French and English, and gives concerts around the globe. She sometimes still has memory lapses while performing, and Gardot needs to wear sunglasses to protect her light-sensitive eyes. She carries a cane as she occasionally experiences [[vertigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Enrique|title=Wisher, Washer, Wishy-Washy|year=2008|publisher=PositivePsyche.Biz|isbn=9780615252407|pages=126–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, British composer [[Charles Hazlewood]] formed the [[British Paraorchestra]], an [[orchestra]] that aims to consist entirely of skilled disabled musicians to counter his belief that orchestras do not contain enough disabled musicians. The formation of the orchestra was the subject of a [[Channel 4]] documentary, and it also performed during the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra&gt;{{cite news|title=Coldplay join the paraorchestra of disabled musicians for closing ceremony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/orchestra-disabled-people-play-paralympics?newsfeed=true|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 September 2012|location=London|first=Maggie|last=Brown|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the [[One Handed Musical Instrument Trust]] has the objective of removing the barriers to music-making faced by the physically disabled. It comments: "There is currently no orchestral instrument that can be played without two fully functioning hands and arms, denying unlimited participation in musical life to those with congenital disabilities and amputees, as well as the millions who may have been injured, suffered a stroke or developed arthritis. The primary obstacle is the absence of suitable instruments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmi.org.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{main|Theatre and disability}}
In modern times, the treatment of disability in theatre works has reflected an evolution in mainstream social attitudes towards disability. In Western culture, disability was once rarely mentioned in plays. Notable exceptions include Shakespeare's ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. The character of Richard III was depicted as "deformed, unfinish'd" has served as an example of an "[[anti-hero]]" and illustrated the depiction of people with disabilities in the arts as villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9809671/Richard-III-Visions-of-a-villain.html|title=Richard III: Visions of a villain?|author=Smart, Alastair|website=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2013|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's physical disabilities are used to symbolize the fundamental weakness in his character. Yet Shakespeare was conscious of the common mistake of equating physical beauty with personal or moral qualities, or the reverse perception, that physical unattractiveness represents personal flaws (he satirizes such attitudes in his [[Sonnet 130]]). Richard III is portrayed as a complex character, one whose tragedy is in surrendering to his moral weaknesses rather than overcoming them.

The inclusion of performers with disabilities in theatre has developed in tandem with wider public acceptance of integrating people with disabilities in mainstream society. French theatre actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was already famous when she had a leg amputation at age 71. She continued her acting career. Bernhardt disliked her prosthetic limbs and chose to use a sedan chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavendish|first1=Richard|title=Sarah Bernhardt's Leg|journal=History Today|date=February 2015|volume=65|issue=2|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/sarah-bernhardts-leg|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped]] (NTWH) was a [[repertory theatre]] company based in New York City that worked in advocacy, training, and production in theatre for performers with disabilities. It was primarily inclusive of performers and playwrights with physical disabilities when it was founded in 1977. NTWH oversaw projects such as the Writers’ Program for Wounded Warriors, which served as both a therapeutic and artistic program for war veterans to explore the psychological, emotional and spiritual experiences of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coronado|first=Christa|title=Father Richard Curry, S.J.: The Perfection of Eloquence|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/by-topic/education/father-richard-curry-s-j-the-perfection-of-eloquence/5248/|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2012|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Famous People Players]], founded in 1974, is a touring black light theatre company based in Toronto, Canada, that employs people with disabilities as performers and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous PEOPLE Players Dine &amp; Dream Theatre|url=http://www.seetorontonow.com/listings/famous-people-players-dine-dream-theatre/|website=See Toronto|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable 20th-century plays have dealt directly with disability. American playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] wrote many plays with female leads who were at least in part inspired by his sister Rose, who was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], and then left severely disabled by a [[lobotomy]] as a young woman. Characters who reflect Rose's struggle with mental illness include Laura in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', [[Blanche DuBois]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and Catherine in the screenplay Williams wrote for the 1959 film ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. In Williams' plays, such women are seen as suffering tragedy as a result of their illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schvey |first1=Henry |date=2011 |title=The Tragic Poetics of Tennessee Williams |journal=Études Anglaises |volume=61 |issue=1 |page=74 |url=https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/tragic-poetics-tennessee-williams |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heilman |first1=Robert Bechtold |date=1977 |title=Tennessee Williams' Approach to Tragedy |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Gershe]]'s ''[[Butterflies Are Free (play)|Butterflies Are Free]]'', about a young blind man who wins his independence from an overprotective mother, debuted on Broadway in 1969, was made into a film in 1972. The main character was played by non-blind actors in both the original run of the play and the film version. In contrast, the play ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'', written by [[Mark Medoff]] and debuting in 1980, included a deaf actress playing the female lead role of a character who is deaf. This continued in [[Children of a Lesser God (film)|the 1986 film version]]; [[Marlee Matlin]], who is deaf, won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. In addition, the play ''Spring Awakening'', a production by Deaf West and which debuted in 2015 on Broadway, featured a large cast of Deaf actors. The play featured both hearing and Deaf actors that performed using American Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Considine|first=Allison|date=November 1, 2015|title=Ready, Willing, and Able|url=|journal=American Theater Group|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phamaly performs at the [[Denver Performing Arts Complex]] and the Aurora Fox Theatre.  The company's season also includes various touring and educational shows.

====Theater Breaking Through Barriers====
[[Theater Breaking Through Barriers]] (TBTB - formerly Theater By The Blind) is an Off-Broadway, all-[[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive]] [[theater company]] in [[New York City]] dedicated to advancing the work of professional actors, writers and directors with disabilities.&lt;ref name="TBTB-1"/&gt;  Founded by Ike Schambelan in 1979, TBTB began as a company of sighted actors hired to record plays for the blind. In 1982, the theater incorporated and began creating showcases, which mixed blind, low-vision and sighted performers.  By 1985 the troupe began producing full stage productions featuring integrated casts of blind/low vision and sighted actors for blind and sighted audiences.  In 2008, TBTB expanded their mission to include all performers with disabilities and officially changed their name from TBTB - Theater By The Blind to TBTB - Theater Breaking Through Barriers to reflect the expansion.&lt;ref name="TBTB-2"/&gt;

==Film==
{{For|the depiction of disability in documentary film|Disability in the media}}
For filmmakers and audiences alike, there is an unspoken appeal for disabled people on screen.  Films have an impact in shaping society's views of specific groups.  For films with disability, these views and stereotypes are drawn from social institutions and norms in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norden, Martin|authorlink1=The Hollywood Discourse on Disability|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several influential pieces of writing that predate film which include disability:
* [[Moby-Dick]], Captain Ahab's sole purpose is to take revenge on the whale that made him disabled.

&lt;!--[[File:X-johnnybelindalenda48-jjp.jpg|thumb|A poster for the [[melodrama]] film ''[[Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948). The deaf-mute main character used [[sign language]] in a mainstream film for the first time.]]--&gt;

Film in disability typically involves the portrayal of one disability or another in a way that is meant to communicate a specific message or perspective. Many films strive to create a sense of inclusiveness and awareness, thereby eliminating the apparent social stigma associated with disability. Many films aim to trigger discussion and other forms of engagement revolving around disability.

Independent disability film is often screened on a larger scale during disability film festivals. [[ReelAbilities]], for example, acts to “[promote] appreciation and awareness of the lives, stories and artistic expressions of people with various disabilities.”&lt;ref name= "RA"&gt;"ReelAbilities: Houston Disabilities Film Festival 2013." ReelAbilities: Houston Disabilities Film Festival 2013. N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; They additionally aim to “bring together our community to explore, discuss, embrace, and celebrate the diversity of our shared human experience.”

Disability in film has been a relatively recent phenomenon; as Hollywood has “kept its distance, favouring conditions such as blindness, deafness and discreet mental illnesses which exhibit no outward sign of deformity, though good-looking wheelchair users have proved acceptable.”&lt;ref name= "GUK"&gt;Cox, David. "Disability in Film: Is Cinema Finally Moving with the Times?" The Guardian. Guardian News and Media, 23 July 0012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar David T. Mitchell, it was nearly thirty years ago that “a resurgence of concern over the consequences of dehumanizing representations (monster, freak, madman, suffering innocent, hysteric, beggar) resulted in suspicion over the ultimate utility of representational studies about disability.”&lt;ref name= "DTM"&gt;Mitchell, David T., and Sharon L. Snyder. Narrative Prosthesis: Disability and the Dependencies of Discourse. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2001. P. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell further discusses the shift to altering the social perception of various disabilities in the public sphere.

Disability has been portrayed in film since the era of silent cinema. Disability may be an essential [[plot (narrative)|plot]] element or make a significant contribution in another way as part of the [[screenplay]]. The experiences of disabled war veterans were often the basis of early films that dealt with disability. ''[[The Light That Failed]]'', a popular short story by British author [[Rudyard Kipling]], was filmed in 1916, 1923 and 1939. The [[protagonist]], a veteran gradually losing his eyesight, became in many ways a template for many films that would portray disabled veterans as tragic victims. Films in this pattern include ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]]'' (1950), starring [[Marlon Brando]], and ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)]]'' (1971), an anti-war film directed by [[Dalton Trumbo]]. Other early films established the pattern of portraying disabled soldiers as "noble warriors", confronting and overcoming both physical disability and society's lack of understanding upon their return home. Some examples include ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944), and the groundbreaking ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1945). ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' tells the story of several veterans who are disabled in battle, then return home to face their own bitterness and the challenge of reintegrating into society as men with a disability. Some members of the film industry opposed the decision to cast [[Harold Russell]], a real-life veteran who lost both hands in a training accident, stating that it was in "poor taste". However, the film was popular with audiences, and Russell was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], as well as "a special Oscar for 'Bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans'".&lt;ref name="Benshoff-2011"/&gt;

Early portrayals of women with disabilities rarely strayed from an image of an innocent, sheltered young woman. Even a nuanced film like [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) follows this pattern. This film tells the story of the Little Tramp's efforts to help a blind flower girl with whom he falls in love. The film was radical in challenging the audience at the end of the film to take the point of view of someone blind, to metaphorically "see" beyond their prejudices towards others. The melodrama ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948), which depicts an innocent young deaf woman raped and then defending herself from an attempted murder, does little to give the lead character any depth beyond being a typical "plucky" and brave hero. Yet, the film was notable for bringing [[sign language]] to mainstream film audiences for the first time,&lt;ref name="Benshoff-2011"/&gt; and for making a woman with a disability the main character and allowing her to triumph over adversity. ''[[Children of a Lesser God (film)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' (1986) shattered the stereotype of the innocent young woman with a disability. The character Sarah is independent, strong-willed, and often fails to recognize what is in her own best interests. [[Marlee Matlin]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and was an exception to the general rule that only non-disabled actors would appear in high-profile film roles depicting someone with a disability.

Disabled actors that are older, over 40 more specifically, are more likely to be chosen for roles in films, compared to their younger counterparts. This suggests that the perception of the disability in film becomes more acceptable as one gets older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raynor|first=Olivia|last2=Hayward|first2=Katharine|date=2009-03-01|title=Breaking into the business: experiences of actors with disabilities in the entertainment industry|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-3802.2009.01114.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1111/j.1471-3802.2009.01114.x|issn=1471-3802}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[ReelAbilities]], is an annual film festival in the United States screening films about disability issues.

===Plot===
*''[[Sur mes lèvres]]'' features a heroine who is introduced immediately with a shot of her putting her earpiece in. Carla ([[Emmanuelle Devos]]) is by no means weak-willed, but her partial [[deaf]]ness makes it more distressing to watch her cope with her job as an overworked and under-appreciated secretary. It is only when she faints from the exhaustion of picking up after her unpleasant coworkers that Carla accepts the boss's offer of an [[intern]] assistant. She rapidly falls in love with her new colleague, an ex-[[convict]], and ends up colluding with him in an outlandish scheme.
*''[[Rory O'Shea Was Here]]'', about a young rebel man with [[muscular dystrophy]] who tries to help a fellow young man with [[cerebral palsy]] follow him in the arts of "getting drunk and getting laid". Rory dies at the film's end, but his mission has been accomplished: his friend with CP has successfully been taught [[self-determination]], and carries on the legacy.

*In ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', teenager Grace ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) loses her lower right leg in a riding accident which also leaves her horse traumatised. The film portrays the physical and mental recovery of both horse and rider after her mother ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]) drives them from New York to Montana to meet "[[natural horsemanship|horse whisperer]]" [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref name="THWh"/&gt;
*The 2010 Chinese film ''[[Ocean Heaven]]'' is about an autistic son.&lt;ref name="Ocean"/&gt;
* In ''[[Rust and Bone]]'', [[Marion Cotillard]] plays Stéphanie, an orca trainer who loses her legs after an accident at the marine park she works. Stéphanie, now in a wheelchair, is terminally depressed and starts a relationship with Ali [[Matthias Schoenaerts]], who brings her back to life.

===Screenplay===
In the 2009 science fiction film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the [[paraplegic]] protagonist ([[Sam Worthington]]) experiences a new freedom as a fully mobile human-alien hybrid (avatar).

[[Spencer Tracy]] plays a handicapped war veteran in ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]''. He steps off the train at the almost-deserted desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time the train has stopped there in four years. The remaining inhabitants are unaccountably hostile, but Tracy proves that one good arm is all you need to win a fight.

=== Film by era===
Disability in film can be categorized into three eras: [[silent film]] to the 1930s, 1940s to the 1970s, and post 1970s.
==== Silent films to the 1930s ====
One of the first disability films is Thomas Edison's ''Fake Beggar'' in 1898.  This short film of fifty seconds, is about a fake beggar who poses as blind, but is eventually caught by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Cinema of Isolation|date=1994|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-2103-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early depictions of the disabled involved criminality and freak shows.  In this era, scientist tried to rationalize and catalog people’s abnormalities,for example Francis Bacon attempt in 1620 to Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hillaire actualized catalog in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Angela|title=Hideous Progeny|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15717-9|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[Cesare Lombroso]], a criminal anthropologist, drew a direct correlation between body and mind as a sign of degeneracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Angela|title=Hideous Progeny|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15717-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea points to a common trope, one of the disabled criminal.  Furthermore, these early films coincided with the accepted idea of [[eugenics]] at the time, leaning heavily towards the [[medical model of disability]].
* [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]] contains the trope of the insane hypnotist, Dr. Caligari, as a criminal and villain.  The disabled insane criminal in this film also touches on another stereotype, the one of the disabled person exacting revenge on the non-disabled world.  This reaction assumes the nefarious character also has a loss of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Longmore|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the expressionist style of shooting, gives the viewer a distinct perspective of a mentally disabled person.
* [[Freaks (film)]] is an exploitative film by definition.  This is achieved through the use of real disabled and freak show actors in the film.  Though director Todd Browning is able to show the humanity of the freaks through marriage, birth, community, and other aspects of being a human, the second half of the film reverts to a dehumanizing revenge scene.  The abnormal bodies are a metaphor for a lack of emotional and spiritual capacity, that the latter part of the film displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Longmore|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The freak show characters are also placed in the center framing of many shots, as spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Church|first1=David|title=Freakery, Cults Films, and the Problem of Ambivalence|journal=Journal of Film &amp; Video|date=2011|volume=63|issue=1|page=7|issn=0742-4671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1940s to the 1970s ====
This era of disability films can be described as post-war films.  The trope of the disabled alcoholic veteran in a wheelchair became passe.  The WWII and the Vietnam War were publicly perceived and reacted to differently, therefore representations of disabled veterans from these respective wars were also different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Disabled Vietnam Vet in Hollywood Films|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=1985|volume=13|issue=1|page=8|issn=0195-6051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Post-traumatic stress]] is a reoccurring theme in the 1970s, as action films that previously upheld American culture and values, no longer did as a result of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Keatthley|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[The Men (film)|The Men]] used paraplegic veterans of WWII. It documented the lives of returning veterans.  This film is able to move past veterans bound by wheelchairs and to show another side of their lives.  However, there are instances of characters in the film who speak about their disability in spite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Cinema of Isolation|date=1994|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-2103-3|pages=178–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[The Conversation]], private surveillance expert Harry Caul realizes that one of his recording jobs will result in a murder.  As a result, Harry refuses to hand over the recordings.  This leads him into a spiral of helplessness, where Harry is no longer in control of his precious privacy.  This exemplifies PTSD, as the protagonist is betrayed by authority and in a position of powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Keatthley|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|pages=105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Deer Hunter]] followed a group of returning veterans in varying conditions.  However, the stereotype of the helpless disabled veteran is not evident in this film.  Though for the much of the film the disabled character, Steven, is in a place of powerlessness.  In the last scene, the group comes together singing God Bless America and toasting, representing his return to group society and away from the helpless disabled person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Disabled Vietnam Vet in Hollywood Films|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=1985|volume=13|issue=1|page=19|issn=0195-6051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post 1970s ====
Contemporary films have attempted more nuanced and humanistic portrayals of the disabled.  One particular movement, [[Dogme 95]], attempted to change the standard narratives, aesthetics and productions of studio film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=Dogme 95 and disability identity on film|journal=Journal of Visual Art Practice|date=2013|volume=12|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Notable Examples:
* [[Lars and the Real Girl]] is about a withdrawn young man who has a relationship with his sex doll, who uses a wheelchair.  The townspeople are hesitant to accept Lars' companion, but eventually welcome her into the community.  The doll, Bianca, represents a wheelchair-user/disabled person, who is accepted.  Furthermore, Lars' uses the doll for the community to accept his disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markotic|first1=Nicole|title=PUNCHING UP THE STORY: Disability and Film|journal=Revue Canadienne d'Études cinématographiques / Canadian Journal of Film Studies|date=2008|volume=17|issue=1|pages=2–3|issn=0847-5911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Julien Donkey Boy]].  Where director [[Harmony Korine]] attempts to film a character with untreated schizophrenia in a nuanced perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=Dogme 95 and disability identity on film|journal=Journal of Visual Art Practice|date=2013|volume=12|issue=3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Dogme 95]] movement, it is shot in an unfiltered manner and anti-Hollywood style.  In addition, there are scene where disabled characters create artistic and creative performances, a divergence from disability tropes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=Dogme 95 and disability identity on film|journal=Journal of Visual Art Practice|date=2013|volume=12|issue=3|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Companies===
Some visual media companies have a particular focus on issues involving disability. Some examples follow.
* [[Digital Theatre Systems]] - Surround sound and DTS-CSS or Cinema Subtitling System, captioning for film theatres
* [[Narrative Television Network]] in Tulsa, Oklahoma, adds audio description (delivered by television broadcast, cable, satellite, and the Internet) to an existing soundtrack.
* [[Roaring Girl Productions]] is a professional media company based in Bristol, UK, which creates fresh representations of disability in its productions.&lt;ref name="Resistance-1"/&gt; Founded in 1999 by artist-activist Liz Crow, RGP's work tours internationally&lt;ref name="Resistance-2"/&gt; and has set new standards of good practice for the inclusion of disabled people in film production and as audiences.
* [[Audio Description Associates]] creates audio description services for theatre, media, and visual arts exhibitions.

[[File:Ketra oberlander yahoo independence 2011.jpg|thumb|Ketra Oberlander is a successful visual artist, despite having impaired vision.]]

===Disabled artists===
[[Adaptive technology]] is helping an increasing number of artists overcome challenges that would otherwise prevent them from fully exercising their creativity. Mobility impairments can be overcome with tools such as [[Wii Remote]], which allows users to create digital graphics and digital paintings. Computer technology can also help artists with restricted vision.

The creative use of adaptive or assistive technology in media can also provide ways for the visually impaired to enjoy visual arts. Audio devices are made available to visitors at some museums, galleries, and other cultural institutions, to provide an informative narration for visitors, whether or not they have a visual impairment. Audio narration for theatre, film or television provides necessary description, added between dialogue, for visually impaired audience members.

[[Conceptual art]] is also a way for disabled artists to engage in the arts, by using studio assistants to carry out the artist's creative vision. This is prevalent in current art practice, where several disabled artists have found success in this field.

A number of well-known visual artists have worked professionally despite the challenges of disability. Some include:
*[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], who had restricted mobility in his legs, and became famous for his paintings of 19th-century French dancers.
*[[Frida Kahlo]], an iconic Mexican feminist and painter, wore a body brace due to multiple severe body injuries, which she depicted in self-portraits.
*[[Claude Monet]], French [[Impressionist]] painter, gradually lost much of his vision from [[cataracts]]. His vision was left restricted to a mainly blue colour range, so he used a predominantly blue [[palette (painting)|palette]] in his later works, such as [[Water Lilies]].
*[[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch post-Impressionist painter, probably had [[bipolar disorder]]. Symptoms of [[hallucinations]] and [[psychosis]] that he experienced may have influenced some of his experiments with visual style in his paintings.
*[[Al Capp]], American cartoonist ([[L'il Abner]]), suffered a leg amputation at age nine, which was said to have influenced his sardonic humour.
*[[John Callahan (cartoonist)|John Callahan]], American cartoonist, began his career after becoming a [[quadriplegic]] in an accident at age 21.
*[[Chuck Close]], American painter, paralyzed in 1988, a [[quadriplegic]].
*[[Yinka Shonibare]], [[MBE]], British conceptual artist, diagnosed with [[Transverse Myelitis]]. [[Turner Prize]] nominee.
*[[Ryan Gander]], British conceptual artist, a [[wheelchair]] user with a long term [[disability]].
*[[Kathleen Morris]], Canadian [[Impressionist]] painter, had cerebral palsy and became one of the most well known woman modernist painters.
*[[Ketra Oberlander]] gradually lost much of her vision, including much of her colour perception (cone of the eye) and black-and-white perception (rod of the eye). She is now legally blind, although she retains a restricted degree of vision. In mid-life, she changed careers, becoming a professional artist. Oberlander is able to use computers to create digital graphics, and also paints in acrylics. She founded an art licensing company that helps mobility-impaired artists distribute their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketra Oberlander&amp;nbsp;– Artist|url=http://thebadassproject.com/ketra-oberlander/|publisher=The Badass Project|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Riva Lehrer]], an American artist with [[spina bifida]], [[Life drawing|draws and paints largely from life]].
*[[Angela de la Cruz]], London-based Spanish artist, paralysed following a stroke at the age of 40 and uses a wheelchair, [[Turner Prize]] nominee.
*[[Judith Scott (artist)|Judith Scott]], an American fiber sculptor with Down Syndrome.

==Literature==
[[File:Milton paradise.jpg|thumb|The title page of the first edition of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', 1668. [[John Milton]], who was blind, composed the epic poem by dictating it to assistants who [[:wikt:transcribe|transcribed]] it for publication.]]
[[Oral literature]], the oldest form of literature, can be enjoyed by anyone, including the deaf or hearing-impaired (depending upon their ability to [[lip reading|lip-read]]), and impaired verbal ability is the only impediment to [[storytelling]]. [[Homer]], the ancient Greek author of the verse epics the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]'', is believed to have been blind. This disability was no barrier to the challenge of composing, and reciting for others, his classic creations, which contain over 15,000 lines (''Iliad'') and 12,000 lines (''Odyssey''). The ''Iliad'' itself is divided into 24 "books" that each take around one hour to recite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Iliad by Homer in Live Performance|url=http://homerproductions.com/oldfiles/homer.html|publisher=Homer Productions|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of oral storytelling, and the greater ease with which verse stories are memorized and retold, helped [[John Milton]] compose the 17th-century epic English poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. Milton gradually lost most of his eyesight and dictated ''Paradise Lost'' to willing assistants who wrote it down for publication (a process called [[Amanuensis]]).

The shift in modern Western culture away from oral storytelling to the written and printed word has created a barrier for the visually impaired. Writing and self-editing prose writing is often impossible without the use of [[assistive technology]]. Software developed for the visually impaired, called [[screen readers]], enable users to hear a voice reading the user's choice of digital printed material, such as [[e-book]]s or Websites. [[Braille keyboard]]s enable users to type and edit using a computer. Assistive technology is also available to help users with a [[learning disability]], such as [[dyslexia]], that impairs literacy, to read and write more easily using computers.

Literature that includes disability as a theme has become more common in recent decades. In non-fiction, memoirs have raised mainstream awareness of the experiences of people with disabilities. Notable recent first-person accounts include ''[[My Left Foot (book)|My Left Foot]]'', written by painter and writer [[Christy Brown]]. First published in 1954, it describes his upbringing in Ireland, his challenges brought on by severe [[cerebral palsy]], and his early career. It was made into a [[My Left Foot (film)|popular film in 1989]], for which [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. American writer [[Jim Knipfel]] took a humorous, irreverent approach with ''Slackjaw'' (1999), a memoir in which he details his struggles in accepting the loss of his eyesight to [[retinitis pigmentosa]].

''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' is a collection of stories by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] about the [[brainship]] Helva. In a far future, young children with severe physical handicaps can be placed in a life-support shell and specially trained for tasks that a "normal" human would be unable to undertake. McCaffrey, who has described ''The Ship Who Sang'', an early work, as the best story she ever wrote, asked herself one day: "what if severely disabled people were given a chance to become starships?"&lt;ref name="McC-best"/&gt;

The historical novel ''[[Four Freedoms (novel)|Four Freedoms]]'' deals with the often overlooked contributions made by disabled persons to the war industry during [[World War II]].

==Accessibility of arts and cultural facilities and programs==
[[Accessibility]] is one component of serving the public that arts organizations may overlook. [[Universal design]] provides a means of including audience members, or participants, with disabilities. Some of the accessibility factors that cultural facilities and arts organizations can take into account include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts and Humanities Accessibility Checklist|url=http://www.nea.gov/resources/Accessibility/Planning/Step6.pdf|publisher=National Endowment for the Arts, United States Government|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* accessible seating integrated into the audience area;
* accessible production areas, such as the stage, backstage, and orchestra pit areas;
* audio description devices, film captioning, and even sign language interpreting;
* Signage indicating accessible entrances and elevators;
* Accessible height and design for displays, food services, and box office;
* Exhibition labels and printed materials can include [[braille]].
* Visiting a trained low vision Optometrists specializing in the advanced optic techniques that can improve the remaining vision a person with advanced eye disease, Low  vision doctors are trained to provide numerous techniques to help to the visually impaired a variety of optical, surgical and adaptive techniques to help one continue performing the field of art.

Adaptive or accessible technology is an innovative way of making traditional arts and cultural programs available to a larger audience that includes people with disabilities. For example, audio can be added to programs through live or pre-recorded captioning. Subtitling, audio description for broadcast programs, DVD and other home entertainment, and Internet projects, are some of the ways arts venues and groups can remove barriers faced by people with disabilities.

==Accessibility organizations for the arts==

===United Kingdom===
* [[Shape Arts]] is a charity based in London that develops opportunities for disabled artists.
* [[Carousel (charity)|Carousel]] is a learning disability led arts organization based in Brighton, working in music, radio, performance, digital media and film. 

===United States===
There are many government initiatives that support the participation of people with disabilities in arts and cultural programs. Most U.S. state governments include an accessibility coordinator with their state arts agency or regional arts organization. There are a variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and non-profit groups that support initiatives for inclusive arts and culture.
* [[National Endowment for the Arts' Office for Accessibility|Office for Accessibility]] at the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/resources/Accessibility/office.html |title=NEA Accessibility - NEA Office for Accessibility |publisher=Nea.gov |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Media Access Group at WGBH]]  [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] is the [[Public Television]] broadcaster for the Boston region. It has three divisions: the Caption Center, Descriptive Video Services (DVS), and the [[Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family National Center for Accessible Media]] (NCAM). WGBH pioneered accessible television and video in the United States.
* [[International Center on Deafness and the Arts]] provides education, training, and arts projects in areas such as theatre, arts festivals, museums, dance, distance learning, and children’s programming.
* [[Metropolitan Washington Ear]] is a non-profit organization founded in 1974 to develop projects that assist people with visual impairments. They have a program with Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., to advance audio description, a technique that uses trained narrators to provide descriptions of theatre or film action between lines of dialogue.
* [[Taping for the Blind]] provides free 24-hour radio programming, as well as custom recording, and audio description.

The '''International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival'''  is a [[theatrical]] event held annually in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]] during the first two weeks of May.  The 15th festival will be held from 7–20 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaytheatre.ie&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70% of the festival's content comes from outside Ireland.  The Festival has included productions from countries as diverse as [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Canada]] as well as strong representation from the [[UK]], [[Ireland]] and the [[United States]].  Festival 2016 saw the 3,500th performance of a Festival production since 2004.

==History==
The festival was founded in 2004 in order to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Dublin-born [[Oscar Wilde]] in his native city, and to encourage and develop concepts of gay theatre. The image of Oscar Wilde was first used as the official festival logo in 2006 and remains so today.  This image is combined with that of the green carnation, which is a gay symbol associated with both Oscar Wilde and homosexuality within the world of theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaytheatre.ie/about/about_our_logo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's patrons are Senator [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], writer [[Emma Donoghue]] and playwright [[Terrence McNally]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaytheatre.ie/about/festival_patrons/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The festival has continued to grow year on year and has been sponsored by various organisations including [[Arts Council (Ireland)|The Arts Council]], [[Dublin City Council]], Visit Dublin and [[The George, Dublin|The George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaytheatre.ie/about/friends_and_supporters/|title=Friends and Supporters List {{!}} International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival|website=www.gaytheatre.ie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its official website, the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival provides "theatrical and academic fora for the presentation of new and exciting works by gay authors, or works that have a gay character, theme, relevance or other input by a gay artist to promote visibility and recognition of gay people's contribution to the arts nationally and internationally."

== Venues ==
The festival is held in many venues across Dublin City Centre, including Outhouse, The Teacher's Club, The Players Theatre at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and The Pearse Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaytheatre.ie/festival/venues/|title=Maps &amp; Venues {{!}} International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival|website=www.gaytheatre.ie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the film|I Was Monty's Double (film)}}
[[File:IWasMontysDouble.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. Rider and Company)]]
'''''I Was Monty's Double''''' (released in the US as '''''The Counterfeit General Montgomery'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1789274884&amp;searchurl=an%3DJAMES%252C%2BM%2BE%2BCLIFTON%26sortby%3D3 AbeBooks: "The Counterfeit General Montgomery" - James, M. E. Clifton] Retrieved 2012-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book by [[M. E. Clifton James]], first published in London in 1954. It was made into [[I Was Monty's Double (film)|a film]] in 1958, directed by [[John Guillermin]], from a screenplay adapted by [[Bryan Forbes]].  It tells the story of [[Operation Copperhead]]: James had an uncanny resemblance to [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|General Montgomery]] in real life, and he was used to impersonate Montgomery to confuse the Germans during the [[Second World War]].

==Film vs book==
The film broadly follows the account by James in his book of the same name, but according to James, there was no attempt to kidnap him. The German High Command did plan to have him killed, but Hitler vetoed the plan until he could be sure where the landings would actually take place.

Gibraltar was in reality a hotbed of German agents, and James/Montgomery was spied on by several operatives who were smuggled into Gibraltar specifically to discover what "Monty" was up to. James/Montgomery deliberately talked nonsense about non-existent operations and plans, in the hope that the spies would overhear and take such information seriously.

==Satires==
* ''[[The Goon Show]]'' broadcast a parody episode entitled [http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/ajwills/raw/series09/s09e02.html ''I Was Monty's Treble''] on 10 November 1958 (9th series, show 2).
* In 1959, [[Cecil Parker]] and [[Leslie Phillips]] appeared in a [[Parody|spoof]] version, ''[[The Night We Dropped a Clanger]]'' (known as ''Make Mine a Double'' in the U.S.), alongside [[Brian Rix]]. 
* The 1961 film ''[[On the Double (film)|On the Double]]'', starring [[Danny Kaye]], was also a take-off of ''I Was Monty's Double'', in which Kaye plays the twin roles of the General and the private who (comically but successfully) impersonates him.
* The 1989 [[Jason Connery]] film ''[[Casablanca Express]]'' freely borrows from the original tale, but with Churchill as the kidnap target. [[Glenn Ford]] appears briefly as a character resembling Gen. Williams.
* British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' carried a spoof version of the [[War Picture Library]] graphic novels entitled "Battle for Britain", a satire on then-current British political issues, most notably the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]].  The author was credited as "Monty Stubble", a [[pun]] on Monty's Double.

Since 2010, the name 'Monty's Double' has been adopted by the actor Colin Brooks-Williams as the identity for his popular Field-Marshal Montgomery lookalike and impersonation act, with which he tours 1940s-themed events nationwide ; as a tribute to the Field-Marshal himself and to M.E.Clifton James (the original war-time 'Monty's Double'). Colin has registered the name 'Monty's Double' as his professional stage name with the actor's union 'Equity' and carries the name on his Equity membership card.

'''''Synopsis''''', also known as the '''''Kievan Synopsis''''' ({{Lang-ru|Синопсис, албо Краткое описание о начале русскаго народа}}) is work of history, first published in [[Kiev]] in 1674. It interprets history through a [[Christian conception of time]] focused on the narratives of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], [[fall of man|fall]], and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatseel.org/100111/pdf/5a7_2_rikoun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also had a political purpose to justify the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] which annexed the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] while also claiming a central role for the city of Kiev.

[[Innokentiy Gizel]] is generally considered to be the author of ''Synopsis'', however this is arguable. ''Synopsis'' was the first textbook on the subject of history written in any [[Slavic language]].{{fact|date=December 2017}} It was rather popular until the mid-19th century and survived some thirty editions. 

The book began with the history of the origins and lifestyle of the [[Slavic people|Slavs]] and ended with the mid-17th century in the first edition. The second and third editions (1678 and 1680) end with the [[Chigirin Campaigns]] of 1677-1678. ''Synopsis'' covers the history of [[Kievan Rus']], the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], and the struggles against the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]], [[Ottoman Turkey]], and [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]]. The author of the ''Synopsis'' asserted that the Russian [[tsar]]s were the legal successors of the [[Kiev]]an [[grand prince]]s. ''Synopsis'' is notable since it clearly demonstrates that the idea of uniting all [[East Slavic people]] under the authority of one state was born not in [[Moscow]] but in the south-western lands of former [[Kievan Rus']] and designed in Kiev.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The purpose of the work is to "achieve a precarious balance between glorifying the Muscovite tsar on the one hand and defending Kiev’s own claims to power on the other."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatseel.org/100111/pdf/5a7_2_rikoun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The appendix of the ''Synopsis'' contains lists of Russian princes, [[Poland|Polish]] [[Voivode]]s in [[Little Russia]], [[Cossack]] [[hetman]]s, and Kievan [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s.

'''Luminous Interactive''' digital art platform was the brainchild of [[Lend Lease Group]] in collaboration with [http://ramus.com.au/portfolios/luminous-darling-quarter/ Ramus Illumination], and is billed, according to the [[Wall Street Journal]], as 'the world's biggest interactive permanent light display'. It was officially opened in the Darling Quarter Precinct in [[Sydney Central Business District]] (CBD) on 18 May 2012. 

Luminous at Darling Quarter is a permanent platform solely for illuminated digital 'art' – both animated and static. The 'canvas' extends over four levels of two campus-style buildings, covering 557 windows in total, and presents a digital façade spanning a distance of 150&amp;nbsp;metres. The artistic and design direction was set by international light artist [https://darlingquarter.com/play/luminous/ Bruce Ramus,] with Ramus studio responsible for design management and production of the work. Fixtures were manufactured by Australian architectural lighting specialists Klik Systems using advanced [[LED]] systems.

==Interactive==
[[File:LuminousDarlingQuarter17.jpg|thumb|upright|Interactive technology by iion, in collaboration with Ramus Illumination, activates the canvas and gives Luminous a social/web presence]]

Interactive content is available from 6pm, Friday through Sunday, with touch screen kiosks in [[Tumbalong Park]] allowing the general public to paint their own digital designs and play over-scaled arcade games on the buildings in front of them. Web surfers can also play using their smart phone or contribute on their computer through a dedicated website. The online component of Luminous has similarities to [[Project Blinkenlights]], a Berlin digital light installation, but expands the concept for the general public, allowing user-friendly interaction in an unprecedented way.

==Luminous concept==

The [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] occupying the buildings is joint partner in the project along with the [[Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority]] and [[Lend Lease]]. The consortium selected Bruce Ramus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ramus.com.au/profile/|title=Profile - Ramus|work=Ramus|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first artist, Artistic Director and Lighting Designer for Luminous. Canadian-born Ramus made his name lighting stage shows for [[U2]] and [[David Bowie]], and is design mentor for [[Sydney Opera House]].

==Technology==

At Darling Quarter, each window forms a 'pixel' in the canvas, lit with Klik Systems's energy efficient LEDs, and seen from a distance can form a coherent animated picture. A sophisticated colour palette is available thanks to white LEDs added to the standard RGB (red, green, blue) colours. The system is also capable of integrating music: graphic synchronization allows for sound-based designs to be visualized on the canvas.

Contrary to many light installations, direct light is minimized to viewers, instead using the automated timber louvers to reflect light from Klik System's linear LEDs (running along the windowsills, angled upwards with a 10-degree spreader lens). The entire project offsets almost all its energy use, thanks to photo-voltaic panels on the roof of both Darling Quarter buildings. The project allegedly uses the same power as 5 household vacuum cleaners.

==Darling Quarter==

Lend Lease designed and constructed Darling Quarter for owner APPF Commercial and first proposed the idea of a permanent space for illuminated art. Darling Quarter precinct includes a community green, children’s playground, and a large number of world-food restaurants, cafes and bars, and reflects Lend Lease’s enthusiasm for iconic new spaces for future generations.

The digital façade is in action six evenings a week. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, displaying ‘soft’ images (such as clouds or waves). On Friday, Saturday and Sunday 'Luminous' displays interactive artworks that aim to invite debate and make art critics – and artists - of every citizen and visitor. 

Sydney has a growing reputation for light shows, particularly due to the annual VIVID Sydney festival and the SPARC DESIGN lighting conferences at the Museum of Modern Art, which are regularly sponsored by Klik Systems and other long term supporters in the Australian lighting industry. Vivid Sydney was inaugurated in 2008, curated in 2010 by [[Laurie Anderson]] and [[Lou Reed]] and is billed as an international [[carbon-neutral]] festival of Light, Music and Ideas. The 2012 musical line-up includes [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Florence &amp; The Machine]].

The '''''Madonna Standing''''' (or '''''Madonna al latte''''') is a small painting by the Flemish artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]] dating from about 1430–1432. It is the left panel of a diptych held in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] (KHM), Vienna since 1772. The right panel portrays [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] and is also attributed by the KHM to van der Weyden, but is inferior in quality and generally regarded as by a workshop member.&lt;ref name= "Catherine"&gt;Panofsky, p. 251 and n. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel shows the Madonna and Child standing in a painted niche. The architecture of the [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]'s contains biblical and heavenly figures rendered in [[grisaille]], including [[God the Father]], the [[Holy Spirit]] represented by a dove, and Adam and Eve. The painting is influenced by [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Ghent altarpiece]], which the younger artist probably saw after he moved to Ghent around 1432. Borrowings from van Eyck include the positioning of a living figure in a [[niche (architecture)|niche]], separating Adam and Eve across panels, and placing figure of God leaning on the frame.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The ''[[Durán Madonna]]'', oil on oak wood, ''circa'' 1435–1438. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.]]

The painting is a ''[[Nursing Madonna|Madonna Lactans]]''. The Madonna and Child stand in a space delimited by the rich brocade of the throne at the back and the delicate curtain of tracery in the front, a flattening of the picture space into a kind of relief regarded by Panofsky as already unmistakably Rogerian.&lt;ref name= "description"/&gt; It was a technique he would further refine in his ''[[Durán Madonna]]'' of 1435–1438. In this work, Mary holds the child in her arms as he suckles at her breast. The blue colour of her robe may allude to her devotion and fidelity to her son. She is wearing a crown, positioning her as [[Queen of Heaven]]. The Child is unclothed save for a white linen cloth, foreshadowing the shroud in which his body was later placed following the [[Descent from the Cross|Deposition]].&lt;ref name="b329"&gt;Birkmeyer, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

The niche around the central couple contains a number of biblical figures in grisaille. [[God the Father]] is shown at the centre top, just above the niche's concave [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]. He is depicted in frontal [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortening]], giving the impression that He is emerging from the clouds around Him. He seems to lean forward with one hand raised in blessing and the other resting on the frame, the latter a device likely borrowed from the depiction of the prophet [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] in the right [[lunette]] on the exterior of the Ghent altarpiece. In both depictions the father is shown directly above Mary, looking down at her and resting on the painting's frame.&lt;ref name="b330"&gt;Birkmeyer, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In the current panel, a dove hovers above Mary, symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]].

To Mary's left and right are the figures of Adam and Eve, referencing the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;Acres, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Eve stands underneath an apple tree, with a large serpent with a human head coiling its body around its trunk. She eats from the [[forbidden fruit]], indicating that she is depicted at the moment of the [[fall of man]]. However Roger avoids providing the work with a narrative element by reversing the typical portrayal of the first couple; Adam is to the left, Eve to the right. Unusually for art to this point, they stand apart, divided on either side of the imitation pictorial frame. Again, this is likely borrowed from the Ghent altarpiece, where the couple are separated by five panels.&lt;ref name="b331"&gt;Birkmeyer, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The lions on the armrests of the chair behind Mary show that she is standing in front of a [[Throne of Solomon]], as is also depicted in [[Jan van Eyck | Jan Eyck's]] ''[[Lucca Madonna]]'' recalling the [[Seat of Wisdom]] tradition.&lt;ref name="b329" /&gt;

By portraying the ancillary figures in grisaille, Rogier is making a distinction between the earthly, who are rendered as in flesh, and the divine, depicted frozen in time, as imitation sculpture.&lt;ref name="b331" /&gt;

==Dating==
This painting along with the '' [[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden) |Virgin and Child Enthroned]]'' are generally cited as the earliest known works by van der Weyden.&lt;ref name = "Ward"&gt;Ward, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] suggested he produced them while still in the workshop of [[Robert Campin]]. John Ward of the [[University of Florida]] suggests he executed the ''Madonna Standing'' after leaving Campin's studio to travel to [[Ghent]] where he likely saw [[Jan van Eyck]]'s newly completed ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' which is signed and dated May 6, 1432.&lt;ref name= "description"&gt;Panofsky, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;

Karl Birkmeyer, noting the many borrowing from van Eyck, believes that the panel was completed after Rogier left his apprenticeship. He draws on documentary evidence that the artist did not leave Campin's studio until August 1, 1432, and offers that the technical and compositional skill of the work already indicates the ability and creative freedom of a master craftsman. Birkmeyer goes on to distinguish how the borrowing of motifs are not merely echoes, and that Rogier builds on them and absorbs them into his own expressive language. Many of the motifs he was to return to in more mature works; notably in the heightened abstraction of the ''[[Durán Madonna]]''.&lt;ref name="b331" /&gt;

'''''Mass Effect 2: Overlord''''' is a [[downloadable content]] pack developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the 2010 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and is included in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Mass Effect 2'', which was released in 2011. Set on a remote [[Earth]]-like planet during the 22nd century, ''Overlord'' follows the events of an experimental [[virtual intelligence]] that has gone rogue.

''Overlord'' comprises a new series of missions for the player to complete and encourages planetary exploration aboard a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead. Its vehicle exploration aspect was designed to be similar to that found in the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''. ''Overlord'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its frightening atmosphere and open-ended exploration. Criticism was targeted at the Hammerhead's simplistic combat and unnatural jumping mechanics.

''Mass Effect 2: Overlord'' is a [[downloadable content]] pack for the 2010 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. Set on a remote [[Earth]]-like planet called Aite during the 22nd century, it follows the events of an experimental [[virtual intelligence]] that has gone rogue. The player assumes the role of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is ordered by Dr. Gavin Archer to gain access to the station where the virtual intelligence is kept in [[lockdown]] and shut it down. Shepard succeeds, but learns that Archer had been trying to gain influence over a hostile race of networked [[artificial intelligence]]s by interfacing his autistic brother's mind with the virtual intelligence.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; Shepard is then given the option to either take his brother to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with Archer.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt;

''Overlord'' comprises a series of missions that take place in different facilities on the surface of Aite and that generally involve squad-based combat.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt; It unfolds in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] manner and encourages planetary exploration.&lt;ref name="1UP announcement"/&gt; To go from one mission to another, the player must use a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt; The player can freely explore Aite aboard the vehicle and change squad members before starting a mission.&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; There is [[side-quest]] that requires the player to collect several data packs on the planet.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; The Hammerhead has the ability to jump over obstacles to reach certain areas and is armed with a gun that the player can use to destroy hostile targets over the planet.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt; ''Overlord'' also includes three in-game upgrades, which allow the player to enhance certain aspects of the game's weapons and armor, as well as two [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]].&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt;

==Development and release==
''Overlord'' was developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. During development of ''Mass Effect 2'', Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy.&lt;ref name="IGN interview"/&gt; The pack was announced to be in development on May 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="IGN announcement"/&gt; BioWare executive producer [[Casey Hudson]] stated that ''Overlord'' was the "biggest downloadable content pack yet" and confirmed that they would not introduce more squad members to the game like they did with previous packs.&lt;ref name="Biggest DLC yet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP announcement"/&gt; The developers focused on exploration and vehicle platforming, similar to that found in ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s earlier downloadable content pack ''Firewalker''.&lt;ref name="GS preview"/&gt; Since vehicle exploration was a feature of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'', Hudson called ''Overlord'' "a throwback to how some of the exploration worked in [the first] ''Mass Effect''."&lt;ref name="GS preview"/&gt; The soundtrack was composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]].&lt;ref name="Overlord soundtrack"/&gt; The pack was released on June 15, 2010, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]]. Like ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s other downloadable content packs [[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi – Stolen Memory|''Kasumi – Stolen Memory'']] and [[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|''Lair of the Shadow Broker'']], ''Overlord'' is freely included in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of the game, which was released on January 18, 2011.&lt;ref name="IGN version differences"/&gt;

''Overlord'' received positive reviews from critics. Reviewer Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] described it as "one of the best series of missions that the franchise has yet seen."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Similarly, reviewer Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] opined that the pack "never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long, leavening the expected [[Cover system|duck-and-cover]] combat with openworld exploration and a dash of environmental puzzling, all wrapped up in a story that builds to a satisfying and pathos-heavy finale."&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that "a few of the larger environments let you take on [enemies] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s battles."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; He also praised the final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battle, which he felt exceeded that of the main game.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

Critics generally praised the vehicular sections of the mission. Eurogamer felt that the Hammerhead "responds well to the terrain, with just the right mix of weight and bounciness."&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; IGN considered it an improvement over the Mako carrier featured in the original ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Brad Gallaway of GameCritics, who gave the main game a mixed review, was satisfied with its inclusion and felt that BioWare "managed to incorporate all of the various aspects of ''Mass Effect'' together in a way [he] felt was largely lacking in the core adventure and the previous add-ons."&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]'s Eduardo Reboucas stated similar pros, but admitted that jumping on platforms with the Hammerhead goes against the nature of the game.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt; Likewise, VanOrd felt that the Hammerhead goes underutilized due to its exclusive use in the pack.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Some reviewers also criticized the simplistic vehicular combat, comparing it unfavorably with that of the original ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

VanOrd gave high marks to the pack's frightening atmosphere, stating that "haunting new music instills a palpable sense of tension, and the dark interior spaces provide a sinister contrast to the shimmering waterfalls and scorching lava rivers on the planet's surface."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; The IGN review observed that the visuals and audio surpass many side quests of the main game.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Critics also highlighted very positively the story.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; Eurogamer opined that the ending was effective and unexpected,&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; while VanOrd remarked that the ending cutscene "features some uncomfortable images that will linger in your mind even after you've returned to the [main game]."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Despite evaluating the pack's short length, VanOrd concluded that ''Overlord'' "is one downloadable delight ''Mass Effect 2'' fans shouldn't miss."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

[[Image:Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek - Melpomene.jpg|thumb|Roman statue of Melpomene, 2nd century AD. The muse is shown in a long-sleeved garment with a high belt, clothing that was associated with tragic actors. Her wreath of vines and grapes alludes to [[Dionysus]], the god of the theatre.]]
[[File:Melpomene (by Joseph Fagnani).jpg|thumb|''Melpomene'' by [[Joseph Fagnani]] (1819–1873) (1869)]]

'''Melpomene''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|l|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|ᵻ|n|iː}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Μελπομένη#Ancient Greek|Μελπομένη]]|Melpoménē|to sing' or 'the one that is melodious}}), initially the [[Muse]] of Chorus, she then became the '''Muse of Tragedy''', for which she is best known now.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Blyth |first=Charles |title=Virgilian Tragedy and [[Troilus]] |publisher= [[The Chaucer Review]] |date=1990 |volume=24 |number=3 |pages=211-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the [[cothurnus]], boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other.

Melpomene is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Mnemosyne]]. Her sisters include [[Calliope]] (muse of epic poetry), [[Clio]] (muse of history), [[Euterpe]] (muse of lyrical poetry), [[Terpsichore]] (muse of dancing), [[Erato]] (muse of erotic poetry), [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] (muse of comedy), [[Polyhymnia]] (muse of hymns), and [[Urania]] (muse of astronomy).  She is also the mother of several of the [[Siren (mythology)#List of Sirens|Sirens]], the divine handmaidens of [[Persephone|Kore (Persephone/Proserpina)]] who were cursed by her mother, [[Demeter]]/[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], when they were unable to prevent the kidnapping of Kore (Persephone/[[Proserpina]]) by [[Hades]]/[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].  

In Roman and Greek poetry, it was traditional{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} to invoke the goddess Melpomene so that one might create beautiful lyrical phrases (see [[Horace's Odes]]).

This article is about the modern architecture and town-planning of [[Uzbekistan]], a country in [[Central Asia]]. Formation and development of Modern architecture and town-planning of Uzbekistan historically shares for three periods:

==The First Period==

The first period – second half of 19th century – 1920s when a part of possession of [[Bukhara]] and all the lands of Kokand khanates were won by the Russian empire.

At the period ''traditional architecture'' and town planning developed in parallel with the ''Russian-European'' architecture.
Russian engineers and architects projected and built new cities, such as ''Skobelev'' (Fergana), Kagan, and new quarters in ''Tashkent'', ''Samarqand'', ''Andizhan''.

There were two-structural cities, ''Old'' and ''New'' cities&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/14778743/Modern_architecture_of_Uzbekistan Modern architecture in Uzbekistan is well-devepoled]&lt;/ref&gt; which were opposite on a development level. The old city represented a typical [[Central Asia]]n city with one-storied irregular buildings, with a labyrinth of streets, and the New city was built up by one-two-storied houses and had a regular planning, straight, planted and paved streets, sidewalks, arch network, etc.
There were new types of buildings, such as: banks, cinemas, railway stations, hospital and office building, etc., which ''architecture'' was planned in several style directions, beginning from eclecticism and gothic style up to modernism. Modernist style forms were widely applied basically in element variant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagetour.org/wp/architecture-in-uzbekistan-past-and-present/ Details about the past and present time of architecture of Uzbekistan]&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of local traditional forms of monumental architecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture2.htm The information on monumental architecture in Uzbekistan]&lt;/ref&gt; for buildings of new purposes (a cinema “[[Khiva]]”) is characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture2.htm Architectural works in Tashkent in current time]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second Period==

The second period – the mid 1930s – 1991 formation of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] – is searching and the statement of new socialist culture under rigid dictatorship of bolshevist-communistic ideology.

In architecture of public buildings one observes three stylistic directions: 
# constructivist
#: Examples: the House of government in Tashkent (1930), the State Bank in Andizhan (1928)
# imitation of classical samples
#: Examples: Office building on Pushkin street at Amir Temur square (1937)
# use of motifs of the Uzbek national architecture
#: Examples: “Vatan” cinema (1938), Uzbekistan pavilion at agricultural exhibition in Moscow (1939)

Creation of some state project institutes, the [[Tashkent]]  city architectural-planning department, ''Union of architects'' (1935) which united the republic creative power, and also opening of architectural branch (1929), later – faculty at technical colleges and nowadays at ''Tashkent Architectural Building Institute'' (which is most modern) was remarkable tendency at the time.

==The Third Period==

In 1941-1945 there were plenty of new problems: sharp growth of population, transfer of the industrial enterprises with the ''local personnel, shortage of buildings'',  materials especially ''wood'' and ''ferroconcrete'' materials. Despite severe conditions, the creative activity was proceeded (e.g. ''Mukimi'' theater, a three-story house on the bank of Anhor channel in [[Tashkent]] city, as well as new settlements in ''Chirchik'', ''Bekabad'' and others).

In post-war years a big updating is brought in the general layout of [[Samarqand]], [[Fergana]], [[Bukhara]], [[Kokand]], [[Khiva]], etc. taking into account new principles of planning, industrial methods of mass building, buildings of scientifically-methodical recommendations, unfortunately, it was insufficiently considered specific features of a southern city with its unique structure and environment. Principles of the European town-planning with huge open spaces, powerful transport arteries, many-storey apartment houses etc., aren’t always combined with traditional town-planning&lt;ref&gt;Traditional town-planning is taken from "Moziydan Sado" magazine,2003&lt;/ref&gt; culture – with necessity of shaded, half-opened spaces, scale internal inhabited environment and expedient neighborhood center.
Creative use of folk art methods, courageous processing of the classical order forms and other progressive receptions in building of the State academic [[Opera]] and ''Ballet'' Theater in Tashkent&lt;ref&gt;The information about history of Tashkent is written in "Toshkentnoma", Maqsud Shayhzoda&lt;/ref&gt;(constructed by A.Shchusev, 1947) rendered a great influence on a creative orientation of public building architecture in [[Uzbekistan]].

'''''Morning Patrol''''' ({{lang-el|Πρωϊνή Περίπολος|translit=Proini Peripolos|italic=yes}}) is a 1987 Greek drama film directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. It introduced a new iconography to Nikolaidis' work and contains several elements somewhat resembling the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller genre]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karalis, Vrasidas|title=A History of Greek Cinema|publisher=New York, New York: [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=2012|page=223|isbn=1441112782|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBFEq35eK-EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+greek+cinema&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia2cSJrIfLAhWDBywKHdTyCEYQ6AEIGjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nikolaidis%20thriller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has an elaborate yet simple script of strongly contrasting moods. The film's dialogue contains excerpts taken from published works authored by [[Daphne du Maurier]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Raymond Chandler]], and [[Herman Raucher]]. It received the Best Director Award and the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award at the [[Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema]] in October [[1987 in film|1987]], where [[Dinos Katsouridis]] also won the Best Cinematographer Award and Marie-Louise Bartholomew also won the Best Art Director Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;page=971&amp;year=1987|script-title=el:Γενικά 1987: Βραβεία Ελληνικός κινηματογράφος|website=[[Thessaloniki International Film Festival|Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης (Πληροφορίες: Βραβεία)]]|accessdate=5 September 2014|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on further to be officially selected for screening at [[Fantasporto]] in February [[1989 in film|1989]] where it was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award and it was also officially selected for screening at the [[Avoriaz#Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival|Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival]] in January [[1987 in film|1987]] where it was nominated for the Grand Prize.

==Plot==
A lonely and perplexed woman, played by future Nikolaidis mainstay Michele Valley, wanders through the ruins of a destroyed and deserted city in a post-apocalyptic era. She wonders whatever happened and where did all the residents disappear to. She does not remember much about herself, including even her own name, where is she supposed to be going, and whether she ever had any relatives.

Her searches throughout the city are not successful and no one can help her. Memories of the past come in the form of dreams and bestow upon her guidance and hope; all alone, in a mysterious and abandoned place, she finds the travel difficult. The windows and doors of the city's buildings are all open and the city is almost entirely silent, a silence violated only by the sounds coming out of a [[Movie theater|film theater]] in which the protagonist finds herself at one instance.

However, the reigning silence is only an appearance, for at times the city comes alive and becomes a dangerous place. Carelessness and gullibility can cost lives. The woman finally meets a lonely man in despair, employed as a guard, eventually finding with him the ultimate link between love and death (a theme which Nikolaidis explored in his later films).

It will receive £20million Government grant in aid between 2011–15, allowing for an annual budget of £4m-5m.

A diverse list of over 1,200 heritage items have been safeguarded by the National Heritage Memorial Fund to the tune of nearly £300 million, including:

*The [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] (£4.5M to the [[British Library]], 2012)
*The [[Mappa Mundi]]
*The [[Mary Rose]] 
*[[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]]
*The last surviving [[World War II]] [[destroyer]], [[HMS Cavalier]], 
*[[Orford Ness]] nature reserve in [[Suffolk]]
*[[Beamish Museum|Beamish Exhibition Colliery]]
*[[Sir Walter Scott]] manuscripts 
*[[Antonio Canova]]'s "[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]" 
*[[Picasso]]'s "Weeping Woman" 
*The [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]], a miniature by [[Jean Bourdichon]] 
*[[Thrust2]] world land speed record car

'''Norsk folkeminnelag''' (NFL) [= Norwegian Folklore Society] founded in 1920, is a voluntary, non-profit cultural organization communicating and disseminating traditional folk poetry and customs. The society both protects collected materials through book releases, does guidance for collectors and own research in the field of folklore. From 1922 to 2012, the company has published 166 book titles, as well as a reprint of [[Magnus Brostrup Landstad]]s ''Norske Folkeviser'' (= Norwegian Folk Songs) from 1852, besides cassettes and CDs with original recorded Folk Songs.

Main activities are the publication of the book series ''Norsk Folkeminnelags skrifter'' [= writings]. In addition, the Norwegian Folklore Society publishes a journal called ''FOLKEMINNER. NFL-Nytt'' [= News], with scientific papers and articles on various folkloric topics, as well as book reviews. The journal also contains communication from board meetings, seminars, etc.
[[File:Norsk Folkeminnelag 1920.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The newspaper ''Tidens Tegn'''s presentation of the newly established Folk Society in, 1920, with a drawing of its founder, professor [[Knut Liestøl]].]]

==Decentralization of oral sources==
From the beginning, the Folklore Society has committed itself to publish to a wide audience. Since the 1830s oral stories have been collected among Norwegian peasants, sailors and students. The most important of these sources (collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], [[Sophus Bugge]], [[Moltke Moe]], etc.), led to the creation of Norsk Folkeminnesamling (NFS). By 1914, these materials had become entered the public domain. Nevertheless, archives were essentially inaccessible to ordinary people. The same applied to other collections (i.e. Johan Theodor Storaker etc.), which were taken care of at the Manuscript Collection in the [[University Library of Oslo]] (now the [[National Library of Norway]], Oslo).

NFL in particular emphasized folklore genres, beliefs and customs that were linearly passed on from one generation to the next.
While the early editions were systematically parent material collections the books in recent years have been more focused on historical context and commentary, with book decor, illustrations, hard back and bindings. Earlier the Norwegian Folklore Society was most focused on making available the already collected material at NFS. This was done to refute allegations that the reconstruction of such a central archive would only cause the material exclusively reserved for a small circle of scholars. It was an explicit national program to make sure the oral sources in published form should be returned to the areas where they were originally collected. At the same time the releases were meant to be a tribute to the collectors, and a way to encourage them to continue their efforts to save important oral culture that surrounded them in everyday life.

==The purpose of the Folklore Society's business==
However, NFL highlights not only what stands in danger of being buried and forgotten, but is also involved in ongoing collection and mapping of contemporary folk culture. Through folkloristic releases from virtually every corner of Norway the Folklore Society has succeeded in preserving and visualizing a great part of the country's intangible cultural heritage, which could otherwise be lost to time. Perspectives have also shifted towards identifying new cultural elements, cultural encounters (acculturation), and different forms of expression.

As the oral tales are being transferred to other media, some may argue that the material is not being done justice until the material once again comes to be used in its traditional environment. However, the releases are not primarily intended to ''revitalize'', but rather to ''document'' different traditions. Furthermore, in some cases, tapes and CD-releases are attached to books with musical content. Through releases the Folklore Society conducts an active cultural policy by making the readers aware of aspects of the intangible material culture that most people might not otherwise have gained awareness of. There are also many examples of local communities, professional musicians and storytellers that have been able to acquire and revitalize parts of their historical local culture after the documented sources from the Folklore Society.

==The Folklore Society's current and future work==
NFL volatile workspaces - the intangible immaterial culture - has put its main focus on book publications. This has been and is still the backbone of the activities, but NFL also operates other types of cultural dissemination. The Society is actively participating in projects through the guidance of those who are willing to collect folk tradition, and also consultation authors with scripts. NFL has on several occasions been involved in exhibitions and cultural arrangements, and cooperate extensively with other cultural organizations, and do lectures, seminars on their own. NFL is also a member of the Norwegian Cultural Heritage Association.

An '''Objects conservator''' is a professional, working in a [[museum]] setting or private practice, that specializes in the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of three-dimensional works.  They undergo specialized education, training, and experience that allows them to formulate and implement preventative strategies and invasive treatment protocols to preserve cultural property for the future.&lt;ref name="AIC Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of Conservation Terminology|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/definitions#.Uwy7NvldV8E/|work=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objects conservators typically specialize in one type of material or class of cultural property, including metals, [[archaeological artifacts]], [[ethnographic]] artifacts, glass, and [[ceramic art]].  Objects conservation presents many challenges due to their three-dimensional form and composite nature.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The diverse nature of artifacts that fall into the category of three dimensional objects presents a unique challenge to compiling a set of common procedures.  However, preventative measures and treatment methodologies involve similar considerations that need to be addressed, regardless of the object's composition.  In the words of Cesare Brandi, "Restoration must aim to reestablish the potential unity of the work of art, as long as this is possible without producing an artistic or historical forgery and without erasing every trace of the passage of time left on the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage|date=1996|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-892363-98-8|editor=Price, N. |editor2=Talley Jr. M. K. |editor3=Vaccaro, A. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  This means that an Objects Conservator needs to know when to draw the line, and communicate that limit to the object's custodian.

===Preventative Measures===
[[File:IMA Objects conservator 3.jpg|thumb|left|Mallory Marty prepares an object to be moved  at the Indianapolis Museum of Art to prevent damage while in transit.]]
While not as glamorous or hands-on as the other steps in this process, collections care, or [[Preventive conservation|preventative conservation]], is arguably the most important.  To truly preserve cultural heritage for the future, it is imperative to minimize deterioration by developing and implementing procedures to minimize the amount of physical and chemical stress an object encounters.  This includes its environmental conditions (relative humidity, temperature, exposure to light), [[integrated pest management]] protocols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest MAnagement|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management|work=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of specialized storage containers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing a Collection of Artifacts Representing American Cultural Traditions|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/legacies/3D.html|work=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for packing and shipping, exhibition conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental and Display Guidelines for Paintings and Polychrome Sculptures|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/10-4-eng.aspx|work=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Emergency response (museum)|emergency preparedness plan]].  The initial expense of such measures often causes institutions and private collectors to balk, but in comparison to the expense of the invasive treatments that will be needed if one does not take such preventative measures, the benefit outweighs the initial investment.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|edition=5|editor=Buck, R. |editor2=Gilmore, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventative conservation is also something that a private collector can implement for their own pieces.  Controlling the amount of light an object is exposed to, the source of illumination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Lighting Research Lighting Case Studies|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lighting/case.html|work=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ambient temperature of its environment, and protecting it from rapid changes in relative humidity goes a long way towards ensuring that an object will be around to pass down to future generations.

===Treatment Protocol===

While each object is unique, conservators begin with a similar process regardless of the artifact being assessed.   A Conservator may need to stabilize an object at any stage in the process to prevent further loss, or, in extreme cases, begin by stabilizing an object before further examination can occur.  Documentation takes place during every step of treatment, including: original condition, sample sites (if taken), different types of damage, areas of significant weakness before and after stabilization, and potential infestation sites.  It is also important to document the objects condition before and after moving it, especially in the case of off-site transport.  The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve both the physical object and its interpretation, or cultural context.&lt;ref name="Barbara Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=San Bernardino, CA|isbn=978-1-453682-11-1|author=Barbara Appelbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examination====
The first step of any treatment protocol is a thorough examination of the object.  This includes both its physical components and its cultural importance.  Physical components include the materials used, its construction, and the appearance of the object's surface.  The conservator often employs different techniques for this portion of the examination, including photographs taken in different light conditions such as visible, raking, and Ultraviolet to examine the surface, and x-rays to reveal the structure within.  Cultural significance is more challenging to determine, including the object's meaning, function, intended use, and importance to society.

Thorough examination and research allows the Conservator to reconstruct an object's history and, together with the object's custodian (the owner, a [[curator]], [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]], or [[collection manager]]) determine the object's ideal state and determine a realistic treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Barbara Appelbaum"/&gt;
[[File:IMA Objects conservator 1.jpg|thumb|Laura Kubick treats an object at the Indianapolis Museum of Art]]

====Treatment====
Following examination the Conservator will prepare a pre-treatment report that discusses the treatment goal for the object and the planned course of action.  As defined by AIC, treatment is "The deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence.&lt;ref name="AIC Definitions"/&gt;" This can be something as minimal as reinforcing flaking paint, or something as complex as the migration of metals and salts through a wooden statue, leading to loss of strength, shrinkage, separation between the wooden support, metal fastenings, and decorative outer surface.

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
Objects Conservators must be an expert collaborator, working with members of the public and museum professionals alike. Conservation is not a vacuum and practitioners collaborate with colleagues around the world, lending expertise and receiving guidance.  They need to advocate for the object, explain their treatment protocol, the importance of preventative measures, and stand firm when asked to reconsider a "no". They must also be open to alternate interpretations, have an understanding of different materials and construction techniques,keen observation skills, and deft hands.

==Education &amp; training==

Most museums and prestigious private firms require graduate degrees in Conservation.  Without graduate level education, knowledge of chemistry, hands-on experience, and a thorough foundation in documentation, evaluation, and treatment an institution or firm is taking a serious risk.  Anyone can call themselves a conservator, but it is the specialized training gained through graduate programs or similar experiences that count.

Gaining admission to a conservation graduate program includes an undergraduate degree, a concentration in chemistry (specifically organic chemistry), and a significant number of hours working under a trained Conservator.  This ensures that the candidate has a through foundation upon which to build and is already familiar with many aspects of the process.

'''Orleigh Court''' is a [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] [[manor house]] in the parish of [[Buckland Brewer]] about 4 miles (6.4 km) south-west of [[Bideford]], North [[Devon]], England. It is a two-storeyed building constructed from local [[slate]] stone and has a [[great hall]] with a [[hammer-beam]] roof, installed in the late 15th century.

The building was substantially altered in the early 18th century and remodelled after 1869. It was redeveloped for multiple occupancy in the 1980s and is now divided into about twelve apartments. It was the birthplace of the famous explorer and discoverer of the source of the [[River Nile]], [[John Hanning Speke]] (1827–1864).

==History==
{{Further|Manor of Orleigh}}

===Early===
The earliest parts of the building to survive were built by a member of the [[Denys family#Denys of Devon|Denys family]]. The hall, which is 30&amp;nbsp;ft x 20&amp;nbsp;ft and has 5-foot-thick walls, has been dated by the form of decoration around the doorways to the early to mid-14th century.&lt;ref name=E&gt;Emery (2006), pp. 611–12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1416, a licence for a chapel at the house was granted by Bishop Stafford, and it has been speculated that the room over the porch was used for this.&lt;ref name=RDA&gt;Rogers (1926), pp. 185–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 15th century the hall was remodelled and it is clear that some of the work was based on that already done at nearby [[Weare Giffard]] Hall; identical carving on the porches of both buildings shows that the same mason was employed for at least part of the work. The main improvement, though, was the construction of a fine four-bay [[hammerbeam roof]] to the main hall, again clearly influenced by, though somewhat less ornate than the one at Weare Giffard.&lt;ref name=E /&gt; The hammer-beams are supported on carved stone corbels representing figures, one of which holds a shield displaying the arms of the Denys family (three battleaxes). Sitting on the ends of the hammer-beams were a series of ten carved sitting heraldic beasts, each around two feet tall.&lt;ref name=E /&gt;

A few alterations were made during the late 16th century, such as the addition of a staircase to the left of the porch,&lt;ref name=B /&gt; and the insertion of a large window into the hall to the right of the porch.&lt;ref name=P&gt;Cherry &amp; Pevsner (1989), pp. 613–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The last male member of the Denys family of Orleigh was Anthony Dennis (died 1641), to whom a mural monument survives in the Orleigh Chapel in St Mary's Church, Buckland Brewer.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Mural monument to Anthony Dennis (d.1641), his second wife, and his eleven children in Buckland Brewer church.&lt;/ref&gt; When he died in 1641 he left three daughters as co-heiresses and they conveyed the property to trustees in 1661.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In 1684 the trustees sold it to [[John Davie|John I Davie]] (died 1710), a prominent tobacco merchant from Bideford.

===Davie family===
{{Quote box|width=25%|...the chief Mansion of Mr Davie, who having a predilection for Watermouth has intentions either of letting or disposing of this place.|—[[John Swete|Rev. John Swete]] who passed by near Orleigh in 1797 and wrote of it in his journal.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Todd &amp; Rowe, Margery (Eds.) (1999), ''Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of the Reverend John Swete, 1789-1800'', vol.3, Tiverton, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;}}
John I Davie died in 1710 and is commemorated by a large mural monument in the Orleigh Chapel of St Mary's Church, Buckland Brewer.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1938), pp.53–4.)&lt;/ref&gt; his son and heir, Joseph Davie (died 1723), embarked on a series of improvements to the interior. These included, in the hall, the installation of an ornamental fireplace,&lt;ref name=E /&gt; and the addition of fire buckets decorated with the Davie arms and the date 1721 — they remained in place until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=RDA /&gt;&lt;ref name=P /&gt; Other additions made at this time included a new inner hall accessed from newly created doors by the side of the fireplace, and rainwater heads on the east front of the building, which bear the Davie arms as well as those of Pryce, which refer to Joseph Davie's wife, Juliana Pryce, who died aged 28 in 1720. Joseph himself died in 1723, but the building stayed in the Davie family until 1807, when it was in the ownership of Joseph Davie Bassett, who built [[Watermouth Castle]] and moved there. In that year Orleigh Court was either sold, or according to local tradition, lost in a game of cards, to Major Edward Lee.&lt;ref name=RDA /&gt;

===Lee, Speke and Rogers===
After Edward Lee's death in 1819, the house passed to his nephew, the politician [[John Lee Lee]] (1802-1874),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hakewill]] to make extensive changes to the house, including the replacement of most of the windows, including a new [[oriel window]] in the porch, complete reworking of the north range and the addition of a wood-panelled dining room. Hakewill also built two [[Tudor Revival architecture|Mock Tudor]] lodges in the grounds.&lt;ref name=P /&gt; Orleigh was inherited by his son William Henry Rogers (born 1868),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Obituary Notices – William Henry Rogers| journal=Report &amp; Transactions of the Devonshire Association| year=1944| volume=76| page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; who made a few alterations to it, such as replacing some of the dry-rot infested panelling in the hall with 16th-century decorated panels which he had discovered in a loft over the stables, and which he surmised had been removed from the original dining room.&lt;ref name=RDA /&gt;

William Henry Rogers was an [[antiquarian]] and he included a history of Orleigh Court in a booklet about Buckland Brewer, published in 1938.

'''Overlay architecture''', or '''Overlay''', is "event [[architecture]]", such as the temporary elements that are added to more permanent buildings to enable the operation of major [[sporting event]]s or [[festival]]s. These elements provide additional facilities for the duration of an event and are generally of a lightweight construction, as they are often removed afterwards.

==Use==
The role of overlay is extensive and can cover all aspects of a major event, starting with the "back of house" user groups, including staff, operations, officials, [[broadcast]], [[Mass media|media]], hospitality, [[VIP]]s and the athletes themselves. These groups all require physical facilities to provide [[accreditation]], accommodation, segregation and [[wayfinding]], which need to be separated from, but connected to, the spectators at the "front of house", to preserve the magic and mystery of the event experience.
It is important that the overlay design is integrated into the masterplan of major events at an early stage, in order that the flow of people through the site can be effectively managed and sufficient space provided for the various overlay facilities.  
The overlay design also has a significant role in helping to define the overall environment of a major event. By taking a design-inclusive approach and considering the cultural and design aspects alongside the commercial and functional requirements, memorable places and spaces can be created out of simple components and hired commodities.

==Overlay categories==
Overlay can be categorised in three main ways: 

* '''Existing facilities''': the overlay consists of temporary elements being added to an existing space to accommodate the specific needs of an event (e.g. the [[Excel Centre]], or the [[Archery]] range at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]) 
* '''New facilities''': the overlay consists of temporary elements that are integrated with permanent elements in a new facility or venue for an event (e.g. the [[Olympic Stadium]])
* '''Temporary facilities''': the overlay creates a completely temporary facility or venue for an event (e.g. the [[Beach Volleyball]] court at [[Horse Guards Parade]], or the [[Equestrianism|Equestrian]] Centre at [[Greenwich Park]])

'''''Polish Hamlet. Portrait of Alexander Wielopolski'' '''is an oil painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]] from 1903, presenting the allegorical grandson Alexander Wielopolski and two different visions of the fate of the Polish nation. 

== Description ==
It is in the collection of the [[National Museum, Warsaw]].

It was painted in 1903, and is one of the most famous works of Malczewski. It presents the painter's grandson as [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], Polish politician, a member of the Polish Kingdom government in the early 1860s, who tried to maneuver between the interests of the invaders and the Polish population. The figure is located in the center of the composition, surrounded by two women. He is dressed in yellow-green dress and belted pouch, in which instead of bullets are tubes of paint, and he thoughtfully pulls on the petals of chamomile.

==Analysis==
The painting is symbolic and patriotic, it can be read in several ways. The women placed on both sides of the picture are an allegory of two different visions of the fate of their homeland. Located to the right is an elderly woman with white hair, dressed in dark robes, her hands cuffed on shackles, and her face takes on an expression of sadness, despair and awareness of their situation. She embodies Poland enslaved, experienced by fate, remaining under the yoke of others, and who can not be liberated. On the left side there is a young girl, half-naked, shown at the time of breaking the shackles. She is full of energy, and her face has the expression of a very expressive. It symbolizes the "young Poland" - capable of action and being able to release from the long-term captivity.

The image can be interpreted as a question of choosing the right way and the future fate of the homeland, entering a new century. This dilemma clearly refers to the title character of [[Hamlet]], William Shakespeare's drama and his life choice, as highlighted in the title of the work. Alexander Wielopolski is an example of the person making the difficult decision, and carrying the consequences of that choice, resulting from the need to accept or reject the attitude towards life of his grandfather. The artist does not in favor which solution. The figure of a man is pensive, lost in melancholy, and his indecision which highlights even more the flower in his hand and a belt on the body. The work is an expression of his concern for the future of the Polish.

== Mistaken identity ==

In the literature, due to the fact that actually portrayed in the picture grandson and Alexander Wielopolski name was the same as his grandfather, there is often the wrong suggestion that image presented his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Ławniczakowa: Jacek Malczewski.

Ossolińskich, 1983. {{ISBN|83-04-01355-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Jacek Malczewski could not portray his grandfather, because he died in 1877 and the picture was painted in 1903. In addition, the portrayed person does not resemble Alexander Wielopolski.&lt;ref&gt;Dorota Kudelska: Dukt pisma i pędzla. Biografia intelektualna Jacka Malczewskiego. Lublin, 2008, s. 731.

'''Psychedelic art''' is any [[art]] or visual displays inspired by [[psychedelic experiences]] and [[hallucination]]s known to follow the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]]. The word "psychedelic" (coined by British psychologist [[Humphry Osmond]]) means "mind manifesting".  By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered "psychedelic".  In common parlance "psychedelic art" refers above all to the art movement of the late [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].  Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock music]].  Concert posters, album covers, [[liquid light shows]], liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns of LSD hallucinations,  but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.

== Features ==
[[File:Liquid Oil Projection.jpg|thumb|A liquid oil projection]]
* Fantastic, metaphysical and surrealistic subject matter
* [[Kaleidoscope|Kaleidoscopic]], [[fractal art|fractal]] or [[paisley (design)|paisley]] patterns
* Bright and/or highly contrasting colors
* Extreme depth of detail or stylization of detail. Also so called [[Horror vacui]] style.
* Morphing of objects or themes and sometimes [[collage]]
* [[Phosphenes]], spirals, concentric circles, [[diffraction]] patterns, and other [[entoptic phenomenon|entoptic]] motifs
* Repetition of [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]
* Innovative typography and hand-lettering, including warping and transposition of positive and negative spaces

==Origins==
Psychedelic art is informed by the notion that altered states of consciousness produced by psychedelic drugs are a source of artistic inspiration.  The psychedelic art movement is similar to the surrealist movement in that it prescribes a mechanism for obtaining inspiration.  Whereas the mechanism for surrealism is the observance of dreams, a psychedelic artist turns to drug induced hallucinations.  Both movements have strong ties to important developments in science.  Whereas the surrealist was fascinated by Freud's theory of the unconscious, the psychedelic artist has been literally "turned on" by [[Albert Hofmann]]'s discovery of LSD.

The early examples of "psychedelic art" are literary rather than visual, although there are some examples in the [[Surrealist art]] movement, such as [[Remedios Varo]] and [[André Masson]]. It should also be noted that these came from writers involved in the Surrealist movement.  [[Antonin Artaud]] writes of his peyote experience in ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara'' (1937).  [[Henri Michaux]] wrote ''[[Misérable Miracle]]'' (1956), to describe his experiments with [[mescaline]] and also [[hashish]].

[[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (1954) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1956) remain definitive statements on the psychedelic experience.

Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD.  For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research.  Hofmann saw the drug's potential for  poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer [[Ernst Jünger]]'s psychedelic experiments.

Early artistic experimentation with LSD was conducted in a clinical context by Los Angeles–based psychiatrist [[Oscar Janiger]].  Janiger asked a group of 50 different artists to each do a painting from life of a subject of the artist's choosing. They were subsequently asked to do the same painting while under the influence of LSD.  The two paintings were compared by Janiger and also the artist.  The artists almost unanimously reported LSD to be an enhancement to their creativity.

Ultimately it seems that psychedelics would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture.  Beatnik poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] became fascinated by psychedelic drugs as early as the 1950s as evidenced by ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred inebriants in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a "complete disorientation of the senses" (to paraphrase [[Arthur Rimbaud]]).  They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine.  LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.

==In 1960s counterculture==
[[File:San Francisco Oracle Cover Vol.1 No.5, January 1967.jpg|thumb|Cover of the San Francisco Oracle, Volume 1 No.5, January 1967.]]
Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]].  Their psychedelic rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. The "Fillmore Posters" were among the most notable of the time.  Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style.  The style flourished from about 1966 to 1972.  Their work was immediately influential to vinyl record album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally: British artist [[Bridget Riley]] became famous for her op-art paintings of psychedelic patterns creating optical illusions. [[Mati Klarwein]] created psychedelic masterpieces for [[Miles Davis|Miles Davis']] Jazz-Rock fusion albums, and also for [[Carlos Santana]] Latin Rock.  [[Pink Floyd]] worked extensively with London-based designers, [[Hipgnosis]] to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums. Willem de Ridder created cover art for Van Morrison. Los Angeles area artists such as [[John Van Hamersveld]], [[Warren Dayton]] and Art Bevacqua and New York artists [[Peter Max]] and [[Milton Glaser]] all produced posters for concerts or social commentary (such as the anti-war movement) that were highly collected during this time. Life Magazine's cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the [[Summer of Love]] focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the [[hippie]] counterculture community.

Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion  that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music.  This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely "trippy" atmosphere for the audience.  The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]].  "Zap Comix" was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], Victor Moscoso, [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others.  Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness.  [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, "The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]", whose drugged out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

Psychedelic art was also applied to the LSD itself.  LSD began to be put on blotter paper in the early 1970s and this gave rise to a specialized art form of decorating the blotter paper.  Often the blotter paper was decorated with tiny insignia on each perforated square tab, but by the 1990s this had progressed to complete four color designs often involving an entire page of 900 or more tabs.  Mark McCloud is a recognized authority on the history of LSD blotter art.

==In corporate advertising==
By the late 1960s, the commercial potential of psychedelic art had become hard to ignore. General Electric, for instance, promoted clocks with designs by New York artist Peter Max.  A caption explains that each of Max's clocks "transposes time into multi-fantasy colors."&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; In this and many other corporate advertisements of the late 1960s featuring psychedelic themes, the psychedelic product was often kept at arm's length from the corporate image: while advertisements may have reflected the swirls and colors of an LSD trip, the black-and-white company logo maintained a healthy visual distance. Several companies, however, more explicitly associated themselves with psychedelica: CBS, Neiman Marcus, and NBC all featured thoroughly psychedelic advertisements between 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''68/69 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1968. pgs. 45, 75, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Campbell's soup ran a poster promotion that promised to "Turn your wall souper-delic!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 798&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The art of peter max.jpg|thumb|The Art Of Peter Max]]

The early years of the 1970s saw advertisers using psychedelic art to sell a limitless array of consumer goods. Hair products, cars, cigarettes, and even pantyhose became colorful acts of pseudo-rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pgs. 443, 102, 76, 85, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chelsea National Bank commissioned a psychedelic landscape by Peter Max, and neon green, pink, and blue monkeys inhabited advertisements for a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pgs. 39, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A fantasy land of colorful, swirling, psychedelic bubbles provided the perfect backdrop for a Clearasil ad.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Brian Wells explains, "The psychedelic movement has, through the work of artists, designers, and writers, achieved an astonishing degree of cultural diffusion… but, though a great deal of diffusion has taken place, so, too, has a great deal of dilution and distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Even the term "psychedelic" itself underwent a semantic shift, and soon came to mean "anything in youth culture which is colorful, or unusual, or fashionable."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pgs. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Puns using the concept of "tripping" abounded: as an advertisement for London Britches declared, their product was "great on trips!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All-American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the psychedelic art movement had been largely co-opted by mainstream commercial forces, incorporated into the very system of capitalism that the hippies had struggled so hard to change.

[[Computer art]] has allowed for an even greater and more profuse expression of psychedelic vision.  [[Fractal]] generating software gives an accurate depiction of psychedelic hallucinatory patterns, but even more importantly 2D and 3D graphics software allow for unparalleled freedom of image manipulation.  Much of the graphics software seems to permit a direct translation of the psychedelic vision. The "digital revolution" was indeed heralded early on as the "New LSD" by none other than [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name="Leary, Horowitz &amp; Marshall 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Timothy Leary|Leary, Timothy]]; Horowitz, Michael; Marshall, Vicky| title = Chaos and Cyber Culture| publisher = Ronin Publishing| year = 1994| isbn = 0-914171-77-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthofer 1997"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Ruthofer, Arno|title = Think for Yourself; Question Authority|    year = 1997 |   url = http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html  | accessdate=2007-02-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225454/http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Deep Dream Toast Sandwich.jpg|thumb|350px|[[DeepDream]] modified toast sandwich]]
The rave movement of the 1990s was a psychedelic renaissance fueled by the advent of newly available digital technologies.  The rave movement developed a new graphic art style partially influenced by 1960s psychedelic [[poster art]], but also strongly influenced by graffiti art, and by 1970s advertising art, yet clearly defined by what [[digital art]] and [[computer graphics]] software and home computers had to offer at the time of creation. Conversely, the [[convolutional neural network]] [[DeepDream]] finds and enhance patterns in images purely via algorithmic [[pareidolia]].

Concurrent to the rave movement, and in key respects integral to it, are the development of new mind-altering drugs, most notably, [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy).  Ecstasy, like LSD, has had a tangible influence on culture and [[aesthetics]], particularly the aesthetics of [[Rave|rave culture]].  But MDMA is (arguably) not a real psychedelic, but is described by psychologists as an [[entactogen]].  Development of new psychedelics such as [[2C-B]] and related compounds (developed primarily by chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]]) are truly psychedelic, and these novel psychedelics are fertile ground for artistic exploration since many of the new psychedelics possess their own unique properties that will affect the artist's vision accordingly.

Even as fashions have changed, and art and culture movements have come and gone, certain artists have steadfastly devoted themselves to psychedelia.  Well-known examples are [[Amanda Sage]], [[Alex Grey]], and [[Robert Venosa]].  These artists have developed unique and distinct styles that while containing elements that are "psychedelic", are clearly artistic expressions that transcend simple categorization.  While it is not necessary to use psychedelics to arrive at such a stage of artistic development, serious psychedelic artists are demonstrating that there is tangible technique to obtaining visions, and that technique is the creative use of psychedelic drugs.

'''Psycho-biddy''' is a colloquial term for a subgenre of the [[horror film|horror]]/[[thriller film|thriller movie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://flavorwire.com/335871/the-scariest-psycho-biddies-in-cinema] ''Nastasi, Alison. "The Scariest Psycho Biddies in Cinema." Flavorwire. Oct. 9, 2012.''&lt;/ref&gt; that features a formerly-glamorous older woman who has become mentally unbalanced and terrorizes those around her. The genre officially began in 1962 with the film ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (though it had some antecedents) and lasted through the mid-1970s. It has also been referred to by the terms '''Grande Dame Guignol''', '''hagsploitation''' and '''hag horror'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelley |first=Peter |date=September 15, 2009 |title=Grande Dame Guignol Cinema: A History of Hag Horror from "Baby Jane" to "Mother" |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Grande_Dame_Guignol_Cinema.html?id=HKYqAQAAIAAJ |location=Jefferson, North Carolina and London |publisher=McFarland and Company, Inc. |page= |isbn=978-0786445691 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renata Adler]], in her ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review for the 1968 film ''[[The Anniversary (1968 film)|The Anniversary]]'', referred to the genre as "the Terrifying Older Actress Filicidal Mummy genre."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E0DE1131E034BC4951DFB5668383679EDE ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition, themes and influences==
The subgenre features a mentally unstable, dangerous, or insane woman of advanced years with a somewhat glamorous past, living a life of relative wealth. In some cases, the woman may be in jeopardy of some sort, with another party attempting to drive her to mental instability. Often (but not always), there are two older women pitted against one another in a life-or-death struggle, usually the result of bitter hatreds, jealousies, or rivalries that have percolated over the course of, not years, but decades. These combatants are often blood-relatives. The character is often brought to life in an over-the-top, grotesque fashion, emphasizing the unglamorous process of aging and eventual death. Characters are often seen pining for lost youth and glory, trapped by their idealized memories of their childhood, or younger days, and the trauma of a past episode that haunts them.

This subgenre includes elements of many other genres, including [[gothic fiction|gothic]], [[Grand Guignol]], [[black comedy]], [[psychodrama]], [[melodrama]], [[revenge]], [[camp (style)|camp]] and even the [[musical film|musical]]. [[Science fiction]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] films have also been part of the genre.

==History==
{{Section OR|date=December 2010}}
The genre began in [[1962 in film|1962]] with ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' directed by [[Robert Aldrich]]. ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' bolstered the flagging careers of its [[movie star|stars]], [[Bette Davis]] as [[Baby Jane Hudson]] and [[Joan Crawford]] as [[Blanche Hudson]]. The [[1950 in film|1950]] [[Billy Wilder]] classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' shares thematic similarities (their respective central characters both psychotically deranged formerly-glamorous older women) with ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' and can be seen as a precursor to the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Peter (2009) ''Grande Dame Guignol Cinema'' McFarland and Company, Inc. Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina and London&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baby Jane'' set many trends and more-or-less defined the genre: the theatrical performance, the trappings of wealth and Hollywood, and psychologically complex melodrama. Jane goes quite insane over the course of the movie, torturing her crippled sister and venting long-pent up hostilities and guilt. At the end of the film, Blanche makes a confession which details and admits of her own complicity in the whole affair. The film was quite successful, garnering [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including one for Davis.

Crawford then starred in director and producer [[William Castle]]'s ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]) as Lucy Harbin, the accused axe-murderer of her husband and his mistress, who is released from the [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] for the [[criminally insane]] after 20 years to be reunited with her beloved daughter and other friends. When a new string of axe-murders begins, it is naturally assumed that it is Lucy committing them.

The two actresses were reunited again with director Robert Aldrich for a ''Baby Jane'' "follow-up", ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964), despite a hyped, somewhat exaggerated feud. But genuine mutual dislike between the two actresses led to Crawford bowing out. She was replaced by [[Olivia de Havilland]], who knew how to get along with Davis. Veteran actresses [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Mary Astor]] also appeared in the film.

In ''Charlotte'', Davis was not only the one going insane, but was the "officially" sympathetic character, who is [[gaslighting|gaslit]] by her cousin (De Havilland) and her doctor, the cousin's lover ([[Joseph Cotten]]). In this movie, Davis' character is again haunted by guilt, though this time the ante is upped: instead of believing herself responsible for a crippling, she believes she is responsible for the murder of her lover. ''Charlotte'' is one of the most successful examples of the genre, and is noted for using [[Southern Gothic]] atmosphere.

[[Mad Magazine|''Mad'' Magazine]] poked fun at the genre in 1966 with a movie musical satire entitled "Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been-or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?"&lt;ref&gt;''"Hack, Hack Sweet Has-Been -or Whatever Happened to Good Taste?"'' Written by Mort Drucker, Illustrated by Larry Siegel. ''MAD'' Magazine, Issue No. 100, January 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable films==
[[File:What's the Matter With Helen Shelley Winters 1971.jpg|thumb|Shelley Winters in ''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]'' (1971)]]
Wealth is a more prominent theme than revenge in ''[[What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]). Claire Marrable ([[Geraldine Page]]), a socialite, finds herself (apparently) penniless when her husband dies. She then begins hiring financially independent older cleaning women, murdering them, taking their savings and planting the corpses in her garden. The corpses apparently make the ground quite fertile, and it's not until the third cleaning woman drops out of sight that someone ([[Ruth Gordon]]) begins to suspect something is amiss. Gordon applies to be Page's maid to figure out what happened to her friend, the third maid. The movie has a certain status as a [[cult film|cult classic]], and is fairly well-regarded.

''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) features two older women, Helen Hill ([[Shelley Winters]]) and Adelle Bruckner ([[Debbie Reynolds]]), who move out to Hollywood during the heyday of [[Shirley Temple]]. Their sons have gone to prison for a [[Leopold and Loeb]]-like murder and the two mothers are on the run from a man who threatens to kill them for revenge. Helen, an increasingly unstable and violent religious [[religious fanaticism|fanatic]] and repressed [[Lesbianism|lesbian]], may have murdered her husband years before (and possibly led to her son's criminal behavior). Helen's increasing obsession with Adelle, her roommate, leads to a graphically violent climax, which would recur in future excursions into the genre.

''[[Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?]]'' (1971) has only one older woman, Mrs. Rosie Forrest, a.k.a. Auntie Roo (Shelley Winters), featured prominently in the cast. A young orphan becomes a surrogate in the troubled woman's mind for her own long-dead daughter. Roo visits the mummified remains in her daughter's bedroom. The themes of deep-seated past guilt and youth are explored. The story is a variant of the [[Hansel and Gretel]] theme; however, unlike the witch in the story, Roo is seriously unstable, as well as subject to con-artist clairvoyants and blackmailing servants. She tries to keep the young orphan girl with her, as the girl reminds her of her daughter, but the girl and her brother fight back, and are quite cunning, having stolen, by the film's end, the woman's valuable jewelry. Roo dies in a fire the children set while trying to escape.

Other examples of the genre are the 1965 UK films ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]] in the lead role as the said nanny, and ''[[Fanatic (film)|Fanatic]]'' with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], released in the US as ''Die! Die! My Darling''.

Later films like ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981) and ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' (2000) also contain elements of the psycho-biddy genre in their respective portrayals of aged women who descend into mental instability.

'''''Santa Cecilia''''' is an early painting by the baroque painter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], a painter described as "a grand exception in the history of art - a successful woman painter in an era in which art was dominated by men." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artemisia Gentileschi: The Language of Painting|last=Locker|first=Jesse M.|date=2015|isbn=9780300185119|ref=none|pages=1|place=New Haven, Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canvas was painted around 1620. It shows the saint playing a lute, with an organ, a customary attribute for her, in the background. It currently now in the [[Galleria Spada]] in [[Rome]]; it has been part of the Spada collection since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Orazio_and_Artemisia_Gentileschi|title=Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi|last=Christiansen|first=Keith|last2=Mann|first2=Judith Walker|last5=Museo di Palazzo Venezia (Rome|first5=Italy)|last6=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|first6=N.Y.)|last7=St. Louis Art Museum|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art ; Yale University Press|pages=350|isbn=1588390063|location=New York; New Haven|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Pedro Art Association''', established in 1936, is an art association set within the Los Angeles Harbor community of California. It has a history of established and well known artists dating back to its inception. Through exhibitions and public lectures, it encouraged works beyond representational art, and included figurative and abstract expressionist paintings in the 1950s. Though it originally exhibited primarily watercolor and oil paintings, the association evolved to include various other mediums and art forms.

== History ==
The San Pedro Art Association (SPAA) was established in 1936 in [[San Pedro, California]].  The original members' goals focused on expanding art in San Pedro and its surrounding communities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Association Beginnings|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=2 September 1948|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association was formed by local artists in the community and it held seasonal art shows and exhibitions that were juried by established professionals and awarded artists in both [[oil painting]] and [[watercolor]] mediums.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Gallery Opens Today|newspaper=Independent Press Telegram, Long Beach, CA|date=22 March 1953|page=B-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|title=250 Attend New Art Gallery Opening in Plaza Park Building|newspaper=San Pedro News Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=23 March 1952|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|title=Permanent Art Gallery|newspaper=San Pedro News Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=March 25, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPAA has historically sponsored cultural art exchanges with artists outside the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pan American Exchange Exhibitionto be Shown|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=Aug 10, 1949|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Exhibit of Foreign Art at San Pedro Slated Tomorrow|newspaper=Long Beach Press Telegram, Long Beach, CA|date=Aug 11, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazilian Painting at SP Art Show|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=Nov 6, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; this tradition continues through current exhibitions.  Since then, the association has expanded and is known for bringing local artists together with varied art forms that include painting, photography, sculpture, ceramics, woodworking and jewelry making.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|title=San Pedro: A Different Kind of Burgeoning Art Scene|newspaper=LA Weekly, Los Angeles, CA|date=Jan 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions continue to be presented seasonally and are open to the public.

In 1953, under the direction of its President [[Jay Meuser]], the San Pedro Art Association wrote many of its bylaws and became a non-profit corporation providing a structure for the future growth of its membership and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City of Los Angeles|newspaper=Resolution for the San Pedro Art Association on the Occasion of its 75th Anniversary|date=Sep 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the significant stated goals that continue to be utilized and implemented are:
* To further the mutual inspiration and development of its members by seeking to stimulate their interest in this organization and to encourage them in their own particular line of work.
* To promote means and opportunities for the education of the public with respect to art activities within the community.
* To enlarge and intensify the interest of its members in the artistic, cultural, and educational affairs of the community for its betterment by contributing to and encouraging art activities within the community.
These established goals of enriching the community through art were significant and continue today as an important function of the foundation for the organization and its membership.

The '''Shiv leni Caves''' (Shiva leni; Jogai Mandap; Hattikhana) in [[Ambajogai]], [[Maharashtra]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] are  [[rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92037/_http___www_bl_uk_onlinegallery_onlineex_apac_photocoll_g_zoomify62930_html.html|title= Shivleni - Jogai Mandir Cave Temple, Ambajogi|accessdate=23 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which date in King [[Udayaditya]] (reigned c. 1060–1087) to about  "In all, total excavations were hewn out of rock cut and carved deep inside the hill",  The caves include sculptures described by the government [[Archaeological Survey of India]] as "the finest surviving examples of Indian art", which are masterpieces with figures of the Hindu and depictions of the 'Hindu Puraan' tales.
[[File:Frontside of Shivleni.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.10 |Frontside view of Shivleni]]

The site is a listed in "[[List of State Protected Monuments in Maharashtra]]" - protected monument in the care of the Department of Archaeology of Maharashtra, India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00450000.html|title= General view of the Jogai Mandir Cave Temple, Ambajogi|accessdate=23 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the Maharashtra Ancient Monumnets and Archeological Sites &amp; Remains Act, 1960, the Shivleni Caves (Jogai Mandap) have been a [[Archaeological Survey of India]] Heritage Site.

==About==

Shivleni (Jogai Sabhamandap) Cave are situated hardly half a kilometer to the north-west of Yogeshvari Temple, along the banks of the river Jayvanti.  The caves are squares in shape and are carved deep inside the hill.  On the southern side of the hill is the entrance.  Inside mandap(pavilion) has an 8.36 sq m. court-yard in front and inside the roof is supported by four pillars.

==Inside Caves==
In the centre of the court-yard there is an elegantly carved nandimandap measuring 9.14x9.14 meters.  In the center of this mandap there is an image of nandi. The inside of the cave is impressive; one hall is supported by thirty two pillars and adorned with sculptures of Shiva and Ganesha.

==History and Inscription==
A inscription found here dated Saka 1066 records the grant as inams for the maintenance of these caves by the Rastrakuta king Udayaditya who was Mahamandalesvar.  This inscription has been removed to the Tahsildar's office at Ambajogai for safe custody and preservation.

There is a local story related to the monument. Which says that the monument is the wedding court of the ''jogaidevi,'' whose temple is situated nearby. It is said that the wedding was planned to take place in this ''mandap'' but couldn't take place due to some super natural reasons and the elephants and everything inside it turned to stone. That is why the name 'Jogai Mandap' is given to it. 

There is also a local belief that there is an underground tunnel in this ''Hattikhana'' which leads to Parli Vaijanath, which is around 25&amp;nbsp;km from there. But it was believed to have been shut down by the authorities.

==Protection==
The monument is now a state protected monument under the Maharashtra Ancient Monuments and archaeological sites &amp; Remains Act, 1960.

{{nihongo|Tetsuro Watsuji|和辻 哲郎|Watsuji Tetsurō|lead=yes}} (March 1, 1889 – December 26, 1960) was a [[Japan]]ese [[Ethics|moral philosopher]], [[Cultural history|cultural historian]], and [[Intellectual history|intellectual historian]].

==Early life==
Watsuji was born in [[Himeji, Hyōgo|Himeji]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] to a physician. During his youth he enjoyed poetry and had a passion for [[Western literature]]. For a short time he was the coeditor of a literary magazine and was involved in writing poems and plays. His interests in philosophy came to light while he was a student at First Higher School in Tokyo, although his interest in literature would always remain strong throughout his life.

In his early writings (between 1913 and 1915) he introduced the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to Japan, as well as working on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], but in 1918 he turned against this earlier position, criticizing Western philosophical [[individualism]], and attacking its influence on Japanese thought and life. This led to a study of the roots of Japanese culture, including Japanese [[Buddhist art]], and notably the work of the medieval [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] [[Dōgen]]. Watsuji was also interested in the famous Japanese writer [[Natsume Sōseki]], whose books were influential during Watsuji's early years.

==Career==
In the early 1920s Watsuji taught at [[Toyo University|Toyo]], [[Hosei University|Hosei]] and [[Keio University|Keio]] universities, and at [[Tsuda College|Tsuda Eigaku-juku]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. Dilworth, et al., ''Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy: Selected Documents'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press); cited in Robert Carter, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/watsuji-tetsuro/ Watsuji Tetsurô]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues of [[hermeneutics]] attracted his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michael F. (2002). {{google books|VCcLEBldTagC|''Japanese hermeneutics,'' pp. 76-88.|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Watsuji became professor of ethics at [[Kyoto University]], joining the other leading philosophers of the time, [[Nishida Kitaro]] and [[Tanabe Hajime]]. He then moved to the Tokyo Imperial University in 1934 and held the chair in ethics until 1949.

During [[World War II]] his theories (which claimed the superiority of Japanese approaches to and understanding of human nature and ethics, and argued for the negation of self) provided support for [[Japanese nationalism]], a fact which, after the war, he said that he regretted.

Watsuji died at the age of seventy-one.

==Work==
Watsuji's three main works were his two-volume 1954 ''History of Japanese Ethical Thought'', his three-volume ''Rinrigaku'' (''[[Ethics (Watsuji)|Ethics]]''), first published in 1937, 1942, and 1949, and his 1935 ''Fūdo''. The last of these develops his most distinctive thought. In it, Watsuji argues for an essential relationship between [[climate]] and other environmental factors and the nature of human [[culture]]s, and he distinguished three types of culture: pastoral, desert, and monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;The [[France|French]] philosopher [[Montesquieu]] had developed a theory along similar lines, though with very different conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Ukiyo-e'''{{efn|The obsolete transliteration ''ukiyo-ye'' appears in older texts.}}|浮世絵||{{IPA-ja|ɯkʲijoꜜe|pron}}; literally "picture[s] of the [[ukiyo|Floating World]]"|lead=yes}} is a genre of [[Japanese art]] which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries.  Its artists produced [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] and [[Nikuhitsu-ga|paintings]] of such subjects as female beauties; [[kabuki]] actors and [[sumo]] wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; [[Flora of Japan|flora]] and [[Wildlife of Japan#Fauna|fauna]]; and [[erotica]].

[[Edo]] (modern Tokyo) became the seat of government for the [[Shōgun|military dictatorship]] in the early 17th century.  The merchant class at the bottom of [[Four occupations|the social order]] benefited most from the city's rapid economic growth.  Many indulged in the entertainments of kabuki theatre, [[oiran|courtesans]], and [[geisha]] of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The term ''[[ukiyo]]'' ("floating world") came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle.  Printed or painted ''ukiyo-e'' images of this environment emerged in the late 17th century and were popular with the merchant class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.

The earliest success was in the 1670s with [[Hishikawa Moronobu|Moronobu]]'s paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women.  [[Colour printing|Colour in prints]] came gradually—at first added by hand for special commissions.  By the 1740s, artists such as [[Okumura Masanobu|Masanobu]] used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour.  From the 1760s the success of [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]]'s [[nishiki-e|"brocade prints"]] led to full-colour production becoming standard, each print made with numerous blocks.  Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]], [[Utamaro]], and [[Sharaku]] that came in the late 18th century.  In the 19th century followed a pair of masters best remembered for their landscapes: the bold formalist [[Hokusai]], whose ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' is one of the best-known works of Japanese art; and the serene, atmospheric [[Hiroshige]], most noted for his series ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]''.  Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.

Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints.  Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto [[Washi|hand-made paper]]; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works.  As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the [[Bokashi (printing)|blending or gradation of colours]] on the printing block.

Ukiyo-e was central to forming the West's perception of [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century–especially the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige.  From the 1870s [[Japonism]] became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Claude Monet|Monet]], as well as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] such as [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]] and [[Art Nouveau]] artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]].  The 20th century saw a revival in Japanese printmaking: the ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints") genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' ("creative prints") movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist.  Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.

==History==

===Pre-history===

Japanese art since the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) had followed two principal paths: the nativist ''{{transl|ja|[[Yamato-e]]}}'' tradition, focusing on Japanese themes, best known by the works of the [[Tosa school]]; and Chinese-inspired ''{{transl|ja|kara-e}}'' in a variety of styles, such as the monochromatic [[ink wash painting]] of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] and his disciples.  The [[Kanō school]] of painting incorporated features of both.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=8–9}}

Since antiquity, Japanese art had found patrons in the aristocracy, military governments, and religious authorities.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}  Until the 16th century, the lives of the common people had not been a main subject of painting, and even when they were included, the works were luxury items made for the ruling samurai and rich merchant classes.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=66–67}}  Later works appeared by and for townspeople, including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of the theatre and [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The hand-produced nature of these ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''{{efn|{{lang|ja|仕込絵}} ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''}} limited the scale of their production, a limit that was soon overcome by genres that turned to mass-produced [[woodblock printing]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=67–68}}

[[File:Kano Hideyori - Maple Viewers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A painted screen of six panels depicting a park-like setting in which visitors enjoy the scenery|''Maple Viewing at Takao'' (mid-16th century) by [[Kanō Hideyori]] is one of the earliest Japanese paintings to feature the lives of the common people.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}]]

During a [[Sengoku period|prolonged period of civil war]] in the 16th century, a class of politically powerful merchants had developed.  These {{illm|Machishū|ja|町衆|lt=''{{transl|ja|machishū}}''}}{{efn|{{nihongo||町衆|{{illm|machishū|ja|町衆}} }} }} allied themselves with the court and had power over local communities; their patronage of the arts encouraged a revival in the classical arts in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}}  In the early 17th century [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] (1543–1616) unified the country and was appointed ''[[shōgun]]'' with supreme power over Japan.  He consolidated [[Tokugawa shogunate|his government]] in the village of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo),{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}} and required the [[Daimyō|territorial lords]] to [[Sankin-kōtai|assemble there in alternate years]] with their entourages.  The demands of the growing capital drew many male labourers from the country, so that males came to make up nearly seventy percent of the population.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=17}}  The village grew during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) from a population of 1800 to over a million in the 19th century.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}

The centralized shogunate put an end to the power of the ''{{transl|ja|machishū}}'' and divided the population into [[Four occupations|four social classes]], with the ruling [[samurai]] class at the top and the merchant class at the bottom.  While deprived of their political influence,{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}} those of the merchant class most benefited from the rapidly expanding economy of the Edo period,{{sfn|Singer|1986|p=66}} and their improved lot allowed for leisure that many sought in the pleasure districts—in particular [[Yoshiwara]] in Edo{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}—and collecting artworks to decorate their homes, which in earlier times had been well beyond their financial means.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=6}}  The experience of the pleasure quarters was open to those of sufficient wealth, manners, and education.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}

[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|alt=Painting of a mediaeval Asian man seated and dressed in splendour|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established his government in the early 17th century in Edo (modern Tokyo).&lt;br/&gt;''Portrait of Tokugawa Ieyasu'', [[Kanō school]] painting, [[Kanō Tan'yū]], 17th century]]

[[Woodblock printing in Japan]] traces back to the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' in 770&amp;nbsp;CE.  Until the 17th century such printing was reserved for Buddhist seals and images.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  [[Movable type]] appeared around 1600, but as the [[Japanese writing system]] required about 100,000 type pieces,&lt;!-- this doesn't mean 100,000 characters in the writing system---it means that certain characters were used multiple times on the same page, and therefore multiples of the characters had to be available to the printer --&gt; hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient.  In [[Saga Domain]], calligrapher [[Honami Kōetsu]] and publisher {{Interlanguage link multi|Suminokura Soan|ja|3=角倉素庵}} combined printed text and images in an adaptation of ''[[The Tales of Ise]]'' (1608) and other works of literature.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  During the [[Kan'ei]] era (1624–1643) illustrated books of folk tales called ''{{transl|ja|tanrokubon}}'', or "orange-green books", were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the ''{{transl|ja|[[kanazōshi]]}}'' genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=69}}  The rebuilding of Edo following the [[Great Fire of Meireki]] in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=69–70}}

The term "ukiyo",{{efn|{{nihongo||浮世|ukiyo}} "floating world"}} which can be translated as "floating world", was [[Homophone|homophonous]] with an ancient Buddhist term signifying "this world of sorrow and grief".{{efn|{{nihongo||憂き世|ukiyo}} "world of sorrow"}}  The newer term at times was used to mean "erotic" or "stylish", among other meanings, and came to describe the hedonistic spirit of the time for the lower classes.  [[Asai Ryōi]] celebrated this spirit in the novel ''Ukiyo Monogatari'' ("''Tales of the Floating World''", {{circa|1661}}):{{sfn|Hickman|1978|pp=5–6}}

{{quote
|text = "living only for the moment, savouring the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms, and the maple leaves, singing songs, drinking sake, and diverting oneself just in floating, unconcerned by the prospect of imminent poverty, buoyant and carefree, like a gourd carried along with the river current: this is what we call ''ukiyo''."}}

===Emergence of ukiyo-e (late 17th&amp;nbsp;– early 18th centuries)===

The earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of [[Japanese painting]].{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  Yamato-e painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlines—this outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}

[[File:Hikone Screen.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A folding screen painted with Japanese figures at play against a gold background|The [[Hikone screen]] may be the oldest surviving ukiyo-e work, dating to {{circa|1624–44}}.]]

Around 1661, painted [[Kakemono|hanging scrolls]] known as ''Portraits of Kanbun Beauties'' gained popularity.  The paintings of the [[Kanbun (era)|Kanbun era]] (1661–73), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  The paintings of [[Iwasa Matabei]] (1578–1650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings.  Scholars disagree whether Matabei's work itself is ukiyo-e;{{sfn|Kita|1999|p=39}} assertions that he was the genre's founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}  At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned [[Hikone screen]],{{sfn|Kita|1999|pp=44–45}} a ''{{transl|ja|[[byōbu]]}}'' folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works.  The screen is in a refined Kanō style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.{{sfn|Yashiro|1958|pp=216, 218}}

[[File:Moronobu b-w shunga.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A black-and-white illustration of a pair of lovers in splendid dress at play|Early woodblock print, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]], late 1670s or early 1680s]]&lt;!-- there is a really nice coloured version of this print on Commons.  Please don't replace this one with it, as there are few monochrome prints in the article. --&gt;

In response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] (1618–1694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  By 1672, Moronobu's success was such that he began to sign his work—the first of the book illustrators to do so.  He was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres, and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties.  Most significantly, he began to produce illustrations, not just for books, but as single-sheet images, which could stand alone or be used as part of a series.  The Hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=70–71}} as well as imitators such as [[Sugimura Jihei]],{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=71–72}} and signalled the beginning of the popularization of a new artform.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=71}}

[[Torii Kiyonobu&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Kaigetsudō Ando]] became prominent emulators of Moronobu's style following the master's death, though neither was a member of the Hishikawa school.  Both discarded background detail in favour of focus on the human figure—[[kabuki]] actors in the ''[[yakusha-e]]'' of Kiyonobu and the [[Torii school]] that followed him,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–73}} and courtesans in the ''[[bijin-ga]]'' of Ando and his [[Kaigetsudō school]].  Ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–74}} and its popularity created a demand for paintings that other artists and schools took advantage of.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}  The Kaigetsudō school and its popular "Kaigetsudō beauty" ended after Ando's exile over his role in the [[Ejima-Ikushima affair|Ejima-Ikushima scandal]] of 1714.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=74–75}}

Kyoto native [[Nishikawa Sukenobu]] (1671–1750) painted technically refined pictures of courtesans.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  Considered a master of erotic portraits, he was the subject of a government ban in 1722, though it is believed he continued to create works that circulated under different names.{{sfn|Hibbett|2001|p=69}}  Sukenobu spent most of his career in Edo, and his influence was considerable in both the [[Kantō region|Kantō]] and [[Kansai region]]s.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  The paintings of [[Miyagawa Chōshun]] (1683–1752) portrayed early 18th-century life in delicate colours.  Chōshun made no prints.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=154}}  The [[Miyagawa school]] he founded in the early-18th century specialized in romantic paintings in a style more refined in line and colour than the Kaigetsudō school.  Chōshun allowed greater expressive freedom in his adherents, a group that later included [[Hokusai]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Colour prints (mid-18th century)===

Even in the earliest monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions.  Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with ''tan-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||丹|tan}}: a pigment made from red lead mixed with sulphur and [[Niter|saltpetre]]{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=76}} }} prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=76–77}}  These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted ''beni-e''{{efn|{{Nihongo||紅|beni}}: a pigment produced from [[safflower]] petals.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}} }} and later the lacquer-like ink of the ''[[urushi-e]]''.  In 1744, the ''[[benizuri-e]]'' were the first successes in colour printing, using multiple woodblocks—one for each colour, the earliest ''beni'' pink and vegetable green.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}

[[File:Okumura Masanobu - Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge.png|thumb|left|Western-style [[perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]] and increased use of printed colour were amongst the innovations [[Okumura Masanobu]] claimed.&lt;br/&gt;''Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge'', {{circa|1745}}]]

A great self-promoter, [[Okumura Masanobu]] (1686–1764) played a major role during the period of rapid technical development in printing from the late 17th to mid-18th centuries.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}  He established a shop in 1707{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=16}} and combined elements of the leading contemporary schools in a wide array of genres, though Masanobu himself belonged to no school.  Amongst the innovations in his romantic, lyrical images were the introduction of [[geometrical perspective]] in the ''[[uki-e]]'' genre{{efn|{{Interlanguage link multi|Torii Kiyotada|ja|3=鳥居清忠}} is said to have made the first ''uki-e'';{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}} Masanobu advertised himself as its innovator.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=78}}&lt;br /&gt;''A Layman's Explanation of the Rules of Drawing with a Compass and Ruler'' introduced Western-style geometrical perspective drawing to Japan in the 1734, based on a Dutch text of 1644 (see [[Rangaku]], "Dutch learning" during the Edo period); Chinese texts on the subject also appeared during the decade.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}&lt;br /&gt;Okumura likely learned about geometrical perspective from Chinese sources, some of which bear a striking resemblance to Okumura's works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=64–68}} }} in the 1740s;{{sfn|Suwa|1998|p=64}} the long, narrow ''hashira-e'' prints; and the combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self-penned [[haiku]] poetry.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=77–79}}

Ukiyo-e reached a peak in the late 18th century with the advent of full-colour prints, developed after Edo returned to prosperity under [[Tanuma Okitsugu]] following a long depression.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–81}}  These popular colour prints came to be called ''[[nishiki-e]]'', or "brocade pictures", as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang [[brocade]]s, known in Japanese as ''Shokkō nishiki''.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=82}}  The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very fine&lt;!---or finer than standard--&gt; paper with heavy, opaque inks.  These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year{{efn|Until 1873 the [[Japanese calendar]] was [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], and each year the [[Japanese New Year]] fell on different days of the [[Gregorian calendar]]'s January or February.}} as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist.  The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron's name and replacing it with that of the artist.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=150, 152}}

The delicate, romantic prints of [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (1725–1770) were amongst the first to realize expressive and complex colour designs,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=81}} printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}} and half-tones.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of [[waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry and [[Yamato-e]] painting.  The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=82–83}}  The success of Harunobu's colourful ''nishiki-e'' from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of ''benizuri-e'' and ''urushi-e'', as well as hand-coloured prints.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}}

A trend against the idealism of the prints of Harunobu and the Torii school grew following Harunobu's death in 1770.  [[Katsukawa Shunshō]] (1726–1793) and [[Katsukawa school|his school]] produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to the actors' actual features than had been the trend.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=83}}  Sometime-collaborators [[Koryūsai]] (1735&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|1790}}) and [[Kitao Shigemasa]] (1739–1820) were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo-e away from the dominance of Harunobu's idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real-world courtesans and [[geisha]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=84–85}}  Koryūsai was perhaps the most prolific ukiyo-e artist of the 17th century, and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|p=3}}  The [[Kitao school]] that Shigemasa founded was one of the dominant schools of the closing decades of the 18th century.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}}

In the 1770s, [[Utagawa Toyoharu]] produced a number of ''uki-e'' perspective prints{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=68}} that demonstrated a mastery of Western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in the genre.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}  Toyoharu's works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=1922|1p=224|2a1=Neuer|2a2=Libertson|2a3=Yoshida|2y=1990|2p=259}}  In 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques were absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, and deployed in the refined landscapes of such artists as Hokusai and [[Hiroshige]],{{sfn|Thompson|1986|p=44}} the latter a member of the [[Utagawa school]] that Toyoharu founded.  This school was to become one of the most influential,{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=204}} and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=105}}

===Peak period (late 18th century)===

[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Two Beauties with Bamboo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour print of a close-up of the head and upper torso of a finely dressed Japanese woman.  Behind her is a bamboo screen on which is depicted a similar woman's head and upper torso.|''Two Beauties with Bamboo''&lt;br/&gt;[[Utamaro]], {{circa|1795}}]]

While the late 18th century saw hard economic times,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=145}} ukiyo-e saw a peak in quantity and quality of works, particularly during the [[Kansei]] era (1789–1791).{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}  The ukiyo-e of the period of the [[Kansei Reforms]] brought about a focus on beauty and harmony{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in the next century as the reforms broke down and tensions rose, culminating in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}

Especially in the 1780s, [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815){{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} of the Torii school{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} depicted traditional ukiyo-e subjects like beauties and urban scenes, which he printed on large sheets of paper, often as multiprint horizontal [[diptych]]s or [[triptych]]s.  His works dispensed with the poetic dreamscapes made by Harunobu, opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in the latest fashions and posed in scenic locations.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=85–86}}  He also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=87}}

A law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold.  Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments.  From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval.{{sfn|Michener|1954|p=231}}  A group of Utagawa-school offenders including [[Utagawa Toyokuni|Toyokuni]] had their works repressed in 1801, and [[Utamaro]] was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader&lt;!-- the source calls him "Shogun", but Hideyoshi was never appointed shogun --&gt; [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}

Utamaro ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin ōkubi-e'' ("large-headed pictures of beautiful women") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}  By the end of the decade, especially following the death of his patron [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]] in 1797, Utamaro's prodigious output declined in quality,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=88–89}} and he died in 1806.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}

Appearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic [[Sharaku]] are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized the differences between the actor and the portrayed character.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}  The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  Published by Tsutaya,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}} Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared, and his real identity is still unknown.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=89–91}}  Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}

A consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo-e of the late 18th-century, but the works of Utamaro and Sharaku often overshadow those other masters  of the era.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  One of Kiyonaga's followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} [[Eishi]] (1756–1829), abandoned his position as painter for ''shōgun'' [[Tokugawa Ieharu]] to take up ukiyo-e design.  He brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful, slender courtesans, and left behind a number of noted students.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  With a fine line, [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (fl. 1786–1808) designed portraits of delicate courtesans.  The Utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo-e output in the late Edo period.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|pp=40–41}}

Edo was the primary centre of ukiyo-e production throughout the Edo period.  Another major centre developed in the [[Kamigata]] region of areas in and around [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]].  In contrast to the range of subjects in the Edo prints, those of Kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors.  The style of the Kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of Edo until the late 18th century, partly because artists often moved back and forth between the two areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=38}}  Colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in Kamigata prints than in those of Edo.{{sfn|Salter|2001|pp=12–13}}  In the 19th century many of the prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs.{{sfn|Winegrad|2007|pp=18–19}}

===Late flowering: flora, fauna, and landscapes (19th century)===

[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour illustration of a violent wave|[[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', 1831]]

The [[Tenpō Reforms]] of 1841–1843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury, including the depiction of courtesans and actors. As a result, many ukiyo-e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature, especially birds and flowers.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Landscapes had been given limited attention since Moronobu, and they formed an important element in the works of Kiyonaga and [[Katsukawa Shunchō|Shunchō]].  It was not until late in the Edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre, especially via the works of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The landscape genre has come to dominate Western perceptions of ukiyo-e, though ukiyo-e had a long history preceding these late-era masters.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}  The Japanese landscape differed from the Western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination, composition, and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=176–177}}

The self-proclaimed "mad painter" Hokusai (1760–1849) enjoyed a long, varied career.  His work is marked by a lack of the sentimentality common to ukiyo-e, and a focus on formalism influenced by Western art.  Among his accomplishments are his illustrations of [[Takizawa Bakin]]'s novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Crescent Moon (novel)|ja|3=椿説弓張月|lt=Crescent Moon}}'', his series of sketchbooks, the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', and his popularization of the landscape genre with ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=92–93}} which includes his best-known print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Honour|2a2=Fleming|2y=2005|2p=709|3a1=Benfey|3y=2007|3p=17|4a1=Addiss|4a2=Groemer|4a3=Rimer|4y=2006|4p=146|5a1=Buser|5y=2006|5p=168}} one of the most famous works of Japanese art.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Belloli|2y=1999|2p=98}}  In contrast to the work of the older masters, Hokusai's colours were bold, flat, and abstract, and his subject was not the pleasure districts but the lives and environment of the common people at work.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=158}}  Established masters [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]], [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], and [[Kunisada]] also followed Hokusai's steps into landscape prints in the 1830s, producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=84–85}}

Though not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period.  The prolific Kunisada (1786–1865) had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=284–285}}  One of those rivals was Eisen (1790–1848), who was also adept at landscapes.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had.  His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular,{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}} especially his series of heroes from the ''[[Water Margin|Suikoden]]'' (1827–1830) and ''[[Chūshingura]]'' (1847).{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=153–154}} He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}}

Hiroshige (1797–1858) is considered Hokusai's greatest rival in stature.  He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]'' and ''[[The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=94–95}} the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  His work was more realistic, subtly coloured, and atmospheric than Hokusai's; nature and the seasons were key elements: mist, rain, snow, and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|pp=158–159}}  Hiroshige's followers, including [[Japanese adult adoption|adopted]] son [[Hiroshige II]] and son-in-law [[Hiroshige III]], carried on their master's style of landscapes into the Meiji era.{{sfn|King|2010|p=116}}

===Decline (late 19th century)===

Following the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}} and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Michener|1y=1959|1p=200|2a1=Kobayashi|2y=1997|2p=95}}  The rapid Westernization of the [[Meiji period]] that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism, and face competition from photography.  Practitioners of pure ukiyo-e became more rare, and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolescent era.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}}  Artists continued to produce occasional notable works, but by the 1890s the tradition was moribund.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1y=1997|1p=95|2a1=Faulkner|2a2=Robinson|2y=1999|2pp=22–23|3a1=Kobayashi|3y=1997|3p=95|4a1=Michener|4y=1959|4p=200}}

Synthetic pigments imported from Germany began to replace traditional organic ones in the mid-19th century.  Many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red, and were called ''[[aka-e]]'' ("red pictures").{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=71}}  Artists such as [[Yoshitoshi]] (1839–1892) led a trend in the 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts,{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} monsters and supernatural beings, and legendary Japanese and Chinese heroes.  His ''One Hundred Aspects of the Moon'' (1885–1892) depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=153}}  [[Kobayashi Kiyochika|Kiyochika]] (1847–1915) is known for his prints documenting the rapid modernization of Tokyo, such as the introduction of railways, and his depictions of Japan's wars [[First Sino-Japanese War|with China]] and [[Russo-Japanese War|with Russia]].{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} Earlier a painter of the Kanō school, in the 1870s [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Chikanobu]] (1838–1912) turned to prints, particularly of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial family]] and scenes of Western influence on Japanese life in the Meiji period.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1986|pp=125–126}}

===Introduction to the West===

Aside from Dutch traders, who had had [[Japan–Netherlands relations|trading relations]] dating to the beginning of the Edo period,{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid-19th century, and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  Swedish naturalist [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement [[Dejima]], near Nagasaki, and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints.  The export of ukiyo-e thereafter slowly grew, and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant-trader [[Isaac Titsingh]]'s collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=48}}

[[File:Japanese Satsuma pavillion at the French expo 1867.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photo of a traditional-style Japanese building|The Japanese Satsuma pavilion at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]] ]]

The arrival in Edo of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1853 led to the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854, which opened Japan to the outside world after [[Sakoku|over two centuries of seclusion]].  Ukiyo-e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s, and by the 1850s were numerous;{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} reception was mixed, and even when praised ukiyo-e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|pp=680–681}}  Japanese art drew notice at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]],{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=675}}  At the time of their introduction to the West, woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan, and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=12}}

Early Europeans promoters and scholars of ukiyo-e and Japanese art included writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and art critic [[Philippe Burty]],{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=7}} who coined the term "[[Japonism]]".{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}}{{efn|Burty coined the term ''{{lang|fr|le Japonisme}}'' in French in 1872.{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}} }}  Stores selling Japanese goods opened, including those of Édouard Desoye in 1862 and art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] in 1875.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=89}}  From 1888 to 1891 Bing published the magazine ''[[Artistic Japan]]''{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=96}} in English, French, and German editions,{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=6}} and curated an ukiyo-e exhibition at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1890 attended by artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]].{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=90}}

[[File:Debussy - La Mer - The great wave of Kanaga from Hokusai.jpg|thumb|alt=Cover of book of sheet music depicting a stylized wave|Not only the visual arts but also music drew inspiration from ukiyo-e in the West: the cover of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).]]

American [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the earliest Western devotee of Japanese culture, and did much to promote Japanese art—Hokusai's works featured prominently at his inaugural exhibition as first curator of Japanese art [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston, and in Tokyo in 1898 he curated the first ukiyo-e exhibition in Japan.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=101–103}} By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of ukiyo-e in the West drove prices beyond the means of most collectors—some, such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], traded their own paintings for such prints.  [[Tadamasa Hayashi]] was a prominent Paris-based dealer of respected tastes whose Tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo-e prints to the West in such quantities that Japanese critics later accused him of siphoning Japan of its national treasure.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=96–97}}  The drain first went unnoticed in Japan, as Japanese artists were immersing themselves in the classical painting techniques of the West.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=15}}

Japanese art, and particularly ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western art from the time of the early [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s.{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}}  Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s:{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} the patterned wallpapers and rugs in [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s paintings were inspired by ukiyo-e's patterned kimonos, and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=17}}  [[Vincent van Gogh|Van&amp;nbsp;Gogh]] was an avid collector, and painted [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|copies in oil]] of prints by Hiroshige and [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1989|p=230}}  Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=37–39, 45}}  Ukiyo-e's flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|pp=90–91}}  [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e's flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include [[Claude Monet|Monet]],{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}} [[John La Farge|La Farge]],{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=99}} [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]],{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=96}} and [[Les Nabis]] members such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]]{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=56}} and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]].{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=67}}  French composer [[Claude Debussy]] drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Horoshige, most prominently in ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).{{sfn|Gerstle|Milner|1995|p=70}}  [[Imagism|Imagist]] poets such as [[Amy Lowell]] and [[Ezra Pound]] found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called ''Pictures of the Floating World'' (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.{{sfn|Hughes|1960|p=213}}

===Descendant traditions (20th century)===

[[File:Yamamoto 1904.jpg|thumb|alt=Monochromatic print of a man in a heavy coat standing, looking away from the viewer at the ocean|''Fisherman''&lt;br/&gt;[[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]], 1904]]
The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=119, 121}}  In 1915, publisher [[Shōzaburō Watanabe]] introduced the term ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  Prominent artists included [[Goyō Hashiguchi]], called the "Utamaro of the [[Taishō period]]" for his manner of depicting women; [[Shinsui Itō]], who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women;{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=22|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}} and [[Hasui Kawase]], who made modern landscapes.{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=23|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}}  Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English [[Charles W. Bartlett]] (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and [[Hiroshi Yoshida]] set up studios to publish their own work.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=21}}

Artists of the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' ("creative prints") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] (1882–1946), then a student at the [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo School of Fine Arts]], is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced ''Fisherman'' using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=109}}  The foundation of the [[Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association]] in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles.{{sfn|Statler|1959|p=39}}  Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of [[Kōshirō Onchi]] (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of [[Un'ichi Hiratsuka]] (1895–1997).{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=35–38}}

&lt;!-- let's avoid using "kindai hanga" -- the term isn't set in stone the way "shin-hanga" and "sōsaku-hanga" are --&gt;Prints from the late-20th and 21st centuries have evolved from the concerns of earlier movements, especially the sōsaku-hanga movement's emphasis on individual expression.  [[Screen printing]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[mixed media]], and other Western methods have joined traditional woodcutting amongst printmakers' techniques.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999}}

Early ukiyo-e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in the composition principles of classical [[Chinese painting]]; gradually these artists shed the overt Chinese influence to develop a native Japanese idiom.  The early ukiyo-e artists have been called "Primitives" in the sense that the print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries-old techniques—their image designs are not considered "primitive".{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=9–11}}  Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kanō and other painterly schools.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=9}}

A defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2004|1p=xiv|2a1=Michener|2y=1959|2p=11}}  The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=11–12}}  In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} with figures typically in a single plane of depth.  Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xvi}}  Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above.  Elements of images were often [[Cropping (image)|cropped]], giving the composition a spontaneous feel.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=298}}  In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}  The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome [[Ink wash painting|ink brushstrokes]] of [[zenga]] brush painting or tonal colours of the [[Kanō school]] of painting.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}

[[File:Black Raku Tea Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of a tea bowl, dark-coloured, humble, and asymmetric|''[[Wabi-sabi]]'' aesthetic in a 16th-century tea bowl]]

The colourful, ostentatious, and complex patterns, concern with changing fashions, and tense, dynamic poses and compositions in ukiyo-e are in striking contrast with many concepts in traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]].  Prominent amongst these, ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' favours simplicity, asymmetry, and imperfection, with evidence of the passage of time;{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=50–52}} and ''[[shibui]]'' values subtlety, humility, and restraint.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=53–54}}  Ukiyo-e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as the racy, urbane stylishness of ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]''.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=66}}

Ukiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period.  Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan—practised most prominently by the [[Akita ranga]] painters of the 1770s—as were Chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines.  The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=57–60}}  The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=62–63}}  Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=106–107}}  Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method&lt;!-- 三部構図法 --&gt; used in Buddhist pictures,&lt;!-- 仏画 --&gt; where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai's ''Great Wave'', with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=108–109}}

There was a tendency since early ukiyo-e to pose beauties in what art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Midori Wakakura|ja|3=若桑みどり}} called a "serpentine posture",{{efn|{{lang|ja|蛇体姿勢}} ''{{transl|ja|jatai shisei}}'', "serpentine posture"}} which involves the subjects' bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves.  Art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Motoaki Kōno|ja|3=河野元昭}} posited that this had its roots in traditional [[buyō]] dance; {{Interlanguage link multi|Haruo Suwa|ja|3=諏訪春雄}} countered that the poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo-e artists, causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes.  This remained the case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of the composition.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=101–106}}

===Themes and genres===

Typical subjects were female beauties ("'[[bijin-ga]]'"), kabuki actors ("'[[yakusha-e]]'"), and landscapes.  The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}  The detail with which artists depicted courtesans' fashions and hairstyles allows the prints to be dated with some reliability.  Less attention was given to accuracy of the women's physical features, which followed the day's pictorial fashions—the faces stereotyped, the bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another.{{sfn|Hillier|1954|p=20}}  Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular those from the kabuki and [[sumo]] worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=95, 98}}  While the landscape has come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished relatively late in the ukiyo-e's history.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}

[[File:Suzuki Harunobu - Evening Snow on the Heater.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour print of two finely dressed Japanese women by a heater.

The wallpaper and other items in this [[nishiki-e|brocade print]] are extensively [[paper embossing|embossed]].&lt;br/&gt;''[[Evening Snow on the Nurioke]]'', [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], 1766]]

Ukiyo-e prints grew out of book illustration—many of Moronobu's earliest single-page prints were originally pages from books he had illustrated.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  ''[[E-hon]]'' books of illustrations were popular{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=41}} and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo-e artists. In the late period, Hokusai produced the three-volume ''One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji'' and the fifteen-volume ''Hokusai Manga'', the latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=38, 41}}

Traditional Japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in the [[Judaeo-Christian]] sense,{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=124}} and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, [[shunga]] erotic prints were a major genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Seton|1y=2010|1p=64|2a1=Harris|2y=2011|p=119}}  While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors' approval.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}  Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=64}}  As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}  Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=128}}  Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though [[Timon Screech]] posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}

Scenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history.  Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times.  Ukiyo-e nature prints are called ''[[kachō-e]]'', which translates as "flower-and-bird pictures", though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Hokusai's detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing ''kachō-e'' as a genre.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=134}}

The Tenpō Reforms of the 1840s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans.  Aside from landscapes and ''kachō-e'', artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion.  The 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} and the 13th-century ''[[The Tale of the Heike|Tale of the Heike]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=155–156}} have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout Japanese history,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} including in ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}}  Well-known warriors and swordsmen such as [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584–1645) were frequent subjects, as were depictions of monsters, the supernatural, and heroes of [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] and [[Chinese mythology]].{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=148, 153}}

From the 17th to 19th centuries [[Sakoku|Japan isolated itself]] from the rest of the world.  Trade, primarily with the Dutch and Chinese, was restricted to the island of [[Dejima]] near [[Nagasaki]].  Outlandish pictures called ''Nagasaki-e'' were sold to tourists of the foreigners and their wares.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  In the mid-19th century, [[Yokohama]] became the primary foreign settlement after 1859, from which Western knowledge proliferated in Japan.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163–164}}  Especially from 1858 to 1862 ''[[Yokohama-e]]'' prints documented, with various levels of fact and fancy, the growing community of world denizens with whom the Japanese were now coming in contact;{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=166–167}} triptychs of scenes of Westerners and their technology were particularly popular.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=170}}

Specialized prints included ''[[surimono]]'', deluxe, limited-edition prints aimed at connoisseurs, of which a five-line [[kyōka]] poem was usually part of the design;{{sfn|King|2010|p=111}} and ''[[uchiwa-e]]'' printed [[hand fan]]s, which often suffer from having been handled.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}

===Paintings===

{{Main|Nikuhitsu-ga}}

Ukiyo-e artists often made both prints and paintings; some specialized in one or the other.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours,{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xii}} and often delineated contours with [[inkstick|sumi ink]], an effect similar to the linework in prints.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=236}}  Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, a wider range of techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=235–236}}  Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as [[safflower]], ground shells, lead, and [[cinnabar]],{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=29, 34}} and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as [[Paris green]] and Prussian blue.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=35–36}}  Silk or paper  ''[[kakemono]]'' hanging scrolls, ''makimono'' [[handscroll]]s, or ''[[byōbu]]'' folding screens were the most common surfaces.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}

[[File:Yoshiiku (1862) key block face b.jpg|thumb|alt=Carved woodblock for printing|Key block for ukiyo-e print, [[Utagawa Yoshiiku]], 1862]]

{{Main article|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

Ukiyo-e prints were the works of teams of artisans in several workshops;{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=21}}  Labour was divided into four groups: the publisher, who commissioned, promoted, and distributed the prints; the artists, who provided the design image; the woodcarvers, who prepared the woodblocks for printing; and the printers, who made impressions of the woodblocks on paper.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=11}}  Normally only the names of the artist and publisher were credited on the finished print.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=61}}

Ukiyo-e prints were impressed on [[Washi|hand-made paper]]{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=11}} manually, rather than by mechanical press as in the West.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}}  The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}} to a block of cherry wood{{efn|Traditional Japanese woodblocks were cut along the grain, as opposed to the blocks of Western [[wood engraving]], which were cut across the grain.  In both methods, the dimensions of the woodblock was limited by the girth of the tree.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=34–35}}  In the 20th century, [[plywood]] became the material of choice for Japanese woodcarvers, as it is cheaper, easier to carve, and less limited in size.{{sfnm|1a1=Statler|1y=1959|1pp=34–35|2a1=Salter|2y=2001|1p=64}} }} and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The original drawing was destroyed in the process.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}}

Prints were made with blocks face up so the printer could vary pressure for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based sumi ink,{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}} applied quickly in even horizontal strokes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=225}}  Amongst the printer's tricks were [[Paper embossing|embossing]] of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=246}}  Other effects included burnishing{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}} by rubbing with [[agate]] to brighten colours;{{sfn|Frédéric|2002|p=884}} [[varnish]]ing; [[overprinting]]; dusting with metal or [[mica]]; and sprays to imitate falling snow.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}}

The ukiyo-e print was a commercial art form, and the publisher played an important role.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period.  The number peaked at around 250 in the 1840s and 1850s{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}}—200 in Edo alone{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=19}}—and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 40 remained at the opening of the 20th century.  The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 18th century enforced copyrights{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}} through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild.{{efn|{{nihongo||地本問屋|Jihon Toiya}} "Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild"{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}} }}{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter.  The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=18}}  Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each other's wares in their shops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  In addition to the artist's seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals—some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Tsutaya Jūzaburō seal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A publisher's seal in the shape of a flower within a stylized mountain|The publisher's seal of [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]], who published [[Utamaro]] and [[Sharaku]] in the 1790s]]

Print designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks.  As the artists gained fame publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.{{sfn|Marks|2012|pp=13–14}}

In pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood ''{{transl|ja|yōmyō}}'' personal name different from their ''zokumyō'' name as an adult.  An artist's name consisted of a ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' artist surname followed by an ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' personal art name.  The ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=22}} and the ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' normally took a Chinese character from the master's art name—for example, many students of Toyokuni (豊国) took the "kuni" (国) from his name, including Kunisada (国貞) and Kuniyoshi (国芳).{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  The names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers;{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=ix–x}}  Hokusai was an extreme case, using over a hundred names throughout his seventy-year career.{{sfn|Link|Takahashi|1977|p=32}}

The prints were mass-marketed{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}} and by the mid-19th century total circulation of a print could run into the thousands.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=153—154}}  Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=2011|1p=62|2a1=Meech-Pekarik|2y=1982|2p=93}}  In some cases the prints advertised [[kimono]] designs by the print artist.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  From the second half of the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}} each print stamped with the series name and the print's number in that series.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}  This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}  By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige's ''Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō'' ran to dozens of prints.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}

====Colour print production====

While [[colour printing]] in Japan dates to the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink.  Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in ''tan-e'' prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in ''beni-e'' prints.  Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour.  Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The mid-1760s brought full-colour ''nishiki-e'' prints{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} made from ten or more woodblocks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ishizawa|1a2=Tanaka|1y=1986|1p=38|2a1=Merritt|2y=1990|2p=18}}  To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly [[Printing registration|registration marks]] called ''kentō'' were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}

[[File:Pigment Berliner Blau.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of a dish of deep blue powder|[[Prussian blue]] was a prominent synthetic dye in the 19th century.]]

Printers first used [[Natural dye|natural colour dyes]] made from mineral or vegetable sources.  The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from [[Primary color|primary]] red, blue, and yellow pigments.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}}  In the 18th century, [[Prussian blue]] became popular, and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}} as was ''[[bokashi (printing)|bokashi]]'', where the printer produced gradations of colour or the blending of one colour into another.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}  Cheaper and more consistent synthetic [[aniline]] dyes arrived from the West in 1864.  The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments.  The [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=234}}

==Criticism and historiography==

Contemporary records of ukiyo-e artists are rare.  The most significant is the ''[[Ukiyo-e Ruikō]]'' ("''Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e''"), a collection of commentaries and artist biographies.  [[Ōta Nanpo]] compiled the first, no-longer-extant version around 1790.  The work did not see print during the Edo era, but circulated in hand-copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations;{{sfn|Takeuchi|2004|pp=118, 120}} over 120 variants of the ''Ukiyo-e Ruikō'' are known.{{sfn|Tanaka|1999|p=190}}

Before World War II, the predominant view of ukiyo-e stressed the centrality of prints; this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo-e's founding to Moronobu.  Following the war, thinking turned to the importance of ukiyo-e painting and making direct connections with 17th-century Yamato-e paintings; this viewpoint sees Matabei as the genre's originator, and is especially favoured in Japan.  This view had become widespread among Japanese researchers by the 1930s, but the militaristic government of the time suppressed it, wanting to emphasize a division between the Yamato-e scroll paintings associated with the court, and the prints associated with the sometimes anti-authoritarian merchant class.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}

[[File:Ernest Fenollosa.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A black-and-white profile photograph of the head and shoulders of a middle-aged bearded man, facing left|American scholar of Japanese art [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the first to complete a comprehensive critical history of ukiyo-e.]]

The earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo-e came from the West.  Ernest Fenollosa was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in Tokyo from 1878, and was Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese government from 1886.  His ''Masters of {{not a typo|Ukioye}}'' of 1896 was the first comprehensive overview and set the stage for most later works with an approach to the history in terms of epochs: beginning with Matabei in a primitive age, it evolved towards a late-18th-century golden age that began to decline with the advent of Utamaro, and had a brief revival with Hokusai and Hiroshige's landscapes in the 1830s.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=3–5}}  [[Laurence Binyon]], the Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote an account in ''Painting in the Far East'' in 1908 that was similar to Fenollosa's, but placed Utamaro and Sharaku amongst the masters.  [[Arthur Davison Ficke]] built on the works of Fenollosa and Binyon with a more comprehensive ''Chats on Japanese Prints'' in 1915.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=8–10}}  [[James&amp;nbsp;A. Michener]]'s ''The Floating World'' in 1954 broadly followed the chronologies of the earlier works, while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing the earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=12}}  For Michener and his sometime collaborator [[Richard Douglas Lane|Richard Lane]], ukiyo-e began with Moronobu rather than Matabei.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=20}}  Lane's ''Masters of the Japanese Print'' of 1962 maintained the approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo-e firmly within the genealogy of Japanese art.  The book acknowledges artists such as Yoshitoshi and Kiyochika as late masters.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=13–14}}

{{Interlanguage link multi|Seiichirō Takahashi|ja|3=高橋誠一郎}}'s ''Traditional Woodblock Prints of Japan'' of 1964 placed ukiyo-e artists in three periods: the first was a primitive period that included Harunobu, followed by a golden age of Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku, and then a closing period of decline following the declaration beginning in the 1790s of strict [[sumptuary law]]s that dictated what could be depicted in artworks.  The book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had,{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=14–15}} and viewed ukiyo-e painting as a revival of Yamato-e painting.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}  {{Interlanguage link multi|Tadashi Kobayashi|ja|3=小林忠}} further refined Takahashi's analysis by identifying the decline as coinciding with the desperate attempts of the shogunate to hold on to power through the passing of draconian laws as its hold on the country continued to break down, culminating in the Meiji Restoration in 1868.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=15–16}}

Ukiyo-e scholarship has tended to focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas.  Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses.  Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=13–14}}  While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=5–6}}

Standards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature.  Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e's decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the form's greatest masters.  Artists of the 19th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 20th century.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=17–18}}  Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed.  Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=19–20}}

Novelist [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] was critical of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e.  He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners' values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the West's flaunting of the discovery.{{sfn|Yoshimoto|2003|p=65–66}}

[[File:Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white comic strip in Japanese|[[Manga]] histories often find an ancestor in the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]''.&lt;br/&gt;[[Rakuten Kitazawa]], ''Tagosaku to Mokube no Tōkyō Kenbutsu'',{{efn|''{{transl|ja|Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu}}'' {{lang|ja|田吾作と杢兵衛の東京見物}} ''Tagosaku and Mokube Sightseeing in Tokyo''}} 1902]]

Since the dawn of the 20th century historians of ''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}''—Japanese comics and cartooning—have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre-20th-century Japanese art.  Particular emphasis falls on the ''Hokusai Manga'' as a precursor, though Hokusai's book is not narrative, nor does the term ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' originate with Hokusai.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=28–29}}  In English and other languages the word ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' is used in the restrictive sense of "Japanese comics" or "Japanese-style comics",{{sfn|Stewart|2014|p=30}} while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=336}} and caricature.{{sfn|Morita|2010|p=33}}

==Collection and preservation==

The ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=140, 175}}  Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived.  They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}  Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=149}}  Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called ''azuma-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||東絵|azuma-e}} "pictures of the Eastern capital"}} ("pictures of the Eastern capital") as souvenirs.  Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}

The ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=140}}  Little concrete is known about production and consumption habits.  Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain—or perhaps ever existed.  Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=7–8}}

Determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size,{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=216}} supply and demand,{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=31}} and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=32}}  How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|pp=216—217}}  In the 19th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 ''{{transl|ja|[[Japanese mon (currency)|mon]]}}''{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=151—153}} to 100 ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' for deluxe editions.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=217}}  Jun'ichi Ōkubo suggests that prices in the 20s and 30s of ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' were likely common for standard prints.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=43}}  As a loose comparison, a bowl of [[soba]] noodles in the early 19th century typically sold for 16 ''mon''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1a2=Ōkubo|1y=1994|1p=217|2a1=Bell|2y=2004|2p=174}}

[[File:Ichiyōsai Yoshitaki pre-fade post-fade.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour print illustration of a Japanese woman crouching.  The image combines two photos of the same image.  The right side of the photo is faded.|Ukiyo-e prints are sensitive to light.  The left half shows this print in 1989, the right shows the same print after being on display until 2001.&lt;br/&gt;[[Utagawa Yoshitaki]], 19th century]]

The dyes in ukiyo-e prints are susceptible to fading when exposed even to low levels of light; this makes long-term display undesirable.  The paper they are printed on deteriorates when it comes in contact with [[acid]]ic materials, so storage boxes, folders, and mounts must be of neutral pH or [[Alkalinity|alkaline]].  Prints should be regularly inspected for problems needing treatment, and stored at a [[relative humidity]] of 70% or less to prevent fungal discolourations.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2001}}

The paper and pigments in ukiyo-e paintings are sensitive to light and seasonal changes in humidity.  Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity.  In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain [[Paulownia tomentosa|paulownia]] boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=61}}  In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution.  Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causes creasing.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=75}}  Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; brittleness results from too dry a level.{{sfn|Toishi|1979|p=25}}

Because ukiyo-e prints were mass-produced, collecting them presents considerations different from the collecting of paintings.  There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints.  Prints may have stains, [[foxing]], wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or they may have been retouched.  Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions.  When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=180, 183–184}}  Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist's reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing—even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002a}}  As of 2016, the record price for an ukiyo-e print sold at auction was {{€|link=yes}}{{val|745000}} for Utamaro's ''[[Fukaku Shinobu Koi]]'' ({{circa|1793–94}}).{{sfn|AFP–Jiji staff|2016}}

Ukiyo-e prints often went through multiple editions, sometimes with changes made to the blocks in later editions.  Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2005}}  Takamizawa Enji (1870–1927), a producer of ukiyo-e reproductions, developed a method of recutting woodblocks to print fresh colour on faded originals, over which he used tobacco ash to make the fresh ink seem aged.  These refreshed prints he resold as original printings.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=36}}  Amongst the defrauded collectors was American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who brought {{val|1500}} Takamizawa prints with him from Japan to the US, some of which he had sold before the truth was discovered.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002b}}

Ukiyo-e artists are referred to in the Japanese style, the surname preceding the personal name, and well-known artists such as Utamaro and Hokusai by personal name alone.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=313}}  Dealers normally refer to ukiyo-e prints by the names of [[Woodblock printing in Japan#Print sizes|the standard sizes]], most commonly the {{convert|34.5|x|22.5|cm|in|adj=on}} ''aiban'', the {{convert|22.5|x|19|cm|in|adj=on}} ''chūban'', and the {{convert|38|x|23|cm|in|adj=on}} ''ōban''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}—precise sizes vary, and paper was often trimmed after printing.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=40}}

Many of the largest high-quality collections of ukiyo-e lie outside Japan.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}}  Examples entered the collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] in the first half of the 19th century.  The [[British Museum]] began a collection in 1860{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=38}} that by the late 20th century numbered {{val|70000}} items.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=13–14}}  The largest, surpassing {{val|100000}} items, resides in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}} begun when Ernest Fenollosa donated his collection in 1912.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=39}}  The first exhibition in Japan of ukiyo-e prints was likely one presented by [[Kōjirō Matsukata]] in 1925, who amassed his collection in Paris during World War&amp;nbsp;I and later donated it to the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]].{{sfn|Checkland|2004|p=107}}  The largest collection of ukiyo-e in Japan is the {{val|100000}} pieces in the [[Japan Ukiyo-e Museum]] in the [[Matsumoto, Nagano|city of Matsumoto]].{{sfn|Garson|2001|p=14}}

'''Wilhelm  Mautner''' (1889-1944) was born in [[Vienna]]. He was an Austrian-German economist and attorney-in-fact of the Rotterdamse Bank who spent a part of his life in the Netherlands. Mautner was born Jewish. He was also an art collector.

==Early years==
After a short professional career in banking and industry, he studied economics in Paris, Vienna and Tübingen, where he finished his studies and wrote a thesis about Bolshevism in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mautner|first1=Wilhelm|title=Der Bolschewismus - Voraussetzungen und Geschichte|publisher=W. Kohlhammer|location=Stuttgart|edition=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he moved to the Netherlands.

==World War II==

From 1929 until 1944 he lived in Amsterdam. Mautner never married and had no children. On 22 July 1941, he drew up a will in which he appointed his brother in Ohio in the United States as his sole heir. During the war Mautner attempted unsuccessfully to escape from the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/recommendations/recommendation_189_a.html All the information used for this article is from the Restitutions Committee] [RC. 1.89]-[9 February 2009], unless otherwise specified. &lt;/ref&gt; Mautner tried to get an exit visa for the United States with the help of his brother, who lived in New York. In December 1943 Mautner was removed from his home in Amsterdam during a raid and transported to [[Westerbork transit camp]] and from there to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]]&lt;ref&gt;Prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt (1940-1945) Database Personal records&lt;/ref&gt; concentration camp. Mautner died on or around 29 September 1944 in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

==Art collection==

Mautner collected paintings. His collection also included some Dutch old masters. He continued purchasing works of art during the war. At that time he was in frequent contact with [[Max Jakob Friedlander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprovenance.nl/varia/|title=Ruth Kaloena Krul - Kunsthistorische Herkomst|website=www.artprovenance.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, he was no longer able to do so in his own name because of his Jewish origins. He gave works of art to various people for safekeeping. In February 1942, Mautner was ordered to move to Tugelaweg in Amsterdam as a result of the forced relocation of Jews. He sent 15 paintings for safe-keeping with the collector Dr J. van Dongen on the city's Museumplein. The latter kept all of these items until after the war. Other works, including a Brueghel and a Timmermann, were sold under duress in 1943 by Mautner. Various of Mautner's works of art and other possessions were recovered for his heirs, by custodians of his estate after the war. The 15 paintings in J.A. van Dongen's custody were probably bought by van Dongen with the consent of Mautner's heirs.
Three of the paintings that Mautner sold under duress are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The latter two were acquired by the [[Führermuseum|Sonderauftrag Linz]] and returned to the Netherlands after the war, where they became part of the NK-Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl, Search, Undirected Search, "Mautner", retrieved April 8, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sold 12 paintings, primarily 19th century, to W. Kadzik from Vienna. Mautner could not act as a seller, due to his Jewish origin, so he asked his friend Hans Alfred Wetzlar to fulfill the formalities. It is unknown where the works are.

'''''William Formby Halsall''''' (born 1841 - November 7 1919) was a [[marine painter]] born in [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]], [[England]]. He lived at [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] and died as a US citizen.

== Marine life &amp; Fresco painting ==

Halsall was educated in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and worked as a sailor for seven years from 1852 to 1859. In 1860, he had begun to study [[fresco painting]] but due to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], he enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. He resumed his fresco study after two years of service.

== Marine painting ==

In 1862, Halsall changed to marine painting and studied at the [[Lowell Institute]] in Boston until 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/askart/h/william_formby_halsall/william_formby_halsall.aspx Short Biography @ AskART.com] Retrieved June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Halsall was also a founding member of the [[Provincetown Art Association and Museum|Provincetown Art Association]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;http://paam.org/archives.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17124">{{See also|Sculpture of Zimbabwe}}
'''Zimbabwean [[art]]''' includes decorative [[esthetics]] applied to many aspects of life, including [[art object]]s as such, utilitarian objects, objects used in religion, warfare, in [[propaganda]], and in many other spheres. Within this broad arena, [[Zimbabwe]] has several identifiable categories of art. It is a hallmark of [[African culture]]s in general that art touches many aspects of life, and most tribes have a vigorous and often recognisable canon of styles and a great range of art-worked objects. These can include [[mask]]s, [[drum]]s, [[textile]] decoration, beadwork, carving, [[Sculpture of Zimbabwe|sculpture]], [[ceramic]] in various forms, housing and the person themselves. Decoration of the body in permanent ways such as [[scarification]] or [[tattoo]] or impermanently as in painting the body for a ceremony is a common feature of African cultures.

Spoken or musical art is also a prominent part of Africas generally. Various instruments including drums, lamellophones and stringed bows have been used in Zimbabwe, while oratory, poetry, fable telling, praise singing and tribal ritual chants are also prominent.

In recent decades Zimbabwe has become widely recognized internationally for its [[Sculpture of Zimbabwe|sculpture]].

==History==
It is useful to examine Zimbabwean art through time, by area, by main tribal division and as indicative of recent historic and political changes.

There is an artistic tradition in [[Zimbabwe]] that can be traced back to [[pottery]] of the [[Early Stone Age|Early]] and [[Late Stone Age]] and [[rock paintings]] from the Late Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;Winter-Irving C. (1991) "Visual Culture in Early History", Chapter 8 in "Stone Sculpture in Zimbabwe", Roblaw Publishers, [[Harare]], {{ISBN|0908309147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many rock paintings produced by [[Bushmen|San]] artists between 10000 and 2000 years ago are found in cultural sites in Zimbabwe &lt;ref&gt;Garlake P S. (1993) "Painted Caves: Prehistoric Art in Zimbabwe", Modus Publications Pvt. Ltd, {{ISBN|0908309007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these demonstrate a high degree of skill in drawing. Many depict recognisable animal figures and use shading and colour to enhance the visual impact. The [[archaeology]] of Zimbabwe includes numerous pottery finds, which assist in the reconstruction of linguistic and cultural groupings within what is here termed [[Shona people|Shona]].&lt;ref&gt;Beach D N. (1980) "Shona and Zimbabwe 900-1850: An Outline of Shona History", Heinemann, {{ISBN|043594505X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery indicates that the people of the [[Late Iron Age]] were settled [[agriculturists]] and they have been categorised as forming groups such as the Harare culture and the Leopard’s Kopje culture: the latter established in 980 AD in a site called K2.&lt;ref&gt;Huffman T. (1986) "Iron Age Settlements and Origins of Class Distinction in Southern Africa", Advances in World Archaeology, vol. 5, pp.291-338&lt;/ref&gt; This group moved to [[Mapungubwe]] where they used stone walls to separate the ruling class from the rest of the population. This settlement was abandoned in the thirteenth century at around the time that a now much better-known site was developed by others who lived on the Zimbabwean plateau. This was [[Great Zimbabwe]], which dates from about 1250–1500 AD. It is a stone-walled town (''Zimbabwe'' means "royal residence") and shows evidence in its archaeology of skilled stone working: the walls were made of a local granite and no mortar was used in their construction.&lt;ref&gt;Needham D.E., Mashingaidze E.K, Bhebe N. (1984) "From Iron Age to Independence, A History of Central Africa", p17. Longman, England. {{ISBN|0582651115}}&lt;/ref&gt; When excavated, [[Zimbabwe bird|six soapstone birds]] and a [[soapstone]] bowl were found in the eastern enclosure of the monument, so these [[Shona language|Shona-speaking]] Gumanye people certainly produced sculpture. Each object was carved from a single piece of stone and the birds have an aesthetic quality that places them as genuine "art". In comparing them to other better-known African stone sculpture, for example from the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba culture]], Philip Allison, writing in 1968, stated "The stone sculptures of Rhodesia are few in number and of no great aesthetic distinction, but Zimbabwe itself has a place of peculiar importance in the study of African cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Allison P., (1968) "African Stone Sculpture", p54. Lund Humphries, Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone Age===
In prehistory the area was widely settled by Kung peoples, the so-called [[Khoikhoi]] or San, Hottentot or Bushmen people, who were [[hunter gatherer]]s. They often lived in [[caves]] and made various artworks, including beading from shells for personal decoration, incising designs on [[ostrich]] shells and utilitarian objects such as clay water straws and also on the cave walls themselves. These dynamic and varied [[cave paintings]] date from around 10000 BCE and depict humans hunting many kinds of animals, warfare between humans, mystical and other unidentified marks, landscape and ceremonies where the humans are obviously decorated or in costume. The colours vary from black through brown, red, [[ochre]], yellow and white. The pigments used are unknown, though presumably contain a mix of local materials such as earth [[oxides]], fat, vegetable juices and possibly fluids from [[larva]]l insects. Certainly they have lasted for thousands of years.

Their descendants, who live mainly in Botswana and Namibia, sing a variety of uniquely structured and tuneful songs, accompanied sometimes by a plucked or struck bow. They also have a repertoire of dances, and there is no reason to suspect their ancestors did not do the same thing.

===Iron Age===
These Stone Age people were supplanted by Iron Age [[Nguni people|Nguni]]-derived pastoral and farming peoples migrating in from the east and north around 2000 years ago, who became the ancestors of the [[Rozwi Empire|WaRozwi]]/Barotse people and by derivation the [[Amashona]] peoples. The art of these people can be seen in many decorated first-fired clay pots, where typically a repeated dhlo-dhlo (linear [[herringbone pattern|herringbone]]) [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] or similar edging was applied. Other artwork is harder to source, though it can assumed they decorated the body and had [[beadwork]] and other art styles related to typical styles of the East and Central African Nguni peoples. A recurrent motif in Shona art is the transformation of a human into an animal of some kind.

===Later prehistory===
At around the same time as the earlier incursions of these Bantu-type people (200BCE) there were sporadic expeditions by South-East coastal dwellers, probably by the Savi/Save river or over the Inyanga/[[Chimanimani]] mountain passes, into the Zimbabwe area to obtain [[gold]] for trade with [[Arab]] traders trading as far south as the mouth of the Savi. They built stone forts extending into the interior at one day's march from each other, with the final one being the complex now known as [[Great Zimbabwe]]. To service the coastal trade a town called [[Sofala]] was established at the  mouth of the Sofala river on the east coast. It had its heydey in around 700 AD/CE and served the [[Mwenemutapa]]/[[Monomotapa]] Kingdom, whose capital was [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Arabs took up residence in Sofala around 900AD/CE.

===Early sculpture===
Archaeology at Zimbabwe has shown several distinct phases of building and styles of stonework. It is likely the original complex was rather functional - essentially a [[fort]] and trading post only, and the later and more elaborate building occurred when the complex became the central administrative and royal centre of activity for the area. Some of the architectural features are probably linked with styles of coastal [[Swahili architecture]] and some are uniquely local. [[Chinese pottery]] shards, ivory, glass objects, local gold objects, Arabic and local beads, [[copper ingot]]s, [[iron]] ingots and other trade items have been found at Zimbabwe. The herringbone and other stepped linear forms of decoration in the walls are a feature of the most recent stonework. Similar stonework is seen at [[Khami]] ruins, a fort built on the way to Zimbabwe. However, the most impressive and unique feature of Zimbabwe are the huge [[soapstone birds]], the so-called [[Zimbabwe bird]]s, depicting a [[bird of prey]] perched on a zig-zag base motif. These birds are possibly based on the [[bateleur eagle]] or maybe a [[vulture]] species and might have had something to do with a [[Cult|religious cult]] or indicative of a [[totem]] animal for the ruling people at the time. Most of these sculptures are still in the country but one is in South Africa where it still adorns [[Groote Schuur]] an official residence, once the home of Cecil Rhodes. Another unexplained motif at Zimbabwe, which like the birds were mounted on the perimeter wall of the Great Enclosure, were stelae or tall narrow rectilinear pillars of rock (probably natural fracture artefacts) set at intervals round the top of the wall. The Zimbabwe bird is the most prominent motif of the current [[Zimbabwe flag]].

===Amandebele incursions===
The origin of [[Amandebele]] speaking peoples in southern Zimbabwe received its main impetus from settlement around 1840 under Mzilikazi, a Khumalo chief who rebelled against Zulu rule. However, it is likely that such tribes began crossing the Limpopo sporadically from about 1800 onwards. Amandebele conflict with the Amashona drove them northwards into what was dubbed in colonial times Mashonaland. These [[Amandebele]]/[[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] peoples had several distinct art forms differing from the Amashona: in pottery styles, bead aprons and headpieces, house decoration, carving and decoration of war implements such as clubs/[[knobkierrie]]s and shields.

===19th and early 20th century===
Art in Zimbabwe lost most of its spiritual power with the conversion of the majority of the population to Christianity in the 19th and 20th centuries. Missionaries harmed the local cultures by demanding destruction of anything they regarded as anti-Christian, in particular masks or carvings thought to have votive powers, that is, to be appealing to some god that was not the Christian one. By the second world war most art objects produced in Zimbabwe were simply that: produced for tourist and local white settler consumption. With the advent of guns, animal skins prepared and decorated with small panels of other hides also began to appear more frequently in the early 20th century, as well as '[[kaross]]es' or fur blankets influenced by BaTchwana styles from Botswana to the south.

As for travelers to the area during the [[Victorian period]], they used art, especially painting, to depict some of what they saw there. This art of the [[colony|colonial period]] took landscape as its main theme and many of the European artists were present as part of expeditions that aimed to inform the public in Europe about life in Africa. For example, [[Thomas Baines]] joined the [[Zambezi]] expedition led by [[David Livingstone]] in 1858 and in 1861 he was one of the first to make oil paintings of [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]]. [[John Guille Millais]] spent six months of 1893 sketching and hunting in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=CWI9&gt;Winter-Irving C. (1991) "Visual Arts since the Nineteenth Century", Chapter 9 in "Stone Sculpture in Zimbabwe", Roblaw Publishers, [[Harare]], {{ISBN|0908309147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s a Zimbabwe philanthropist named [[Jairos Jiri]] began to teach disabled people various artistic skills and centralised their production for sale in several outlets nationwide. These proved very popular and returned money to persons otherwise excluded from normal commercial activity. Jairos Jiri centres remain an important part of the artistic output in Zimbabwe. Typical items include tiles, tiled tables and wall plaques, basketwork, beading, carvings in wood and stone, jewellery and paintings.

===Prelude to independence===
In the mid-1970s the nationalist guerilla incursions resulted in several atrocities against people in rural villages, including the sawing off of the upper lip of those perceived as collaborating with the government forces. The white government collated photographic images and a text list of these events into a propaganda booklet called 'Anatomy of Terror'. This was designed to show the brutality of the nationalists against innocent rural native people. Images from this publication are today to be found on [[YouTube]] (for example under 'Terrorists in the Rhodesian bush').

Other art from the white minority during the civil "Rhodesian Bush" (1968 - 1979) war consisted mainly of depictions of indigenous fauna and flora and landscapes. These subjects had always been popular and remain popular to this day among white artists. No individual white artist expressed any significant political sentiment during the civil war era. However, many film, still and sound clips celebrating the government forces' role during this time are currently available on YouTube.

===Painting in the 20th century===
While there were many well-known white artists in Rhodesia prior to independence in 1980, there were relatively few black artists of note. One of these was [[Kingsley Sambo]] (1932–1977), who started to paint at the [[Cyrene Mission]] where Canon Edward Paterson taught art. Two of Sambo’s paintings are in the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York|MoMA]]. Others were [[Thomas Mukarobgwa]] (also a leading sculptor) and [[Joseph Ndandarika]] &lt;ref&gt;Zilberg J. (2006) [http://www.nationalgallery.co.zw/PDFs/Kinglsey%20Sambo%20and%20Vincent%20Van%20Gogh.pdf]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} National Gallery archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Workshop School of the National Gallery supported and encouraged painters from 1957, Rhodesia had few Colleges for Fine Arts. The Bulawayo College of Fine Art and Design trained artists in fine art and graphic design for Rhodesian industry and it was not until 1963 that Alex Lambert set up the [[Mzilikazi Art School]] in [[Bulawayo]] specifically to encourage local people to take up art.

The [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]] has, since 1986, promoted local artists by hosting an annual exhibition of contemporary visual arts called "Zimbabwe Heritage". Patronage from Zimbabwean companies – the Baringa Corporation (for paintings, graphics, textiles, ceramics and photograph) and the Nedlaw Investment and Trust Corporation (for sculpture) – initially supported the expense of having an international panel of judges come to Zimbabwe to assess the works and make Awards. Later, the sponsorship of the event grew to include international companies such as [[Mobil]], [[Lever Brothers]], [[The BOC Group]] and [[Longman]]. Early winners of Awards of Distinction in the painters and graphics category included Berry Bickle (1987), Bert Hemsteede (1988), Rashid Jogee (1992) and Tichaona Madzamba (1992).&lt;ref name=NGZ&gt;See annual catalogues for ''Zimbabwe Heritage'', produced by the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Painters who have established reputations in post-independence Zimbabwe include [[Dumisani Ngwenya]], [[Taylor Nkomo]] and [[Richard Jack]].&lt;ref name=CWI9/&gt;

[[Chapungu Sculpture Park]] in [[Harare]] is currently an important locality for display of (mainly) Shona sculptors and carvers. Another [http://www.chapungusculpturepark.com Chapungu Sculpture Park] was created in 2007 in the United States, along with a gallery, in Loveland, Colorado. ''[[Zimbabwe Sculpture: a Tradition in Stone]]'' is on permanent display at [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta's airport]].

Since antiquity local artists have been using the steatite/[[soapstone]] deposits of the eastern Zimbabwe mountain ranges to produce artworks showing, among other things, the common Shona theme of animal/human inter-morphosis. These works became much larger under the patronage of white collectors in the 1960s (though the Zimbabwe birds of antiquity are massive) and now it is common to see monumental soapstone sculptures both nationally and internationally.

Noted Zimbabwean artists include sculptor [[Patrick Mavros]], and painters [[Kim Donaldson]], [[Larry Norton]], [[Brennan Seward]], [[Kefas Gimo]], [[Eric Forlee]] and [[Owen Maseko]].

Villa Mangiacane in Tuscany hosts one of the largest modern collections of Shona Art sculptures in Europe with over 220 pieces on display across the Estate.
