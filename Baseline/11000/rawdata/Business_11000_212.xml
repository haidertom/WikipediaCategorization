The '''Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association''' ('''AAEA''') is a professional association for those interested in the field of [[Agricultural economics|agricultural]] and [[applied economics]].

Established in 1910, AAEA currently has more than 2,500 members in more than 20 countries. Members of AAEA work in academic or government institutions as well as in industry and not-for-profit organizations, and engage in a variety of research, teaching, and outreach activities in the areas of agriculture, the environment, food, health, and international development.

==Publications ==
AAEA is responsible for two journals, the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' (''AJAE''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaea.org/publications/ajae/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421220540/http://www.aaea.org/publications/ajae/ |archive-date=2009-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]]'' (''AEPP''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaea.org/publications/aepp/|title=AEPP - Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association|website=Aaea.org|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are published by [[Oxford University Press]]. The association also publishes two [[outreach]] publications, an online policy magazine called [[Choices Magazine|''Choices'']] and a bi-monthly newsletter for its members called ''The Exchange''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaea.org/publications/exchange/|title=The Exchange - Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association|website=Aaea.org|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AAEA was founded in 1910 as the American Farm Management Association. In 1919, it merged with the American Association of Agricultural Economists to form the American Farm Economic Association (AFEA). The ''Journal of Farm Economics'' was first published in 1919 as well.

In 1968, the AFEA changed its name to the American Agricultural Economics Association (AAEA), at which point its journal became the ''American Journal of Agricultural Economics''. Finally, in 2008, AAEA changed its name to the Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association, in order to more accurately describe its membership and the broadening focus of the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaea.org/UserFiles/file/Association_Name_Change.pdf|format=PDF|title=We are pleased to announce that effective August 1, 2008, that is directly after the 2008 Joint Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida, our Association name will be changed to the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association (AAEA)|website=Aaea.org|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John K. Galbraith Forum and Award==
The '''John Kenneth Galbraith Forum and Award''' is awarded annually. This prestigious honor goes to a distinguished professional for continuing Galbraith's tradition of outstanding research and major social contributions. The Galbraith Award winner is also a plenary speaker at the AAEA Annual Meeting.

John Kenneth Galbraith was born October 15, 1908. He received his Ph.D. in agricultural economics from the University of California, Berkeley. After graduation, he taught at Berkeley and the University of California, Davis. Galbraith then moved to the East Coast and had a long and distinguished career teaching economics at Harvard and Princeton Universities. He has played an important public service and policy role. During World War II Galbraith administered price controls for the United States. He was an adviser to multiple U.S. Presidents and served as U.S. Ambassador to India under President John F. Kennedy. Galbraith also served as the editor of ''Fortune Magazine'' from 1943-1948, and a wrote several books including ''American Capitalism'' (1951) and ''The Affluent Society'' (1958). He holds the Medal of Freedom and the Order of Canada.

The Forum was created in 2003 as an honor to Galbraith. Agricultural and applied economists from around the world gathered at the 2003 AAEA annual meeting in Montreal, Canada, to witness the birth of the John Kenneth Galbraith Forum and Award. The Galbraith Fund was established within the AAEA Trust by private donors. The Galbraith Forum and Award Committee selects the recipient of the Award each year.  The committee has six members appointed to a three-year rotating term, with two new members each year. Five Galbraith Award Honorees are Nobel Laureates.

'''Alfredo Fortabat''' (1894 &amp;ndash; January 19, 1976) was a prominent Argentine industrialist.

==Life and times==
Alfredo Fortabat was born in [[Azul, Buenos Aires|Azul]], a small city in [[Buenos Aires Province]], in 1894; his parents, Helene Pourtal and Lucien Fortabat, were recently arrived [[French Argentine]]s. Lucien Fortabat was named Director of Azul's important French language school and later Director of the ''Banco Comercial'', which enabled his son, Alfredo, to attend the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. The elder Fortabat died in 1921, however, and upon Alfredo's return in 1924, local [[cement kiln]] owners encouraged him to invest in the growing industry.&lt;ref name=rn&gt;[http://www.rionegro.com.ar/suple_economico/05-04-30/nota2.php ''Río Negro'': La trama de la venta del grupo Fortabat {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1926 discovery of large [[limestone]] deposits at the San Jacinto Estancia inherited from his father led Fortabat to open a cement factory in the nearby [[pampas]] hamlet of Loma Negra (south of [[Olavarría]]); the choice of location prompted him to christen the company ''[[Loma Negra]]'' (''"Black Mound"''). The cement plant was built in 1927, and Fortabat protected his venture in its early years partly by buying voting shares in competitors' boards.&lt;ref name=rn/&gt;&lt;ref name=loma&gt;[http://www.lomanegra.com.ar/index_loma.htm Loma Negra: historia {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801052352/http://www.lomanegra.com.ar/index_loma.htm |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortabat, whose marriage to Magdalena Corti Maderna ended in divorce, met a young [[Buenos Aires]] heiress, [[María Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat|Amalia Lacroze]], during a 1941 [[Teatro Colón]] function, and the two began a relationship. Planning to wed, they were impeded by Argentina's then-conservative nuptial laws, which precluded separated couples from remarrying.  The marriage, which ultimately took place in neighboring [[Uruguay]], became recognized in Argentina following a reform signed into law by President [[Juan Perón]], in 1951. Mrs. Fortabat's gregariousness and knowledge of four foreign languages helped create a close business partnership as well as marriage, though it later suffered from a number of publicly reported infidelities.&lt;ref name=actual&gt;[http://www.articlearchives.com/south-america/argentina-buenos-aires-argentina/447105-1.html Colín, Julia. "Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat." ''Actual'' (6/1/1999) {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612050224/http://www.articlearchives.com/south-america/argentina-buenos-aires-argentina/447105-1.html |date=2009-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loma Negra grew alongside the [[Argentine economy]]; by the early 1950s, the company produced 500,000 tons of cement annually and accounted for 70% of the cement sold to the Ministry of Public Works, for instance (his prominence as a building materials supplier during the Perón years triggered investigations against Loma Negra following the populist leader's 1955 overthrow, though charges were later dropped).&lt;ref name=rn/&gt; New facilities in the [[Andes]]-range cities of [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]] and [[Zapala]], opened during the 1960s, made Loma Negra the leader in cement and concrete production nationally.&lt;ref name=loma/&gt; 

The industrialist invested generously in employee housing and in 1930, established a largely self-contained community adjacent the cement works ("Villa Alfredo Fortabat").&lt;ref name=loma/&gt; The proprietor of 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres) of prime [[pampas]] land in his later years, he established the charitable Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat Foundation, in 1971.&lt;ref name=rn/&gt;

Alfredo Fortabat died in Buenos Aires on January 19, 1976, upon which his widow became the President and nearly sole owner of [[Loma Negra]].

He showed a strong interest in the performing arts and formed part of the ARA Theatre-School run by Ángeles Rubio-Argüelles y Alessandri (wife of diplomat, writer and film director [[Edgar Neville]]) and the College of Dramatic Art, both in [[Málaga]]. His work in the theater, and his performances on the streets, eventually landed him a spot with the Spanish National Theatre.&lt;ref name="starpulsebio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Banderas,_Antonio/Biography/ |title=Antonio Banderas Biography |publisher=StarPulse.com |accessdate=8 June 2011 |archivedate=22 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222162026/http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Banderas%2C_Antonio/Biography/ |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early work, 1982–1990 ===
Banderas began working in small shops during [[Spain]]'s post-dictatorial cultural movement known as the [[La Movida Madrileña]].&lt;ref name="lovestory" /&gt; While performing with the theatre, Banderas caught the attention of Spanish director [[Pedro Almodóvar]], who cast the young actor in his 1982 movie debut ''[[Labyrinth of Passion]]''. Five years later, he went on to appear in the director's ''[[Law of Desire]]'', making headlines with his performance as a [[gay]] man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. After Banderas appeared in Almodóvar's 1986 ''[[Matador (film)|Matador]]'', the director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film, ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''. The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased two years later when he starred in Almodóvar's controversial ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' as a [[mental patient]] who kidnaps a porn star ([[Victoria Abril]]) and keeps her tied up until she returns his love.&lt;ref name="starpulsebio" /&gt; It was his breakthrough role in ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'', that helped spur him on to [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="doctorate" /&gt; Almodóvar is credited for helping launch Banderas's international career, as he became a regular feature in his movies throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

=== Breakthrough, 1991–1994 ===

In 1991, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] introduced Banderas to [[Hollywood]]. The following year, still speaking minimal [[English language|English]], he began acting in U.S. films. Despite having to learn all his lines [[phonetically]], Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film, ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Mambo Kings Review by Roger Ebert"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-mambo-kings-1992 | title=The Mambo Kings Review by Roger Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the film ''[[Philadelphia (movie)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993), as the lover of lawyer Andrew Beckett ([[Tom Hanks]]), who has AIDS. The film's success earned Banderas wide recognition, and the following year he was given a role in [[Neil Jordan]]'s high-profile [[Interview with the Vampire (film)|adaptation]] of [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'', sharing the screen with [[Brad Pitt]].&lt;ref name="starpulsebio" /&gt;

=== Worldwide recognition, 1995–present ===
He appeared in several major Hollywood releases in [[1995 in film|1995]], including a starring role in the [[Robert Rodriguez]]-directed film ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and the antagonist on the action film ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'', co-starred with [[Sylvester Stallone]]. In 1996, he starred alongside [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', an adaptation of the musical by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] in which he played the narrator, Che, a role played by [[David Essex]] in the original 1978 West End production. He also made success with his role as the legendary masked swordsman [[Zorro]] in the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]''. In 1999 he starred in ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', a movie about a [[Muslim]] caught up in a war between the [[Norsemen|Northman]] and human eating beasts.

In 2001, he collaborated with [[Robert Rodriguez]] who cast him in the ''[[Spy Kids trilogy|Spy Kids]]'' film trilogy. He also starred in [[Michael Cristofer]]'s ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]'' alongside [[Angelina Jolie]] the same year. In 2002, he starred in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' opposite [[Rebecca Romijn]] and in [[Julie Taymor]]'s ''[[Frida]]'' with [[Salma Hayek]]. In 2003, he starred in the last installment of the trilogy ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' (in which he appeared with [[Johnny Depp]] and Hayek). Banderas' debut as a director was the poorly received ''[[Crazy in Alabama]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]]), starring his then wife [[Melanie Griffith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/melaniegriffith.htm|title=The History of Prenuptial Agreements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antonio Banderas June07.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Banderas in June 2007]]

In 2003, he returned to the musical genre, appearing to great acclaim in the Broadway revival of [[Maury Yeston]]'s musical ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'', based on the film ''[[8½]]'', playing the prime role originated by [[Raúl Juliá]]. Banderas won both the Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk awards, and was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] for best actor in a musical.&lt;ref name="broadway"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Press International|work=Banderas set for Broadway return|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060404-034720-1455r|accessdate=6 April 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506115932/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060404-034720-1455r |archivedate=6 May 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance is preserved on the Broadway cast recording released by [[PS Classics]]. Later that year, he received the [[Rita Moreno]] HOLA Award for Excellence from the [[Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors]] (HOLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellohola.org/photo_awards_2003.php|title=HOLA Awards 2003|publisher=Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banderas' voice role as [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', and the last film in the Shrek franchise, ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', helped make the [[Character (arts)|character]] popular on the family film circuit. In 2005, he reprised his role as [[Zorro]] in ''[[The Legend of Zorro]]'', though this was not as successful as ''The Mask of Zorro''. In 2006, he starred in ''[[Take the Lead]]'', a high-set movie in which he played a [[ballroom dancing]] teacher. That year, he directed his second film ''[[Summer Rain (2006 film)|El camino de los ingleses]]'', and also received the L.A. Latino International Film Festival's "Gabi" Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117952390.html?categoryid=38&amp;cs=1|work=Variety|title=Banderas flies flag at LALIFF|date=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 6801 Hollywood Blvd. in 2005.

In 2011, the horror thriller ''[[The Skin I Live In]]'' marked the return of Banderas to [[Pedro Almodóvar]], the Spanish director who launched his international career. The two had not worked together since 1990 (''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]''). In ''The Skin I Live In'' he breaks out of the "[[Latin lover (stereotype)|Latin Lover]]" mold from his Hollywood work and stars as a calculating revenge-seeking plastic surgeon following the rape of his daughter. According to the [[Associated Press]] Banderas' performance is among his strongest in recent memory.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jJinOIb9WP4KNqqGcTaWTFnhYG8w?docId=7f441b478ffa4a558992fe52e158b8f0|title=Spain's Almodovar eyes English-language project|last=Barchfield|first=Jenny|date=21 May 2011|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again lent his voice to Puss in Boots, this time as the [[protagonist]] of the ''Shrek'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]], ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]''. This film reunited Banderas with [[Salma Hayek]] for the sixth time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2011/05/extra_raw_salma_hayek_and_anto.php|title=Extra' Raw: Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas in Cannes|date=12 May 2011|publisher=[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Banderas appeared among other figures of Spanish culture in a video supporting the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] lists in the [[Spanish general election, 1996|general election]].

A longtime supporter of [[Málaga CF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,221,00.html |title= Cigar Aficionado {{!}} People Profile {{!}} Antonio Banderas |access-date= 13 August 2012 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/69yiuZO3Q?url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/Behind-the-Mask_6197 |archive-date= 17 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; he is also an officer (mayordomo de trono) of a Roman Catholic religious brotherhood in [[Málaga]] and travels during [[Holy Week]] to take part [[Holy Week in Málaga|in the processions]],&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;''[http://www.abc.es/20100329/gente-famosos/antonio-banderas-semana-santa-201003291143.html Antonio Banderas, en la Semana Santa malagueña]'', ''ABC'', 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; although in an interview with ''People'' magazine, Banderas had once described himself as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio Banderas Puts on His Dancing Shoes|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1181281,00.html|work=People|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Banderas went under surgery for a benign tumor in his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio Banderas: ho avuto un tumore alla schiena|url=https://www.ok-salute.it/benessere/antonio-banderas-ho-avuto-un-tumore-alla-schiena|date=24 February 2014|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banderas has always struggled with the pronunciation of certain [[English language|English]] words, as he mentioned in a 2011 article with [[GQ]] Magazine. "The word that really gets me is animals, I just can never say it properly, whenever it is in a film I have to get it changed for a synonym." "In Zorro, I had a line changed from 'You look like a bunch of animals' to 'you look like a collection of beasts' it worked much better, so I don't care".&lt;ref name="The Local" /&gt;

In 2013, he called on Europe and the United States to emulate [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela and nationalize big corporations as a solution to the [[Great Recession|global economic crisis]].&lt;ref name="The Local"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.es/20131120/chvez-ideas-wil-solve-crisis-antonio-banderas|title='Chávez ideas will solve crisis': Antonio Banderas|date=20 November 2013|work=The Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asia Market Wrap''''' is a [[business]] [[news]] programme aired on [[CNBC Asia]] between
1600-1800 ([[Hong Kong]]/[[Singapore]]/[[Taiwan]] time, until December 2005. The show also aired on [[CNBC US]] on 5:30 to 6AM ET until 2000, then it was moved to [[CNBC World]]. Anchored by [[Christine Tan]], ''Asia Market Wrap'' examined the day's headlines and numbers, with in-depth analysis of the day's financial news, interviewing key money managers, market experts and corporate chiefs.

The programme, comes from its original edition on CNBC US, '''''[[Market Wrap]]''''', included several segments, such as ''Australia Market Wrap'', ''China Business Briefing'' and ''Eye on India''. '''''[[Asia Market Week]]''''' - a weekly wrap-up of the market action in Asia - aired between 17:30-18:00 on Fridays.

Prior to [[Martin Soong]]'s original departure from CNBC Asia, he was the programme's regular presenter (the programme was billed as ''Asia Market Wrap with Martin Soong''). When he returned to present '''''[[Asia Squawk Box]]''''', Tan was moved to present ''Asia Market Wrap'' instead.

The programme was not aired on CNBC Asia's [[CNBC Australia]], local opt-out - it was replaced by [[CNBC Europe|CNBC Europe's]] ''[[Morning Exchange (CNBC Europe)|Morning Exchange]]'' (1600 - 1700 HK/SG Time) and [[CNBC|CNBC's]] '''''[[Wake Up Call (CNBC)|Wake Up Call]]''''' (1700 - 1800 HK/SG/TWN Time).

The programme ended on 2 December 2005 and was replaced by '''''[[Worldwide Exchange]]''''' on 19 December 2005. Tan continues as the Asian presenter of this programme, joined by CNBC's [[Michelle Caruso-Cabrera]] (used for 2005-07-10-19 to due General assignment), now anchored by [[Brian Shactman]]  (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's [[Ross Westgate]].

The company is headquartered in [[Chiasso]], [[Switzerland]], where it was founded in 1994, and Boston (MA).&lt;ref name="Nucleus"&gt;{{cite web|title='Research Note: Benefits of BOARD International'|url=http://nucleusresearch.com/research/notes-and-reports/benefits-of-board-international/|publisher=Nucleus Research|format=PDF|accessdate=Oct 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While its core markets are still located in Europe, BOARD International has been expanding globally and now operates in 15 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name="MQBI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-196WFCB&amp;ct=120207&amp;st=sb |title=Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence Platforms |first=John |last=Hagerty |last2=Sallam |first2=Rita L. |last3=Richardson |first3=James |publisher=Gartner |date=Feb 6, 2012 |accessdate=Oct 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loc"&gt;{{cite web|title='World Wide Locations' |url=http://www.board.com/in/company-6/board-international/world-wide-locations |publisher=BOARD International |accessdate=Apr 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175239/http://www.board.com/in/company-6/board-international/world-wide-locations |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a total of over 2,500 customers from a number of different industries,&lt;ref name="Nucleus"/&gt; including large international corporations such as [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Best Western]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[NEC]], and [[Puma SE|Puma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BOARD - Reference' |url=http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/clients |publisher=BOARD International |accessdate=Oct 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027040512/http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/clients |archivedate=2012-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

BOARD International offers only one product, the '''BOARD toolkit'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BOARD - All In One' |url=http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/allinone |publisher=BOARD International |accessdate=Oct 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006073642/http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/allinone |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It combines various [[Business Intelligence|BI]] and [[Corporate Performance Management|CPM]] functionalities within a single graphical software environment.&lt;ref name="MQBI"/&gt; BOARD's BI capabilities include multi-dimensional analysis, ''ad hoc'' querying, dashboarding and reporting, while its CPM capabilities include budgeting, planning and forecasting as well as "other finance-related activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Gleansight - Agile Business Intelligence - Q4 2012'|first=Jeff |last=Zabin |authorlink=Jeff Zabin|last2=O'Brien |first2=Tim |last3=Forgash |first3=Amanda|url=http://www.gleanster.com/reports/reports/agile-business-intelligence#.UIZUOMUxoWb|publisher=Gleanster|format=PDF|accessdate=Oct 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Business Intelligence software]] in general, BOARD is used in an effort to improve productivity and decision making while lowering costs.&lt;ref name="Nucleus"/&gt; It does not require any [[Computer programming|programming]] skills to build BI and CPM applications.&lt;ref name="MQBI"/&gt;

=== Technology ===

As of version 7, the BOARD toolkit features a [[service-oriented architecture]] that relies heavily on [[Microsoft]] technology, especially the [[.NET Framework]] with its [[Windows Communication Foundation]]. This allows for a tight integration with other Microsoft products, such as [[Microsoft Office]], but requires [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] in order to run the full client, a limitation which has been identified by [[Gartner]] as a possible factor for preventing a deeper market penetration.&lt;ref name="MQBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture"&gt;{{cite web|title='BOARD - Architecture' |url=http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/architecture/IN-Overview |publisher=BOARD International |accessdate=Oct 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904131507/http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/architecture/IN-Overview |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BOARD - Architecture: Office Integration' |url=http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/architecture/IN-officeintegration |publisher=BOARD International |accessdate=Oct 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213093835/http://www.board.com/business-intelligence-software/architecture/IN-officeintegration |archivedate=2012-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MQCPM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boardargentina.com/board-blog/archives/GartnerMagicQuadrant2012forCorporatePerformanceManagementSuites.pdf |title=Magic Quadrant for Corporate Performance Management Suites |format=PDF |first=John E. |last=Van Decker |last2=Chandler |first2=Neil |last3=Iervolino |first3=Christopher |publisher=Gartner |date=Mar 19, 2012 |accessdate=Oct 22, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BOARD International Releases BOARD 7 - BeyeNetwork'|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/10258|accessdate=Oct 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the company introduced an update of its proprietary [[multidimensional database]] that BOARD is based on. This new technology was labelled as ''HBMP (Hybrid Bitwise Memory Pattern)''. It introduced a new compression method and combines disk-based and [[In-memory database|in-memory]] database approaches. It supports both [[Relational database|relational]] and [[Multidimensional database|multidimensional]] data models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BOARD - Toolkit' |url=http://www.board.com/business-intelligence/HBMP |publisher=BOARD International |accessdate=Oct 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910183312/http://www.board.com/business-intelligence/HBMP |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='HBMP: The New Frontier of In-Memory Business Intelligence and CPM -- TDWI -The Data Warehousing Institute'|url=http://tdwi.org/whitepapers/2012/04/hbmp-the-new-frontier-of-in-memory-business-intelligence-and-cpm.aspx|publisher=TDWI|accessdate=Oct 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage ===

According to ''The BI Survey 12'', a worldwide [[Business Intelligence|BI]] and [[Corporate Performance Management|CPM]] user survey, the most widely used application areas of BOARD are [[financial reporting|reporting]], ad-hoc querying, [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboarding]], budgeting &amp; planning, [[OLAP]] analysis, visual analysis &amp; data discovery, [[Predictive analytics|predictive analysis]] &amp; [[data mining]] and [[Consolidation (business)|financial consolidation]] (in descending order of use frequency).&lt;ref name="BIS12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.board.com/business-intelligence/RegDownload?OpenForm&amp;id=149FEC616C3E6E09C1257A94003FB76C&amp;img=BOARD_in_TheBISurvey12_Thumb.jpg |title=The BI Survey 12: BOARD in The BI Survey 12 |format=PDF |publisher=BARC |accessdate=Oct 26, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effectiveness ===

A 2012 case study by [[Nucleus Research]] analyzed the effectiveness of BOARD when used as a company-wide [[business analytics]] solution. The research was based on three years' worth of actual data from Marketing General, a BOARD customer. It came to the conclusion that the introduction of BOARD allowed Marketing General to "raise profits, reduce customer churn and increase organizational productivity" while producing an average annual benefit of $119,962. It was calculated that, on average, the system saved 6 working hours a week per manager and IT worker.&lt;ref name="ROI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nucleusresearch.com/research/roi-case-studies/roi-case-study-board-marketing-general/|title=ROI Case Study: Board |format=PDF |publisher=Nucleus Research |date=Oct 2012 |accessdate=Oct 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==

In recent years, BOARD has been frequently included in major publications on the [[Business Intelligence|BI]] and [[Corporate Performance Management|CPM]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/id=1578314|title=Magic Quadrant for Corporate Performance Management Suites |format=PDF |first2=John E. |last2=Van Decker |last=Chandler |first=Neil |publisher=Gartner |date=Mar 8, 2011 |accessdate=Oct 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/id=1531017|title=Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence Platforms |format=PDF |first3=John |last3=Hagerty |last=Sallam |first=Rita L. |last2=Richardson |first2=James |last4=Hostmann |first4=Bill |publisher=Gartner |date=Jan 27, 2011 |accessdate=Oct 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, it was included in The BI Survey 12, "the world's largest and most detailed annual survey of [[business intelligence software]] usage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The BI Survey 12 - Products covered'|url=http://www.bi-survey.com/index.php?id=118|publisher=BARC|accessdate=Oct 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The BI Survey 12 - A product overview'|url=http://www.bi-survey.com/index.php?id=35|publisher=BARC|accessdate=Oct 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BOARD also was featured in two of [[Gartner]]'s 2012 [[Gartner Magic Quadrant|Magic Quadrants]]: the ''Magic Quadrant for [[Business Intelligence]] Platforms''&lt;ref name="MQBI"/&gt; and the ''Magic Quadrant for [[Corporate Performance Management]] Suites''.&lt;ref name="MQCPM"/&gt; BOARD International was the only single-product vendor to be included in both quadrants that year.&lt;ref name="MQBI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MQCPM"/&gt;

In terms of technology, the introduction of the [[.NET Framework|.NET]]-based BOARD 7 earned the company a ''Microsoft. NET Swiss Innovation Award'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/switzerland/msdn/de/awards/tech_Gewinner10_de.aspx|title=Microsoft Switzerland Awards|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=Oct 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bjørn Erlend Dæhlie''' (born 19 June 1967) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[businessman]] and retired [[cross-country skiing|cross-country skier]]. In the years from 1992 to 1999, Dæhlie won the Nordic World Cup six times, finishing second in 1994 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/08/sports/plus-winter-sports-cross-country-norway-s-daehlie-clinches-world-cup.html |title= WINTER SPORTS -- CROSS-COUNTRY; Norway's Daehlie Clinches World Cup |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 8 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie won a total of 29 medals in the Olympics and World Championships in the period between 1991 and 1999, making Dæhlie the most successful male cross-country skier in history.

During his career, Dæhlie measured a [[Vo2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]] of 96 ml/kg/min.&lt;ref&gt;http://sport.aftenbladet.no/sport/sykkel/article250793.ece {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie's result was achieved out of season, and physiologist Erlend Hem who was responsible for the testing stated that he would not discount the possibility of the skier passing 100 ml/kg/min at his absolute peak.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In addition to being an athletic figurehead, Dæhlie is a cultural icon in Norway. Since retiring, Dæhlie has become a successful businessman in real estate and fashion. His real estate investments have produced a fortune of more than half a billion&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dn.no/dnaktiv/2018/08/09/1042/Langrenn/bjorn-daehlie-har-doblet-formuen-pa-fem-ar&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norwegian kroner|kroner]]. Dæhlie has been featured in [[advertising]] campaigns, he started a brand of signature ski apparel, and he co-hosted a [[television]] show called ''[[Gutta på tur]]''. Dæhlie also invented the [[Ski bindings#Cross country|Salomon Nordic System Pilot Bindings]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Elverum]], [[Norway]], Dæhlie later moved to [[Nannestad]], where he settled down. Dæhlie attributes much of his success in sports to his upbringing where he was active in [[hunting]], [[fishing]], [[hiking]], [[kayaking]], [[association football|football]] and of course, [[skiing]] from a very early age. For much of his childhood Dæhlie wanted to be a football player, but after being prompted by a coach, he tried Nordic skiing. Dæhlie did not have immediate success as a junior racer, but he consistently improved and eventually qualified for the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] World Cup competitions.

==Athletic career==
Bjørn Dæhlie was first on the Norwegian skiing team for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Canada. However, he did not participate in any races and was there to learn from more senior skiers. He later claimed these Olympics were the turning point for Norwegian skiing before their following period of success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/Det-har-gatt-helt-som-smurt-6534883.html {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the world cup in January 1989, finishing 11th on 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle in Kavgolovo. In December the same year, he won his first world cup race. He finished first on the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle, the first world cup race of the season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrk.no/sport/bjorn-daehlie-1.4759992 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1991]] in Val di Fiemme, Dæhlie won his first World Championship gold medal. He beat skiing legend [[Gunde Svan]] on the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle. The medal was unexpected, since Dæhlie was young and still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Aftenposten, 10 February 1991 (Norwegian newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt; It was Norway's first individual gold medal in the World Championships since [[Oddvar Brå]] won gold in the same race in Oslo in 1982. Dæhlie also skied the last leg on the winning 4x10 km relay team.

In 1992, Dæhlie's period of dominance started. He won the world cup overall for the first time, a feat he would accomplish five more times in the next seven years. In [[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]] Dæhlie won his first Olympic medals. He won gold in 10/15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle pursuit, 50&amp;nbsp;km freestyle and was on the winning team for the 4x10 km relay. He won a silver in 30&amp;nbsp;km classical style. Dæhlie also finished fourth on the 10&amp;nbsp;km freestyle, where his teammate [[Vegard Ulvang]] won the gold. Dæhlie completed the 4th leg of the relay, and crossed the finishing line backwards, having won by a margin of over one and a half minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/sports/winter-olympics-italians-silence-norsemen-in-relay.html |title= WINTER OLYMPICS; Italians Silence Norsemen In Relay |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 23 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie and Ulvang completed a clean sweep of the cross-country skiing gold medals, each winning three golds and a silver. Dæhlie was awarded Fearnley's Olympic Prize for his performance, a prize given to the best performing Norwegian athlete in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idrett.no/tema/utmerkelser/Sider/Fearnleysolympiske.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216162922/http://www.idrett.no/tema/utmerkelser/Sider/Fearnleysolympiske.aspx |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in Lillehammer, Norway, Dæhlie won gold in the 10&amp;nbsp;km classical style and the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle pursuit. He won silver in the 30&amp;nbsp;km freestyle, where he was beaten by [[Thomas Alsgaard]]. The 4x10 km relay was a very tight race between Norway and Italy. The Italians won the gold after [[Silvio Fauner]] beat Dæhlie on the sprint on the last leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-23/sports/sp-26005_1_cross-country-ski-racing |title= '94 Winter Lillehammer Olympics : Italians Sneak a Victory : Nordic skiing: The strong Norwegian team is overcome near the finish in the men's 40k cross-country relay |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 23 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Thomas Alsgaard took over the 4th leg on the Norwegian relay team with Dæhlie skiing the 3rd leg, since Alsgaard was the better sprinter.

The [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997|1997 Skiing World Championships]] were Dæhlie's most successful World Championships. In front of the home crowd in Trondheim he won a medal in every race, taking gold in the 10&amp;nbsp;km classical race, the 10+15&amp;nbsp;km combined pursuit and the 4x10 km relay. In addition he won a silver in the 30&amp;nbsp;km freestyle and bronze in the 50&amp;nbsp;km classical. Dæhlie said the championships were like "Lillehammer all over again" and that "For me, it's very special to compete in Norway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/events/1998/nagano/athletes/159.htm |title= Athlete profile: Bjorn Daehlie |publisher= [[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |date= 3 February 1998 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060505080646/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/events/1998/nagano/athletes/159.htm |archivedate= 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dæhlie won three golds and one silver in his last Olympics in [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano]]. He won the 10&amp;nbsp;km classical style, the 50&amp;nbsp;km freestyle and the 4x10 km skiing relay. In the 15&amp;nbsp;km freestyle pursuit, he got a silver medal having been beaten by Thomas Alsgaard on the sprint. Dæhlie won the 50&amp;nbsp;km freestyle ahead of [[Niklas Jonsson]] by only eight seconds. Both skiers collapsed on the finishing line, having given everything in pursuit of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.shinmai.co.jp/oly-eng/19980222/0003.htm |title= Daehlie wins 50-km cross country for 3rd Nagano gold |newspaper= The Shinano Mainichi Shimbun |date= 22 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie described the race as his hardest race ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/sports/olympics-still-burning-to-compete-daehlie-looks-to-2002-games.html |title= OLYMPICS; Still Burning To Compete, Daehlie Looks To 2002 Games |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 29 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dæhlie also formed a lasting friendship with [[Phillip Boit]], the Kenyan skier. Dæhlie waited for Boit on the finish line for 20 minutes following the 10&amp;nbsp;km race, saying Boit deserved encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/winter_olympics_98/cross_country_skiing/55856.stm&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip went on to name one of his children Dæhlie Boit.

Dæhlie was planning to compete in the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, but he was prevented from participating by a career-ending [[roller skiing]] accident in August 1999. The resulting back injury prevented Dæhlie from adding more medals to his collection. He retired from the sport in March 2001, having tried extensive rehabilitation and surgery to come back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2001/03/29/250122.html {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to retire shocked the nation of Norway, where Dæhlie was idolized for his great winning record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrk.no/sport/bjorn-daehlie-1.4759992 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dæhlie's eight Olympic titles are a record for the [[Winter Olympics]], as are his total of 12 Olympic medals (he also won four silver medals) which he amassed in three Olympics ([[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]], [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer]] and [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano]]). In addition to his achievements at the Olympics he had great success in the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships|World Championships]] where he won 17 medals of which 9 were gold medals. He was particularly successful in the [[Trondheim]] [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997|1997 World Championships]], where he earned medals in all five events. Despite his unanticipated early exit from the sport, Dæhlie is considered by many to be one of the greatest Winter Olympic athletes of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Athletes/All-Athletes/Athletes-DA-to-DM/-BJORN-DAEHLIE-/ |title= Björn Dæhlie |website= Olympic.org |publisher= [[International Olympic Committee]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213032540/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Athletes/All-Athletes/Athletes-DA-to-DM/-BJORN-DAEHLIE-/ |archivedate= 2010-12-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his illustrious career, Dæhlie never won a race at the [[Holmenkollen ski festival]], but he was still awarded the [[Holmenkollen medal]] in 1997 (shared with [[Bjarte Engen Vik]] and [[Stefania Belmondo]]).

He also supports non-profit organisations that work for causes such as [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/lifestyle/40092082.html |title= Tallying a Birkebeiner score card |newspaper= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date= 23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Dæhlie raced in the [[American Birkebeiner]] as a fundraiser for [[multiple sclerosis]]. Dæhlie competed in the classic race, which is 54&amp;nbsp;km long, finishing second in a [[photo finish]].

In 2011, Dæhlie won the downhill event in the [[Kicksled]] World Championships in [[Hurdal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article4027980.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216075714/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article4027980.ece |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }} {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2011, Dæhlie announced a comeback, stating his intention to participate in long distance races like [[Marcialonga]] and [[Vasaloppet]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/sport/Bjorn-Dahlie-gjor-comeback-5122729.html {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dæhlie also participated in [[long-distance running]] in his youth, representing [[Ullensaker/Kisa IL]]. He participated in the Nordic junior match versus Denmark/Iceland, Finland and Sweden in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.friidrett.no/link/b22b7a9d92634f8096eef2277a832f38.aspx|title=Landskamper Menn junior|last=Hauge|first=Willy|publisher=Akershus District of Athletics|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 October 2018|format=doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===''Gillette Cavalcade of Sports''===
The earliest incarnation of NBC's boxing telecasts could be traced back to 1944.  Although technically, an anthology program, the ''[[Gillette Cavalcade of Sports|Cavalcade of Sports]]'' was best known for Friday night boxing (from [[Madison Square Garden]]) on NBC from 1944 through 1960, and (after NBC decided against featuring boxing due to sensitivity over criminal allegations in the sport) then for several more years on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  When ''Cavalcade of Sports'' closed up shop on June 24, 1960 after a 14-year period, it marked the longest continuous run of any boxing program in television history.

====''Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena''====
Another boxing program called ''[[Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena]]'' aired on NBC during the same period (more specifically, from 1946–1948) as the ''Cavalcade of Sports''.

===''Sportsworld'' and partnership with Telemundo===
In 2003, NBC entered a [[joint venture]] with [[Telemundo]] and boxing promotional group Main Events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/everlast2304.php Everlast Will Sponsor NBC, Telemundo And Main Events Pro Boxing Television Series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325115026/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/everlast2304.php |date=March 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On three consecutive Saturday afternoons – May 3, 10 and 17 – NBC Sports and Telemundo provided live coverage from the same Main Events-promoted boxing event.  It marked the first time that NBC broadcast professional boxing since 1992, when ''[[Sportsworld (U.S. TV series)|Sportsworld]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/sports/sports-people-boxer-skips-bout.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NBC+SportsWorld&amp;st=nyt SPORTS PEOPLE; Boxer Skips Bout – November 7, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/13/sports/boxing-a-weapon-in-tv-rating-game.html?scp=2&amp;sq=NBC+SportsWorld&amp;st=nyt Boxing a Weapon In TV Rating Game – July 13, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/09/sports/tv-sports-nbc-plans-to-take-tougher-approach.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NBC+SportsWorld&amp;st=nyt TV SPORTS; NBC Plans to Take Tougher Approach – March 9, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; ended its run after 14 years.

The following year, NBC and Telemundo renewed their partnership with a series of five Saturday cards beginning April 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/4354886 Boxing returns to NBC with 5-fight series]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NBCSN's ''Fight Night''===
Beginning in 2006, when the [[NBCSN]] was known as Versus, they began airing matches from [[Bob Arum]]'s [[Top Rank]] group. [[Nick Charles (sportscaster)|Nick Charles]] was one of the announcers. In 2010, Versus broadcast the [[World Series of Boxing]].

NBCSN's ''Fight Night'' series premiered on January 21, 2012 from [[2300 Arena]] in Philadelphia with [[Kenny Rice]] and trainer [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] on the call and [[Chris Mannix]] of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' serving as reporter and researcher.

==Notable bouts on NBC==
On July 2, 1921, NBC's future owner [[RCA]] and its [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] based radio station [[WJY (Hoboken, New Jersey)|WJY]] presented live coverage of the [[Jack Dempsey]] vs. [[Georges Carpentier]] heavyweight title fight. In the first major sporting event to be broadcast to a regional audience, ringside announcer J. Andrew White called Dempsey's fourth-round knockout victory.

On June 1, 1939, NBC (or technically, WNBT, which would eventually becoming NBC's [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] affiliate, [[WNBC]]) became the first American television network to broadcast a boxing match. Emanating from Yankee Stadium in New York City, Bill Stern provided the blow-by-blow commentary for the fight between [[Lou Nova]] and [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]]. 

On the premiere episode of ''[[Gillette_Cavalcade_of_Sports#As_Cavalcade_of_Sports|Cavalcade of Sports]]'' (airing on September 29, 1944), NBC broadcast a 15-round bout between [[Willie Pep]] and [[Chalky Wright]].

On June 19, 1946, at Yankee Stadium, [[Joe Louis]] defeated [[Billy Conn]] in the first [[television|televised]] World Heavyweight Championship bout ever. 146,000 people watched it on TV, also setting a record for the most seen world heavyweight bout in history. One year later on NBC on December 5, Joe Louis defeated [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] to retain the world heavyweight title.

On February 14, 1951, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] defeated [[Jake LaMotta]] in 13 rounds for the world middleweight title.

On the March 26, 1954 edition of ''Gillette Cavalcade of Sports'' from New York City's [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], Al Andrews and [[Gustav Scholz]] fought in NBC's first [[Color television|color]] transmission of a sporting event.

On the July 14, 1979 edition of ''[[Sportsworld (U.S. TV series)|NBC SportsWorld]]'', NBC aired an eight round long exhibition match from [[Denver]]'s [[Mile High Stadium]] between former [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]] defensive lineman [[Lyle Alzado]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]. [[Sam Nover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Ali Boxing vs Football and Lyle Alzado МУХАММЕД АЛИ|id=iWBbVFUVulk}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the blow-by-blow commentary with [[Dick Schaap]] reporting. Two years later on June 25, ''NBC SportsWorld'' aired [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]'s victory in the ninth round against [[Ayub Kalule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Sugar Ray Leonard vs Ayub Kalule|id=bbas0GWb5io}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List_of_WBA_world_champions#Super_welterweight|World Light Middleweight champion]]. [[Marv Albert]] and [[Ferdie Pacheco]] called the action from [[Houston]]'s [[Astrodome]].

On May 20, 1985, NBC broadcast in [[prime time]] the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Championship of the World]] bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Carl Williams (boxer)|Carl Williams]]. In what would become NBC's final prime time boxing broadcast for 30 years, [[Dick Enberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Larry Holmes vs Carl "The Truth" Williams (NBC Broadcast)|id=M7qE_ZV4uRU}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted while Marv Albert provided blow-by-blow coverage with analyst Ferdie Pacheco.

'''Carl Horst Hahn''' (born 1 July 1926) is a German businessman and former head of the [[Volkswagen Group]] from 1982 to 1993. He served as the chairman of the board of management of the [[parent company]], Volkswagen AG (formerly Volkswagenwerk AG). During his tenure, the group's car production increased from two million units in 1982 to 3.5 million a decade later.

== Early life and education ==
Hahn was born in the German state of [[Saxony]] and raised near [[Chemnitz]]. His father had been a senior manager of the German car and motorcycle company [[DKW]] and was a co-founder of the [[Auto Union]] in 1932, which later evolved into the [[Audi]] car brand. 
As a college student, he studied business administration at the [[University of Cologne]] and the [[University of Zurich]], economics and politics in [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]. In 1952, Hahn received his doctorate in Economics at the [[University of Berne]] in [[Switzerland]]. He went to Perugia for a year to study art history, intending to volunteer at Fiat.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;[http://www.hahn-carl.de/biographie.html Carl H. Hahn] Carl und Marisa Hahn-Stiftung, n.d. retrieved 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Before joining Volkswagen, he worked as an [[economist]] at the OECD in Paris in the der European Productivity Agency.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;
In 1953 Hahn joined VW as an assistant of chairman [[Heinrich Nordhoff]], and quickly became head of sales promotion in VW's export department. Hahn was a favorite of Nordhoff's. 

===Volkswagen of America, 1959–1965===
In 1959, Nordhoff made him president of the company's U.S. subsidiary, [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}Under Hahn's leadership, Volkswagen of America began a national advertising campaign to attract more attention to its quirky Beetle sedan and Microbus wagon.  Hahn soon hired the [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] ad agency, which created some of the most memorable car ads in history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Its print and television ads for the Volkswagen brand respected the customer's intelligence, gave detailed information about Volkswagen's products, and made fun of the unorthodox qualities of the cars.  The ads became cultural icons as much as the cars did, and Volkswagen enjoyed phenomenal sales in the U.S. in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Hahn became a beloved figure in the United States before his return to Germany in 1965, having been affectionately nicknamed "Mr. Volkswagen" by VW enthusiasts. While stationed in America, Hahn married Marisa Lea Traina (whose brother later married romance novelist [[Danielle Steel]]); their four children were all born in the U.S.

===Chairman of Volkswagen AG,1982–1993===
In 1973, Hahn left VW and returned to Hannover, Germany to lead the German tire company [[Continental AG]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}
In 1982, he returned to become chairman of Volkswagenwerk AG. Under his leadership, Volkswagen entered a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car brand [[SEAT]] in 1982, bought a majority interest in 1986, and by 1990 owned the entire company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.seat.com/en/company/368-seat-hoy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718053942/http://media.seat.com/en/company/368-seat-hoy.html |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1985, Hahn was able to push VW's earnings up 140 percent to $225 million based on sales of more than $21 billion, and he was credited for pushing VW beyond the one-car strategy left over from the era of air-cooled Beetles and the early success of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1]] in the 1970s.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
The [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|second-generation edition]], introduced in Europe in 1983 and in North America in 1984, was one of the bestselling cars of the 1980s worldwide.{{clarify|reason= connection to page title? |date=July 2017}}

Despite Hahn's earlier success in leading Volkswagen of America, VW sales in the United States dropped during his tenure as VW chairman, from 171,281 units in 1982 to 75,873 in 1992, largely to due intense competition from American and Japanese carmakers, and sales in Canada were hardly better.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Another issue in North America was substandard product. {{cn|date=July 2017}} Soon after Hahn became chairman of VW, he tested an American Volkswagen Rabbit built at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]], which had opened in 1978, and he was deeply disappointed. "It felt like a Chevrolet," he complained.  "If you want a Chevrolet, you should go to General Motors."{{cn|date=July 2017}}The car had been re-engineered to drive like an American family sedan, with softer suspension and shock absorbers.  Hahn fired Volkswagen of America president [[James McLernon]], a former Chevrolet engineer who had been tapped by VW to get the Westmoreland plant up and running.  Hahn brought in new management and kept the Westmoreland factory open to produce the second-generation Golf as a hedge against currency fluctuation between the German mark (DM) and the U.S. dollar, but inefficient production and soft sales in North America caused VW to close the plant in 1988.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

After [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] in 1991 Volkswagen entered a joint venture with the Czech company [[Škoda Auto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.skoda-auto.com/com/about/tradition/history/Pages/History.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217001803/http://new.skoda-auto.com/com/about/tradition/history/Pages/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hahn's acquisitions made Volkswagen a global force, and affirmed its place as Europe's largest automaker.{{cn|date=July 2017}}   
Hahn also cleaned up VW's business practices,{{according to whom|date=July 2017}} uncovering an inside [[foreign exchange fraud]], but its $300 million cost to Volkswagen ate into the very profits Hahn had helped the company make.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Legacy==
Although Hahn was applauded for making the [[Volkswagen Golf]] the most popular car in Europe, and expanding the company through the SEAT and Škoda acquisitions, Volkswagen was in financial trouble by the end of his tenure as chairman, having lost 770 million marks in the eighties surge of the European car market, maintaining a low after-tax profit margin of 2.8 percent.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Pre-tax profits went from three billion marks in 1989 to 1.785 billion marks just three years later. Hahn could not keep manufacturing and development costs under control.{{cn|date=July 2017}}  The Volkswagen board decided that Hahn had been at the helm of Volkswagen too long, and replaced him with [[Ferdinand Piëch]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Former Volkswagen of America president Bill Young, in an interview with journalist David Kiley, explained Hahn's record as chairman of VW: "Dr. Hahn had a lot on his plate in the 1980s, and [VW was] an organization that he was not suited or equipped to turn upside down the way Piech did." Automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]] offered a mixed review: "Hahn is a terrific man, and he did a lot of good things for Volkswagen, but he obviously lost interest in the American market by the time he came back in the 1980s based on the lack of attention the American division got."

[[File:Carimate Chair Vico Magistretti Cassina Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carimate Chair designed by Vico Magistretti in 1959 and produced by Cassina]]
The "Amedeo Cassina" company was created by the brothers Cesare and Umberto Cassina in 1927 in [[Meda, Lombardy|Meda]], [[Brianza]], (Northern [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/cesare-cassina/ |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Cassina, Cesare |publisher=Treccani}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Cassina continued to expand in size and fame, with products which covered a broad range of furniture including: chairs, armchairs, tables, sofas and beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architonic.com/pmabt/cassina/3100029 |title=Cassina Profile |publisher=Architonic |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company's transformation was bolstered further by commissions for cruise ships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1kRJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;dq=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IkPBVNR20bbIBIyggcgN&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Abitare |page=165 |publisher=Editrice Segesta |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ekJQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;dq=cruise+ships+Cassina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IkPBVNR20bbIBIyggcgN&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |page=94 |title=Custom-built: the concept of unique in Italian design |author=Silvana Annicchiarico |publisher=Charta |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; top end hotels and restaurants which accounted for a great part of the company's activity right up to the mid-sixties and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=6 |url=http://www.pfgroupcontract.com/uploads/object31/File/CASSINA%20CUSTOM%20INTERIORS.pdf |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=AN INTRODUCTION TO CASSINA CONTRACT DIVISION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 the "Cassina I Maestri" (Cassina Masters) Collection was born, with the acquisition of the rights to products designed by [[Le Corbusier]], Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand, the most important names of 20th century design. These included the LC1, LC2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://interiordesign.blog.nzz.ch/2014/11/28/das-doppeljubilaeum-von-le-corbusier/ |language=German |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Das Doppeljubiläum von Le Corbusier |date=November 28, 2014 |author=Von Gastautor |publisher=Interior Design |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122221208/http://interiordesign.blog.nzz.ch/2014/11/28/das-doppeljubilaeum-von-le-corbusier/# |archive-date=2015-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1990 |title=Cassina I Maestri |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hAIyAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Cassina+I+Maestri+1964&amp;dq=Cassina+I+Maestri+1964&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8kbBVPjiFoKqyATmuoCAAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ |publisher=Espresso |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books? |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Blue Print |publisher=Wordsearch Limited |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dezeen.com/2011/01/22/authentic-wood-by-le-corbusier-at-cassina/ |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |publisher=Dezeen Magazine |date=January 22, 2011 |title=Authentic Wood by Le Corbusier at Cassina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LC3 armchairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/life/homes/2011/05/18/Outdoor-living-Indoor-style-design-and-comfort-don-t-stop-at-the-back-door/stories/201105180259 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=May 18, 2011 |title=Outdoor living: Indoor style design and comfort don't stop at the back door |author=Patricia Sheridan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the LC4 chaise longue.

The "Cassina I Maestri" collection was widened in 1968 with the acquisition from Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin of reproduction rights to some of the Bauhaus objects and in 1971 the designs of [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palermotoday.it/economia/inaugurazione-cassina-arredamenti-palermo.html |language=Italian |publisher=Palermo Today |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |title=Cassina inaugura un nuovo branded space a Palermo |date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masters collection continued with the re-issue in 1983 of furniture by Erik Gunner Asplund, the acquisition from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation of rights of reproduction (1986) of furniture by Frank Lloyd Wright, including the Barrel chair (1937), and, finally, in 2004 furniture by [[Charlotte Perriand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interioresminimalistas.com/2014/12/09/la-historia-de-cassina-y-el-diseno-traves-de-18-emblematica-sillas/ |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |publisher=Interiores Minimalistas |date=December 9, 2014 |title=La historia de Cassina y el diseño a través de una exposición con 18 de sus emblemáticas sillas |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sillas de diseño|url=http://www.vackart.es/29-sillas-de-diseno|publisher=www.vackart.es|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''construction soldier''' (German: '''Bausoldat''', abbreviation: BS, colloquially: ''Spati'' an abbreviation of the German word for a spade, which was shown on the uniform of the BS) was a non-fighting member of the units of the [[National People's Army]] (NVA) of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. The BS service offered GDR citizens a possibility to refuse military service with weapons. However, it was not a civilian alternative to military service. Service as a ''Bausoldat'' could have adverse effects on future training and career development opportunities.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Before the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, [[military service in the GDR]] was voluntary, though the [[Free German Youth]] and public schools mounted intensive recruitment drives and service in the NVA was often a prerequisite for career advancement. Compulsory service had been introduced earlier in [[West Germany]] (1956)—one year after the Federal Armed Forces were established—but the GDR held back from this step until 1962. The reason was partly that the authorities feared that conscription would swell the ranks of GDR citizens fleeing to the West.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The situation changed when the border was sealed in August 1961, and five months later the government announced a mandatory service term of 18 months for men.

There was, at first, no alternative service for [[Conscientious objection in East Germany|conscientious objectors]]. This changed in 1964 when, under pressure from the national Protestant church, the GDR's National Defense Council authorized the formation of ''Baueinheiten'' (construction units) for men of draft age who "refuse military service with weapons on the grounds of religious viewpoints or for similar reasons".

The "construction soldiers" wore uniforms and lived in barracks under military discipline, but were not required to bear arms and received no combat training. In theory, they were to be used only for civilian construction projects. The GDR therefore became the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country to provide a non-combat alternative for conscientious objectors. However, fearing that other soldiers would be contaminated by [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas, the government took care to segregate the construction units from regular conscripts. Moreover, conscripts who chose the alternative service option often faced discrimination later in life, including denial of opportunities for [[Education in East Germany|higher education]].

The '''Cynefin framework''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|n|ᵻ|v|ɪ|n}} {{respell|KUN|iv|in}}) is a [[conceptual framework]] used to aid [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt; Created in 1999 by [[Dave Snowden]] when he worked for [[IBM Global Services]], it has been described as a "[[Sensemaking|sense-making]] device".&lt;ref name=Snowden1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=KurtzSnowden2003/&gt; ''Cynefin'' is a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for ''habitat''.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Jennifer Harvey|last2=Johnston|first2=Keith|title=Simple Habits for Complex Times|date=2015|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|at=236–237, n. 5|ref=harv}}{{pb}}

Cynefin offers five decision-making contexts or "domains"—''obvious'' (known until 2014 as ''simple''),{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=237, n.&amp;nbsp;7}} ''complicated'', ''complex'', ''chaotic'', and ''disorder''—that help managers to identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people's behaviour.{{efn|name=SnowdenBoonedomains}} The framework draws on research into [[systems theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[network theory]] and [[Learning theory (education)|learning theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Bob|last2=Hummelbrunner|first2=Richard|title=Systems Concepts in Action: A Practitioner's Toolkit|date=2010|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=10, 163–164|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
===Terminology===
The idea of the Cynefin framework is that it offers decision-makers a "sense of place" from which to view their perceptions.&lt;ref name=Browning2005/&gt; ''Cynefin'' is a Welsh word meaning  ''habitat'', ''haunt'', ''acquainted'', ''familiar''. Snowden uses the term to refer to the idea that we all have connections, such as tribal, religious and geographical, of which we may not be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/psychology/news/honorary-professorship-for-david-j-snowden-22486|title=Honorary Professorship for David J Snowden|date=15 April 2015|publisher=[[Bangor University]] School of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=definition/&gt; It has been compared to the [[Māori language|Maori]] word ''turangawaewae'', meaning a place to stand.{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=236–237, n.&amp;nbsp;5}} 

===History===
Snowden, then of IBM Global Services, began work on a Cynefin model in 1999 to help manage [[intellectual capital]] within the company.&lt;ref name=Snowden1999&gt;Snowden, David (1999). "Liberating Knowledge", in ''Liberating Knowledge''. CBI Business Guide. London: Caspian Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Snowden (2000): "An early form of the Cynefin model using different labels for the dimension extremes and quadrant spaces was developed as a means of understanding the reality of intellectual capital management within IBM Global Services (Snowden 1999a)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snowden|first1=Dave|editor1-last=Despres|editor1-first=Charles|editor2-last=Chauvel|editor2-first=Daniele|title=Knowledge Horizons|date=2000|publisher=Butterworth–Heinemann|location=Boston|at=[https://books.google.com/books?id=evngN1vTO-8C&amp;pg=PA239 239]|ref=harv|chapter=The Social Ecology of Knowledge Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Snowden, Dave.

[[File:Cynefin framework by Edwin Stoop.jpg|upright=2.5|thumb|centre|Sketch of the Cynefin framework, by Edwin Stoop]]

===Overview===
Cynefin offers four decision-making contexts or "domains": ''simple, complicated, complex, chaotic'', and a centre of ''disorder''.{{efn|Williams and Hummelbrunner (2010): "&amp;nbsp;... Cynefin identifies four behaviors a situation can display: simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic. This terminology is not new; the systems literature has used it for decades. However, in Cynefin the behaviors and the properties that underpin these four states are not entirely drawn from systems theories or even theories of chaos and complexity. Cynefin draws heavily on network theory, learning theories, and third-generation knowledgement management.{{pb}}"Crucially, compared with many network and company approaches, Cynefin also takes an epistemological as well as an ontological stance. Similar to the [[Soft systems methodology|Soft Systems]] and [[Critical systems thinking|Critical Systems]] traditions&amp;nbsp;... Cynefin explores how people perceive and learn from situations."{{sfn|Williams|Hummelbrunner|2010|loc=10, 163–164}}}} The domain names have changed over the years. Kurtz and Snowden (2003) called them ''known, knowable, complex, and chaotic''.&lt;ref name=KurtzSnowden2003/&gt; Snowden and Boone (2007) changed ''known'' and ''knowable'' to ''simple'' and ''complicated''.{{efn|name=SnowdenBoonedomains|Snowden and Boone (2007): "The framework sorts the issues facing leaders into five contexts defined by the nature of the relationship between cause and effect. Four of these—simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic—require leaders to diagnose situations and to act in contextually appropriate ways. The fifth—disorder—applies when it is unclear which of the other four contexts is predominant."&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt;}} Since 2014 Snowden has used ''obvious'' in place of ''simple''.{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=237, n.&amp;nbsp;7}}

The domains offer a "sense of place" from which to analyse behaviour and make decisions.&lt;ref name=Browning2005&gt;Browning, Larry; Latoza, Roderick (31 December 2005). [https://journal.emergentpublications.com/article/the-use-of-narrative-to-understand-and-respond-to-complexity-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-cynefin-and-weickian-models/pdf/ "The use of narrative to understand and respond to complexity: A comparative analysis of the Cynefin and Weickian models"], ''Emergence: Complexity and Organization'', 7(3–4): 32–39 (last modified: 23 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The domains on the right, ''simple''/''obvious'' and ''complicated'', are "ordered": cause and effect are known or can be discovered. The domains on the left, ''complex'' and ''chaotic'', are "unordered": cause and effect can be deduced only with hindsight or not at all.&lt;ref&gt;Koskela, Lauri; Kagioglou, Mike (2006).

''Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference on Lean Construction'', Sydney, Australia, July 2005 (37–45), 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple / Obvious ===
[[File:Cynefin framework, February 2011 (2).jpeg|thumb|Since 2014 Snowden has called the ''simple'' domain ''obvious''.{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=237, n.&amp;nbsp;7}}]]

The ''simple''/''obvious'' domain represents the "known knowns". This means that there are rules in place (or [[best practice]]), the situation is stable, and the relationship between cause and effect is clear: if you do X, expect Y. The advice in such a situation is to "sense–categorize–respond": establish the facts ("sense"), categorize, then respond by following the rule or applying best practice. Snowden and Boone (2007) offer the example of loan-payment processing. An employee identifies the problem (for example, a borrower has paid less than required), categorizes it (reviews the loan documents), and responds (follows the terms of the loan).&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt; According to [[Thomas A. Stewart]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the domain of legal structures, standard operating procedures, practices that are proven to work. Never draw to an [[Draw (poker)#Inside straight draw|inside straight]]. Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income. Never end the meeting without asking for the sale. Here, decision-making lies squarely in the realm of reason: Find the proper rule and apply it.&lt;ref name="Stewart2002pp4-5"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Thomas A.|title=How to Think With Your Gut|url=http://www.business2.com:80/articles/mag/0,1640,44584%7c2,FF.html|work=Business 2.0|date=November 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021105114814/http://www.business2.com:80/articles/mag/0,1640,44584%7c2,FF.html|archivedate=5 November 2002|pages=4–5|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Snowden and Boone write that managers should beware of forcing situations into this domain by over-simplifying, by "entrained thinking" (being blind to new ways of thinking), or by becoming complacent. When success breeds complacency ("best practice is, by definition, past practice"), there can be a catastrophic clockwise shift into the chaotic domain. They recommend that leaders provide a communication channel, if necessary an anonymous one, so that dissenters (for example, within a workforce) can warn about complacency.&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt;

===Complicated===
The ''complicated'' domain consists of the "known unknowns". The relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or expertise; there are a range of right answers. The framework recommends "sense–analyze–respond": assess the facts, analyze, and apply the appropriate good operating practice.&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt; According to Stewart: "Here it is possible to work rationally toward a decision, but doing so requires refined judgment and expertise.&amp;nbsp;... This is the province of engineers, surgeons, intelligence analysts, lawyers, and other experts. Artificial intelligence copes well here: [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] plays chess as if it were a complicated problem, looking at every possible sequence of moves."&lt;ref name="Stewart2002pp4-5"/&gt;

===Complex===
The ''complex'' domain represents the "unknown unknowns". Cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect, and there are no right answers. "Instructive patterns&amp;nbsp;... can emerge," write Snowden and Boone, "if the leader conducts experiments that are safe to fail." Cynefin calls this process "probe–sense–respond".&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt; Hard insurance cases are one example. "Hard cases&amp;nbsp;... need human underwriters," Stewart writes, "and the best all do the same thing: Dump the file and spread out the contents." Stewart identifies battlefields, markets, ecosystems and corporate cultures as complex systems that are "impervious to a reductionist, take-it-apart-and-see-how-it-works approach, because your very actions change the situation in unpredictable ways."&lt;ref name="Stewart2002pp4-5"/&gt;

===Chaotic===
In the ''chaotic'' domain, cause and effect are unclear.{{efn|Cynefin uses ''chaotic'' in the ordinary sense, rather than in the sense used in [[chaos theory]].{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=237, n.&amp;nbsp;11}}}} Events in this domain are "too confusing to wait for a knowledge-based response", writes Patrick Lambe. "Action—''any'' action—is the first and only way to respond appropriately."&lt;ref&gt;Lambe, Patrick (2007). ''Organising Knowledge: Taxonomies, Knowledge and Organisational Effectiveness''. Oxford: Chandos Publishing, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, managers "act–sense–respond": ''act'' to establish order; ''sense'' where stability lies; ''respond'' to turn the chaotic into the complex.&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt; Snowden and Boone write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the chaotic domain, a leader’s immediate job is not to discover patterns but to staunch the bleeding. A leader must first act to establish order, then sense where stability is present and from where it is absent, and then respond by working to transform the situation from chaos to complexity, where the identification of emerging patterns can both help prevent future crises and discern new opportunities. Communication of the most direct top-down or broadcast kind is imperative; there’s simply no time to ask for input.&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks]] were an example of the ''chaotic'' category.&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt; Stewart offers others: "the firefighter whose gut makes him turn left or the trader who instinctively sells when the news about the stock seems too good to be true." One [[Crisis management|crisis executive]] said of the [[Enron scandal|collapse of Enron]]: "People were afraid.&amp;nbsp;... Decision-making was paralyzed.&amp;nbsp;... You've got to be quick and decisive—make little steps you know will succeed, so you can begin to tell a story that makes sense."&lt;ref name="Stewart2002pp4-5"/&gt; 

Snowden and Boone give the example of the 1993 [[Brown's Chicken massacre]] in [[Palatine]], Illinois—when robbers murdered seven employees in Brown's Chicken and Pasta restaurant—as a situation in which local police faced all the domains. Deputy Police Chief Walt Gasior had to act immediately to stem the early panic (''chaotic''), while keeping the department running (''simple''), calling in experts (''complicated''), and maintaining community confidence in the following weeks (''complex'').&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt;

===Disorder / Confusion===
The dark ''disorder'' domain in the centre represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply. By definition it is hard to see when this domain applies. "Here, multiple perspectives jostle for prominence, factional leaders argue with one another, and cacophony rules", write Snowden and Boone. "The way out of this realm is to break down the situation into constituent parts and assign each to one of the other four realms. Leaders can then make decisions and intervene in contextually appropriate ways."&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt;

===Moving through domains===
As knowledge increases, there is a "clockwise drift" from ''chaotic'' through ''complex'' and ''complicated'' to ''simple''. Similarly, a "buildup of biases", complacency or lack of maintenance can cause a "catastrophic failure": a clockwise movement from ''simple'' to ''chaotic'', represented by the "fold" between those domains. There can be counter-clockwise movement as people die and knowledge is forgotten, or as new generations question the rules; and a counter-clockwise push from ''chaotic'' to ''simple'' can occur when a lack of order causes rules to be imposed suddenly.&lt;ref name=KurtzSnowden2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/&gt;

Criticism of Cynefin includes that the framework is difficult and confusing, needs a more rigorous foundation, and covers too limited a selection of possible contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, Joseph M.; McElroy, Mark W. (2011). ''Key Issues in the New Knowledge Management''. Abingdon: Routledge, 132–133 (first published 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is that terms such as ''known, knowable, sense,'' and ''categorize'' are ambiguous.{{sfn|Williams|Hummelbrunner|2010|loc=182}}

'''Sir Edward Tootal Broadhurst, 1st Baronet''' [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]], [[Justice of the peace|JP]] (19 August 1858 – 2 February 1922) was a director and eventually chairman of [[Tootal Broadhurst Lee]], one of the largest cotton manufacturers in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/46/101046780/|title=Edward Tootal Broadhurst| work=Oxford National Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the chairman of the [[Manchester and Liverpool District Bank]], and a director of the [[London and North Western Railway]] and the Atlas Insurance Company.&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; He was [[High Sheriff of Lancashire]] in 1906–7.

Broadhurst was born in Broughton, near Manchester.  He was the second son of Henry Tootal Broadhurst.  Some relations, such as [[Charles Edward Broadhurst]], emigrated to Australia.  He was educated at [[Eagle House School]] in Wimbledon, and then at [[Winchester College]].  He started to work at the family cotton business in 1876.  He married Charlotte Jane Ashton in 1887;&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; her father was also a cotton manufacturer, [[Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde|Thomas Ashton]]; her brother was [[Thomas Gair Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde]].

Broadhurst's father and grandfather were both cotton manufacturers.  His father joined forces with [[Henry Lee (Southampton MP)|Henry Lee]] and [[Joseph Cocksey Lee|Joseph Lee]] and [[Robert Scott (businessman born 1822)|Robert Scott]] to form a partnership that became [[Tootal, Broadhurst Lee]] Limited, which integrated cotton spinning and [[power loom]] weaving.&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; It was the third largest [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] cotton business in Lancashire, with around 5,000 employees in 1887.&lt;ref name="DBB"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Jeremy|title=Dictionary of business biography: a biographical dictionary of business leaders active in Britain in the period 1860–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=io3sAAAAMAAJ|date=July 1984|publisher=Butterworths}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mills included [[Sunnyside Mill]] in Bolton, and [[Ten Acres Mill]] and [[Hemming Works]] near Manchester.
Broadhurst's main responsibility in the company was on the finance committee of which he became chair in 1900; in 1907
he became company chairman.&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; Broadhurst lived in the Manor House at North Rode near Congleton, and lived the lifestyle of a country gentleman, spending August and September of each year at his grouse moor in Scotland.&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; For the rest of the year he was a dedicated businessman, though he took extended periods of leave because of nervous illness in 1910, 1912 and 1916.&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt;

Broadhurst was president of the Prestwich Conservative Association, but unlike many other [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservatives]], who favoured tariffs to protect the domestic markets of British businesses, he was in favour of [[free trade]].&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; In early 1906, he crossed party lines to support [[Winston Churchill]], the successful [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for [[Manchester North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester North West]].&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt;
Broadhurst also supported Churchill at a by-election in 1908, required after Churchill was appointed as [[President of the Board of Trade]].&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; The seat was won by the Conservative candidate [[William Joynson-Hicks]], who described Broadhurst as a "[[Mugwump]] Millionaire".

Broadhurst joined the committee that organised the recruitment of the [[Manchester Pals]] battalions in the First World War, raising funds towards the cost of uniforms and equipment,&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; and joined the Cotton Control Board in 1917.  He was also involved in good works, as a governor of the [[Whitworth Art Gallery|Whitworth Institute]], chairman of the Manchester and Salford Lifeboat Fund, and a member of the council of [[Manchester University]].  In March 1906, Broadhurst was appointed a [[deputy lieutenant]] of [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | issue=27896 |page=1973 | date=20 March 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Broadhurst donated land in [[Moston, Manchester|Moston]] to [[Manchester Corporation]] in 1920, as an offering of thanks to the men and women of Manchester for the work they had done in the First World War, the location becoming known as Broadhurst Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofbroadhurst.org.uk/history- Friends of Broadhurst – history] 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/500194/irk_river_valley_project/4768/broadhurst_clough/2 Broadhurst Clough – The Journey so Far], Manchester City Council&lt;/ref&gt; The football ground of [[F.C. United of Manchester]] was built in the area in 2015, also called [[Broadhurst Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands watch F.C.

Broadhurst was created a [[baronet]], largely for his local war work, on 4 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30958 |date=18 October 1918 |page=12249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt; The baronetcy became extinct upon his death as he and his wife had no children. He left an estate of £149, 903.&lt;ref name="DBB"/&gt;

'''Ernest Walter Saunders''' (born 21 October 1935) is a British former business manager, best known as one of the [[Guinness share-trading fraud|"Guinness Four"]], a group of businessmen who attempted fraudulently to manipulate the share price of the [[Guinness]] company. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, but released after 10 months as he was believed to be suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], which is incurable. He subsequently made a full recovery.

==Personal life==
He was born '''Ernest Walter Schleyer''' in [[Austria]] and moved to the United Kingdom in 1938 when his parents - a [[Jewish]] gynaecologist and an Austrian mother -&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Fallon &amp; James Srodes, ''Takeovers'', H. Hamilton (1987), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; emigrated to escape Nazi rule. He was educated at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]. He married Carole Ann Stephing in 1963, and has two sons and one daughter.

==Professional life==
He had a career in management with [[GlaxoSmithKline|Beecham]], [[GUS (retailer)|Great Universal Stores]] and [[Nestlé]] before becoming chief executive of [[Guinness]] plc (now a part of [[Diageo]] plc) in 1981, remaining in the position until 1986. He was renowned for his ruthless cost-cutting efficiency, earning from his employees the sobriquet 'Deadly Ernest'.

Under his charge, early in 1986, Guinness plc launched a friendly takeover bid for Edinburgh-based [[Distillers Company]] plc, which was being stalked by a hostile bidder. This was effected by quietly boosting the Guinness share price. Subsequent to the bid, which resulted in success for Guinness, Saunders was charged (along with [[Jack Lyons (financier)|Jack Lyons]], [[Anthony Parnes]] and [[Gerald Ronson]]) and convicted on 27 August 1990 of counts of conspiracy to contravene section 13(1)(a)(i) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958, false accounting and theft, in relation to dishonest conduct in a share support operation (see [[Guinness share-trading fraud]]). A series of appeals was finally dismissed in December 2002, although a ruling by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in ''[[Saunders v. the United Kingdom]]'' declared that the defendants were denied a fair trial by being compelled to provide potentially self-incriminatory information to [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) inspectors which was then used as primary evidence against them. This breached their privilege against self-incrimination.

While there was no suggestion that Saunders himself sought to or actually did profit from these offences in an immediate or direct manner, the allegation was that they were committed to increase the likelihood of their company's takeover bid succeeding. His board of directors at Guinness plc was not informed of, and had not sanctioned, his arrangements, which included indemnities for unknowable amounts. He had passed $100&amp;nbsp;million to the American [[Ivan Boesky]] to invest shortly before Boesky's prosecution and imprisonment for [[insider trading]], and following that investigation Saunders' plans were revealed to the DTI in Britain.&lt;ref name="fight for acquittal"&gt;{{cite news | last=Verdin | first=Mike|  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1723136.stm | title=Guinness Four fail in fight for acquittal | publisher= BBC News| date=21 December 2001 | accessdate=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DTI report described him as a man who did "unjustifiable favours for friends and himself".&lt;ref name=highflying&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/life-and-high-flying-times-of-four-partners-in-crime-1-590390 | title=Life and high-flying times of four partners in crime| newspaper=The Scotsman| date=22 December 2001 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentence and appeal==

Saunders appealed against his prison sentence of five years and three expert witnesses appeared at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Appeal Court]]. A consultant neurologist acting for the Crown, Dr Perkins, insisted that Saunders was suffering from depression rather than [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="Shepherd"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Shepherd |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/forget-alzheimers--saunders-1388784.html |title=Forget Alzheimer's – Saunders |date=30 December 1994 |work=The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the other expert witnesses, another neurologist, used brain scans and other evidence to indicate that Saunders brain was abnormally small for a man of his age, an observation which he said was consistent with a brain disease diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Warner [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-ernest-saunders-out-of-jail-and-back-in-business-1347932.html "Profile: Ernest Saunders; Out of jail and back in business"], ''The Independent'', 18 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1991, the sentence was reduced to two and a half years. Lord Justice Neill said that he was satisfied that Saunders was suffering from pre-senile dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, which is incurable.&lt;ref name="fight for acquittal"/&gt; The decision was based on evidence from Dr Patrick Gallwey, a forensic pathologist, that Saunders was unable to recite three numbers backwards, was unable to use a door and his assertion that [[Gerald Ford]] rather than [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] was the current President of the United States.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boggan"&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Boggan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/lucky-ernie-from-dazed-old-man-to-rich-adviser-1314871.html |title=Lucky Ernie: from dazed old man to rich adviser |date=17 December 1996 |work=The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his apparent illness, Saunders was released from [[Ford Open Prison]] on 28 June 1991 having served only ten months of his sentence. (He would normally have been expected to have served 15 months of the 30-month sentence). After his release, he recovered from the symptoms which had led to the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=highflying/&gt; Saunders himself claimed in 1994 that he was never diagnosed with Alzheimer's,&lt;ref name="Shepherd"/&gt; When asked by ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1996, Dr Gallwey commented: "In the early stages of Alzheimer's or pre-senile dementia, it can be very difficult to make a diagnosis, so we did not make one; we expressed worries about it."&lt;ref name="Boggan"/&gt; It has been suggested he was in reality suffering from memory loss caused by stress.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Blackhurst [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-renaissance-man-1256097.html "The Renaissance man"], ''The Independent on Sunday'', 15 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Since apparently recovering from Alzheimer's, Saunders has worked as a business consultant, including advising mobile phone retailer [[Carphone Warehouse]] from its early days until prior to its flotation. [[Charles Dunstone]], the Chief executive of Carphone Warehouse, said: "We were young guys who didn’t know what we were doing. He made us think about the questions we ought to ask or the information we ought to look at."

He was later appointed chairman of the executive committee of a US-based multinational petrol credit-card company, Harpur-Gelco.

Saunders also acted as a consultant to Seed International Ltd, a company based in the Cayman Islands. Seed offered investments in a variety of fields including wine, property, oil and gas exploration through  Ocean International Marketing, their sales subsidiary with offices in Rotterdam.

'''George Aitken Clark''' (1823–1873) was a Scottish manufacturer and benefactor.

==Life==
He was the son of John Clark, a thread manufacturer in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], where he was born on 9 August 1823. He was educated at [[Paisley grammar school]], and in 1840 was sent the firm of Kerr &amp; Co. of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. On reaching manhood he returned to Paisley, and entered into partnership with Messrs. Robert and John Ronald, shawlmakers, under the name of "Ronald &amp; Clark".&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clark, George Aitken|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851 Clark gave up his partnership to go into with his brother-in-law, Robert Kerr, as a thread manufacturer. To extend the business he went in 1856 to the United States, and to avoid the tariffs the firm in 1864 established a factory at [[Newark, New Jersey]]. It was a success, and Clark's O.N.T. spool cotton soon became a recognised American brand. In 1866 the firm amalgamated with the original firm of Clark under the name of Clark &amp; Co.,with an anchor as their trade-mark. Clark died at Newark on 13 February 1873.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Paisley Town Hall.jpg|thumb|Paisley Town Hall]]
By his will Clark left £20,000 for scholarships at [[Glasgow University]], and £20,000 to build a town hall in Paisley. The firm of Clark &amp; Co. subscribed a further £40,000, and the building then styled the "George A. Clark Town Hall" was opened in 1882.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The architect was [[William Henry Lynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=63609|title=Lynn, William Henry|first=Paul|last=Larmour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually a [[boy]] or young teenager. The name derives from the fact that the hall boy usually sleeps in the [[servants hall]].&lt;ref name="JoySeaman2007"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.|last1= Joy|first2=M. |last2= Seaman|first3=K. |last3= Bell|first4=M. |last4=Ramsey|title=Cultural Studies of the Modern Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGeJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|date=9 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-61004-0|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Like his female counterpart, the [[scullery maid]], the hall boy would have been expected to work up to 16 hours per day, seven days per week.  His duties were often among the most disagreeable in the house, such as emptying [[chamber pot]]s for the higher-ranking servants, and (in the absence of a [[boot boy]]) cleaning the [[boot]]s.  

A hall boy could rise through the ranks and, if fortunate, eventually become a [[valet]] or [[butler]].  Arthur Inch, butler technical consultant for the film ''[[Gosford Park]]'', stated in an interview that he began his life in service as a hall boy at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The butler did it--but how? |first=Patricia Dane |last=Rogers |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-11-30/features/0311300514_1_napkins-tables-dinner |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=30 November 2003 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hansjörg Wyss''' (born 19 September 1935) is a Swiss entrepreneur, businessman, and philanthropist. He is the founder and was president, then chairman, of Synthes USA, until its sale in 2012. Wyss lives in Wyoming and has supported philanthropic causes relating to environmental protection, social justice, and science. His contributions led to the establishment of the [[Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering]] at [[Harvard University]] in 2009 and he created the Wyss Foundation, which aims to conserve natural environments, including public lands in the [[Western United States]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]]. As of 2017, Wyss has a net worth of US$5.6 billion, according to ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref name="Forbes1215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bulletin"&gt;Wilkinson, Tara Loader. [http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2008-10-08/switzerlands-second-richest-man-makes-big-donation-to-harvard Switzerland's second richest man makes big donation to Harvard], ''[[Financial News|Wealth Bulletin]]'', 8 October 2008; retrieved 15 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Wyss was born in [[Bern]], Switzerland in 1935. His father sold mechanical calculators and his mother was a homemaker. He was raised in an apartment with two sisters.&lt;ref name=Bonzom11/&gt; After receiving a master's degree in Civil and Structural Engineering from the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]] in 1959,&lt;ref name=Connolly11&gt;{{cite news|title=Wyss May Top Bertarelli as Richest Swiss Man in Synthes Sale|author=Allison Connolly |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-04-19/wyss-may-replace-bertarelli-as-richest-swiss-man-in-synthes-sale|work=Bloomberg.com|date=20 April 2011|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyss earned an [[MBA]] from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1965. Following that, he worked in various positions in the textile industry, including plant engineer and project manager for [[Chrysler]] in Pakistan, Turkey, and the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Connolly11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvard07&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alumni.hbs.edu/stories/Pages/story-bulletin.aspx?num=2000|title=Hansjörg Wyss, MBA 1965|date=1 January 2007|work=alumni.hbs.edu|publisher=[[Harvard Business School]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyss also worked in the steel industry in [[City of Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]].&lt;ref name=Connolly11/&gt; During his time working in that industry, Wyss ran a side business selling airplanes. Through one sale, he met a surgeon who had co-founded Swiss [[medical device]] manufacturer [[Synthes]].&lt;ref name=Hill09&gt;{{cite news|title=Legal troubles for local billionaire|author=Miriam Hill|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20091206_Legal_troubles_for_local_billionaire.html|work=[[Philadelphia Media Network|Philly.com]]|date=6 December 2009|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that meeting, Wyss spent two years learning about the medical device industry. He founded and became president of Synthes USA in 1977.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt;

==Synthes USA==
{{main|Synthes}}
In 1977, Wyss founded and became president of Synthes USA,&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harbus15/&gt; the U.S. division of Switzerland-based [[Synthes]] medical device manufacturer making internal screws and plates for broken bones.&lt;ref name=Hill09/&gt; In an early initiative, Wyss opened a Synthes USA manufacturing plant in Colorado.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; Prior to that, another Switzerland company manufactured Synthes' devices and exported them to the U.S.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; Under Wyss' control, the U.S. division expanded its sales team and trained surgeons how to use its products.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; Wyss served as Synthes' worldwide CEO and chairman until his resignation as CEO in 2007.&lt;ref name=Connolly11/&gt; He maintained his post as company chairman until [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] acquired Synthes in 2012.&lt;ref name=Herper11&gt;{{cite news|title=Synthes Sale Creates $8.7 Billion Man|author=Matthew Herper|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/04/27/synthes-sale-creates-8-7-billion-man|work=[[Forbes]]|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=George12&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson completes $20B takeover of Synthes|author=John George|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2012/06/14/johnson-johnson-completes-20b.html|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Philadelphia Business Journal]]|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, Wyss said discussions of new products made up one-third of board meetings.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; A manager assigned to the Norian project testified before a grand jury that "for somebody who is at his level and his level of success, I would say he [Wyss] has a surprising amount of contact with what's going on." Staff recalled meetings in which he intensively probed their projects.&lt;ref name="badtothebone"/&gt;

In 2009, top executives at Synthes were indicted by U.S. Attorneys for Eastern Pennsylvania for using an untested calcium-phosphate-based bone cement on human patients without the authorization from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], which resulted in the deaths of three people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/three-people-died-in-illegal-human-experiments-carried-out-by-john-podesta-backers-firm/article/2551139 "Three people died in illegal human experiments carried out by John Podesta backer's firm"], washingtonexaminer.com; accessed 21 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyss was not indicted but four of Synthes' top executives were convicted and sentenced to prison terms.&lt;ref name="badtothebone"&gt;[http://fortune.com/2012/09/18/bad-to-the-bone-a-medical-horror-story "Bad to the Bone - a Medical Horror Story"], fortune.com, 18 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Wyss sold the company for $21.3 billion in cash and stock to [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].&lt;ref name="bulletin"&gt;Wilkinson, Tara Loader.

==Philanthropy==
According to ''[[Forbes]]'', Wyss is "among the most [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] people in the world".&lt;ref name="Forbes1215"/&gt; Between 2004 and 2008, ''[[Businessweek]]'' estimated that Wyss personally donated nearly USD$277 million.&lt;ref name=Hill09/&gt; His giving has increased since the sale of Synthes in 2012 and in 2013 he signed [[The Giving Pledge]], agreeing to give away the majority of his fortune.&lt;ref name=Forbes1215/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams14&gt;{{cite news|title=Wyss, Yet Another Big Philanthropist, Turns to the Oceans|author=Tate Williams|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/11/4/wyss-yet-another-big-philanthropist-turns-to-the-oceans.html|work=Inside Philanthropy|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assets of his charitable foundations equal nearly $2 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes1215/&gt;

His primary philanthropic causes are the [[Environmental movement|environment]], [[social justice]],&lt;ref name=Williams14/&gt; and [[science]],&lt;ref name=Hill09/&gt; but he frequently contributes to historic projects and [[Europe]]an museums.&lt;ref name=Connolly11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes1215/&gt; The Wyss Foundation, a charitable organization he founded, has awarded grants for environmental protection as well as to [[Progressivism|progressive]] policy organizations, including the [[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]], [[Health Leads]], and the [[Constitutional Accountability Center]].&lt;ref name=Williams17/&gt;

===Environmental protection===
As of 2017, Wyss and the Wyss Foundation have donated more than $350 million to [[environmental protection]], including [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] of national forests and other public lands in the [[Western United States]].&lt;ref name=Taylor15&gt;{{cite news|title='Quietly philanthropic' tycoon makes his mark in the West|author=Phil Taylor|url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060015651|work=[[Environment &amp; Energy Publishing]]|date=24 May 2015|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 Wyss published an article in the [[New York Times]] stating that he was contributing 1 billion dollars to environmental causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/earth-biodiversity-conservation-billion-dollars.html|title=We Have to Save the Planet.

Wyss has stated that he became passionate about the American West and land preservation after visiting the U.S. in 1958 as a student and taking a summer job as a [[Surveying|surveyor]] with the Colorado Highway Department.&lt;ref name=Bonzom11&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernese billionaire works to keep West wild|author=Marie-Christine Bonzom|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bernese-billionaire-works-to-keep-west-wild/31446480|work=[[Swissinfo]]|date=27 October 2011|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown10/&gt; In 1998, he created the Wyss Foundation&lt;ref name=Suchecki15&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Billionaire Comes to the Defense of Africa's Elephants and Rhinos|author=Paul M.J.

==Political views==
In 2015, Wyss publicly declared himself to be in favour of higher inheritance taxes (estate/death duty taxes) for the wealthy in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blick: Hansjörg Wyss, der Freund der Erbschaftssteuer|url=http://www.blick.ch/news/politik/hansjoerg-wyss-der-freund-der-erbschaftssteuer-keiner-weiss-wo-er-steuern-zahlt-id3825709.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long-lasting rivalry between billionaire Wyss, who supports left-wing politics, and billionaire conservative [[Christoph Blocher]]. Both entered into public debates about the bilateral contracts between [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Union]] as well as the limitation of immigrants into Switzerland. Wyss, on the one hand, attempted to outline and foster the advantages of openness towards the EU and immigrants while Blocher, on the other hand, sought to highlight and emphasize the independence of Switzerland in those matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blick: Hansjörg Wyss und Christoph Blocher - Die Schlacht der alten Milliardäre|url=http://www.blick.ch/news/politik/wahlen2015/hansjoerg-wyss-und-christoph-blocher-die-schlacht-der-alten-milliardaere-id4095937.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ilan Shor''' (or '''Șor''';&lt;ref name=whewell/&gt; born 6 March 1987) is a Moldovan businessman and politician, who is currently under house arrest for alleged fraud after being condemned in the controversial Kroll report. Since 2015 as the elected mayor of the Moldovan city of [[Orhei]].&lt;ref name="cec-mayors"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cec.md/index.php?pag=page&amp;id=1587&amp;l=ro | title= Lista primarilor aleși în cadrul Alegerilor Locale Generale din 14 iunie 2015 | publisher= Comisia Electorală Centrală a Republicii Moldova | year=2015 | accessdate=15 April 2016|language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is widely seen as a form of political oppression by the ruling Party. He owns several Moldovan businesses, including a company named ''Dufremol'' (Duty-free) and the [[FC Milsami]] [[association football|football]] club. In 2014, he became the chairman of the board of the Saving Bank of Moldova. He has reported in an interview that he started his own business at 13 in a mobile phone shop. He is good friends with another Moldovan millionaire, Gabi Stati.

== Personal life ==
Ilan Shor was born in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel on 6 March 1987, the son of Miron Shor and his wife, [[History of the Jews in Moldova|Moldovan Jews]] from [[Chișinău]] who had [[aliyah|moved to Israel]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=krasotin&gt;{{cite news

== The $1 billion bank fraud scandal ==

The Kroll report claims that although the final beneficiaries are unknown, some companies that Ilan Shor has links to benefited, either directly or indirectly, from loans issued from the three banks involved in the [[Moldovan bank fraud scandal]]. On November 26, 2014 the banks went bankrupt and were later placed under special administration of the National Bank of Moldova. On 27 November, the Moldovan Government, headed by Prime Minister [[Iurie Leancă]], secretly decided to bail out the three banks with $870 million in emergency loans, covered from state reserves. This created a deficit in Moldovan public finances equivalent to an eighth of the country's GDP.

In the week preceding the 2014 Moldovan parliamentary elections, more than $750 million were extracted from the three banks between 24 and 26 November. A van belonging to Klassica Force, while transporting 12 sacks of bank files, was stolen and burned on November 27.&lt;ref name="CNN Money"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/07/news/economy/moldova-stolen-billion/]&lt;/ref&gt; Records of many transactions were deleted from the banks' computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-20075453-cine-este-ilan-shor-personajul-principal-din-raportul-krull-privind-furtul-secolului-din-republica-moldova-omul-afaceri-controleaza-banci-aeroportul-din-chisinau-televiziuni-club-fotbal.htm |title=Cine este Ilan Shor, personajul principal din raportul Kroll privind "Furtul Secolului" din Republica Moldova. Omul de afaceri controleaza banci, Aeroportul din Chisinau, televiziuni si un club de fotbal |work=HotNews.ro |date=5 May 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 Ilan Shor was suspected by the National Anti-Corruption Center (NAC) for his work in Saving Bank. On 17 March 2015 he was questioned for 8 hours and Anti Corruption officers seized his personal property. On May 6 2015 Shor was placed under house arrest. As of 2015, Shor is allowed to move freely, after a period of house arrest. This is because he fully cooperated with the investigation. Despite this, he was allowed to register for electoral race for the mayor of city of [[Orhei]], a contest in which he won 62% of the vote on June 14 [[Moldovan local election, 2015|local government election]].&lt;ref name=railean/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2015/05/06/secret-audit-report-links-missing-1-billion-to-28-years-old-moldovan-businessman/|title=Did Ilan Shor Take the Missing $1 Billion From Moldovan Banks?|work=Jewish Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-born-billionaire-accused-in-moldova-scheme-to-stay-under-house-arrest/|title=Israeli-born billionaire accused in Moldova scheme to stay under house arrest|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mayor of Orhei == 
After having been elected as Mayor of Orhei on the 14th June with 62% of the vote, Ilan has been busy modernising and improving the City. Notable works include building over 30km of roads for the City, which has led to a large investment in the form of a new electrical wiring factory employing 2500 workers, as well as a new asphalt factory. These were both deals that Ilan took great personal interest in. He has also introduced maternity payments which have so far reached over 500 mothers, and introduced a new method of digital submissions to the City governance, which means people can register comments and complaints, and track their progress online. This is part of his new directive on open governance. 

He has invested a large amount of personal money in making Orhei a better living environment, including 1300 Lamposts with LED lights - making the streets safer and simultaneously cutting the electricity budget through replacing the existing inefficient ones. He has renovated the Ivanos Park, after 80 years of dereliction, and has poured a large amount of investment into Orhei lake - creating recreational facilities, landscaped beaches, and modern sports facilities. Ilan's Government and investment policies have paid off, with the income of the average worker rising by 300% since he took office.

It is concerned with the understanding and application of Engineering Procedures in Manufacturing Processes and Production Methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polytech-reseau.org/en/polytech-education/industrial-engineering/|title=Industrial Engineering|website=www.polytech-reseau.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1|title=Handbook of Electronics Manufacturing Engineering|last=Matisoff|first=Bernard S.|date=1986|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789401170406|pages=1–4|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial Engineering dates back all the way to the industrial revolution, initiated in 1700s by Sir [[Adam Smith]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Eli Whitney]], [[Frank Gilbreth]] and [[Lilian Gilbreth]], [[Henry Gantt]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]], etc. After the 1970s, industrial and production engineering developed worldwide and started to widely use automation and robotics. Industrial and production Engineering includes three areas:  [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical Engineering]] (where the production engineering comes from), [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]], and [[Management science|Management Science]]. The main objective for people within this discipline is to improve efficiency, drive up effectiveness of manufacturing, quality control, and to reduce cost while making their products more attractive and marketable. Industrial engineering is concerned with the development, improvement, and implementation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials, as well as analysis and synthesis. The principles of IPE include mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from the systems or processes currently in place or being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubt.edu.sa/CE/Industrial-Engineering-Department/Overview|title=UBT &gt; CE &gt; Industrial Engineering Department &gt; Overview|last=UBT|website=www.ubt.edu.sa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of production engineering is to complete the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way. Production engineering also overlaps substantially with [[manufacturing engineering]] and [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=William|date=|title=Life as a Production Engineer|url=http://www.acetherapist.com/Content/Life_as_a_Production_Engineer.pdf|journal=ACE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of production engineering is interchangeable with manufacturing engineering.

As for education, undergraduates normally start off by taking courses such as physics, mathematics (calculus, linear analysis, differential equations), computer science, and chemistry. Undergraduates will take more major specific courses like production and inventory scheduling, process management, CAD/CAM Manufacturing, ergonomics, etc., towards the later years of their undergraduate careers. In some parts of the world, universities will offer Bachelor's in Industrial and Production Engineering. However, most universities in the U.S. will offer them separately. Various career paths that may follow for industrial and production engineers include: [[Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada|Plant Engineers]], [[Manufacturing engineering|Manufacturing Engineers]], [[Quality engineering|Quality Engineers]], [[Process engineering|Process Engineers]] and Industrial Managers, [[Project management|Project Management]], [[Manufacturing]], Production and Distribution, From all the various career paths people can take as an Industrial and Production Engineer, most  average a starting salary of at least $50,000.

== History ==

=== Industrial Revolution ===
The roots of the Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the [[Flying shuttle]], the [[Spinning jenny]], and perhaps most importantly the [[Steam engine]] generated [[Economies of scale]] that made [[Mass production]] in centralized locations attractive for the first time.  The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2"&gt;Maynard &amp; Zandin. Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook. McGraw Hill Professional 5th Edition. June 5, 2001. p. 1.4–1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialization of labor ===
[[File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Watt's steam engine ([[Technical University of Madrid]])]]Adam Smith's concepts of [[Division of Labour]] and the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism introduced in his treatise "[[The Wealth of Nations]]" motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems.  The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

[[Charles Babbage]] became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s.  The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

=== Interchangeable parts ===
[[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]] proved the feasibility of the notion of [[Interchangeable parts]] in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government.  Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product.  The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

=== Modern development ===

==== Industrial engineering ====
In 1960 to 1975, with the velopment of decision support systems in supply such as the [[Material requirements planning]] (MRP), people can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kádárová|first=Jaroslava|date=|title=Education in Industrial Engineering in Slovakia|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042814043079/1-s2.0-S1877042814043079-main.pdf?_tid=b359991c-176e-4eb6-aee1-0b4713b51767&amp;acdnat=1524330232_40bd0bc004738e78d58cb34007541ed3|journal=Procedia|volume=143|pages=157–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as [[Kaizen]] and [[Kanban]], Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity. These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility. Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own [[Continuous improvement]] programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management, and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Manufacturing (production) engineering  ====
Modern manufacturing engineering studies include all intermediate processes required for the production and integration of a product's components.{{Main|Semiconductor manufacturing}}Some industries, such as [[semiconductor]] and [[steel]] manufacturers use the term "fabrication" for these processes.[[File:Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg|right|thumb|300x300px|KUKA industrial robots being used at a bakery for food production{{Main|Automation}}]][[Automation]] is used in different processes of manufacturing such as machining and welding. Automated manufacturing refers to the application of automation to produce goods in a factory. The main advantages of automated manufacturing for the manufacturing process are realized with effective implementation of automation and include: higher consistency and quality, reduction of lead times, simplification of production, reduced handling, improved work flow, and improved worker morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj5QBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=higher+consistency+and+quality,+reduction+of+lead+times,+simplification+of+production,+reduced+handling,+improved+work+flow,+and+improved+worker+morale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h07o74up4M&amp;sig=lNSIq_dTOKi8sFuTm-ix5HgTtks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilyYir8svaAhWQON8KHc0fCUYQ6AEIPzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=higher%20consistency%20and%20quality,%20reduction%20of%20lead%20times,%20simplification%20of%20production,%20reduced%20handling,%20improved%20work%20flow,%20and%20improved%20worker%20morale&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Kurdistan's Economy and Society in Transition: Volume II|last=Heshmati|first=Almas|last2=Dilani|first2=Alan|last3=Baban|first3=Serwan M.

[[Robotics]] is the application of mechatronics and automation to create robots, which are often used in manufacturing to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot). Robots are used extensively in manufacturing engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muhendislik.sdu.edu.tr/makinemuh/en/general-informations/what-is-mechanical-engineering-3585s.html|title=What is Mechanical Engineering – MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT – Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi|last=University|first=Süleyman Demirel|website=muhendislik.sdu.edu.tr|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robots allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Main|Robotics}}

Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubt.edu.sa/CE/Industrial-Engineering-Department/Overview|title=UBT &gt; CE &gt; Industrial Engineering Department &gt; Overview|last=UBT|website=www.ubt.edu.sa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[Queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biethapathali.blogspot.com/2017/11/blog-post_28.html|title=Industrial Engineering|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[queueing theory]], and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of [[data science]] and [[machine learning]] in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]], as well as having [[Computer programming|coding]] skills).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Manufacturing (production) engineering ===
Manufacturing Engineering is based on core [[industrial engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]] skills, adding important elements from mechatronics, commerce, economics and business management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/mechanical-engineering/study-with-us/types-of-mechanical-and-manufacturing-engineering/manufacturing-engineering|title=Manufacturing Engineering|date=2013-08-08|work=School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field also deals with the integration of different facilities and systems for producing quality products (with optimal expenditure) by applying the principles of physics and the results of manufacturing systems studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gtc_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=This+field+also+deals+with+the+integration+of+different+facilities+and+systems+for+producing+quality+products&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9uh6E97PRw&amp;sig=AcIYNwkNf1xiQO5rH_mX0sG0T74&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvtuatwcvaAhVP1lMKHWLwC_sQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=This%20field%20also%20deals%20with%20the%20integration%20of%20different%20facilities%20and%20systems%20for%20producing%20quality%20products&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Future Manufacturing Engineering: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Future Manufacturing Engineering (ICFME 2014), Hong Kong, December 10–11, 2014|last=Yang|first=Guohui|date=2015-05-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781315684628|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the following:{{div col|colwidth=25em}}

It is a very broad area which includes the design and development of products. Manufacturing engineering is considered to be a sub-discipline of [[industrial engineering]]/[[systems engineering]] and has very strong overlaps with [[mechanical engineering]]. Manufacturing engineers' success or failure directly impacts the advancement of technology and the spread of innovation. This field of manufacturing engineering emerged from tool and die discipline in the early 20th century. It expanded greatly from the 1960s when industrialized countries introduced factories with:

1. [[Numerical control]] machine tools and automated systems of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Mike|title=Key CNC Concept #1—The Fundamentals Of CNC|url=https://www.mmsonline.com/articles/key-cnc-concept-1the-fundamentals-of-cnc|website=www.mmsonline.com|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Advanced statistical methods of [[quality control]]: These factories were pioneered by the American electrical engineer [[William Edwards Deming]], who was initially ignored by his home country. The same methods of quality control later turned Japanese factories into world leaders in cost-effectiveness and production quality.

3. [[Industrial robots]] on the factory floor, introduced in the late 1970s: These computer-controlled [[welding]] arms and grippers could perform simple tasks such as attaching a car door quickly and flawlessly 24 hours a day. This cut costs and improved production speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keerthitravels.com/services/agricultural-processing/|title=Manufacturing Engineer – Keerthi Travels|website=keerthitravels.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

=== Industrial engineering ===

==== Undergraduate curriculum ====
In the United States the undergraduate degree earned is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science and Engineering (B.S.E.) in Industrial Engineering (IE).  Variations of the title include Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering (IOE), and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE).  The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning [[chemistry]], [[physics]], mechanics (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, [[engineering design]], and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], [[statistics]]). For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work – which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.

The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as [[optimization]], [[applied probability]], [[stochastic]] modeling, [[design of experiments]], [[statistical process control]], [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]]/[[safety engineering]], and [[engineering economics]]. Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as [[manufacturing]], [[supply chains]] and [[logistics]], [[analytics]] and [[machine learning]], [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], [[human factors]] and [[industrial design]], and [[service system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/industrial-engineering/courses|title=ISyE Undergraduate Courses|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/ind_eng/|title=Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IND ENG)|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/depts/ioe/courses|title=Courses|publisher=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/courses/|title=Courses|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/electives.html|title=ISE Electives|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

==== Graduate curriculum ====
The usual graduate degree earned is the Master of Science (MS) or Master of Science and Engineering (MSE) in Industrial Engineering or various alternative related concentration titles. Typical MS curricula may cover:

=== Manufacturing (production) engineering ===

==== Degree certification programs ====
Manufacturing engineers possess an associate's or bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in manufacturing engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually two to five years followed by five more years of professional practice to qualify as a professional engineer. Working as a manufacturing engineering technologist involves a more applications-oriented qualification path.

Academic degrees for manufacturing engineers are usually the Associate or Bachelor of Engineering, [BE] or [BEng], and the Associate or Bachelor of Science, [BS] or [BSc]. For manufacturing technologists the required degrees are Associate or Bachelor of Technology [B.TECH] or Associate or Bachelor of Applied Science [BASc] in Manufacturing, depending upon the university. Master's degrees in engineering manufacturing include Master of Engineering [ME] or [MEng] in Manufacturing, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Manufacturing Management, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Industrial and Production Management, and Master of Science [M.Sc] as well as Master of Engineering [ME] in Design, which is a subdiscipline of manufacturing. Doctoral [PhD] or [DEng] level courses in manufacturing are also available depending on the university.

The undergraduate degree curriculum generally includes courses in physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and specific topics in mechanical and manufacturing engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of manufacturing engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their degree work.

Specific to Industrial Engineers, people will see courses covering ergonomics, scheduling, inventory management, forecasting, product development, and in general courses that focus on optimization. Most colleges breakdown the large sections of industrial engineering into Healthcare, Ergonomics, Product Development, or Consulting sectors. This allows for the student to get a good grasp on each of the varying sub-sectors so they know what area they are most interested about pursuing a career in.

==== Undergraduate curriculum ====
The Foundational Curriculum for a bachelor's degree of Manufacturing Engineering or Production Engineering includes below mentioned Syllabus. This Syllabus is closely related to Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. But it Differs by Placing more Emphasis on Manufacturing Science or Production Science. It includes following:
{| class="wikitable"
|
* Mathematics (Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics and Linear Algebra)
* Mechanics (Statics &amp; Dynamics)
* Solid Mechanics
* Fluid Mechanics
* Materials Science
* Strength of Materials
* Fluid Dynamics

|}
A Degree in Manufacturing Engineering versus Mechanical Engineering will typically Differ only by a few Specialized Classes. Mechanical Engineering degree focuses more on the Product Design Process and on Complex Products which requires more Mathematics Expertise.

== Manufacturing engineering certification ==

=== Professional engineering license ===
A [[Professional Engineer]], PE,  is a licensed engineer who is permitted to offer professional services to the public. Professional Engineers may prepare, sign, seal, and submit engineering plans to the public. Before a candidate can become a professional engineer, they will need to receive a bachelor's degree from an [[ABET]] recognized university in the USA, take and pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to become an "engineer-in-training", and work four years under the supervision of a professional engineer. After those tasks are complete the candidate will be able to take the PE exam. Upon receiving a passing score on the test, the candidate will receive their PE License .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get Licensed|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/how-get-licensed|website=www.nspe.org|accessdate=21 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) certifications (USA) ===
The [[SME (society)]] administers qualifications specifically for the manufacturing industry. These are not degree level qualifications and are not recognized at the professional engineering level. The SME offers two certifications for Manufacturing engineers: Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) and Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE).

====Certified manufacturing technologist====
Qualified candidates for the Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) must pass a three-hour, 130-question multiple-choice exam. The exam covers math, manufacturing processes, manufacturing management, automation, and related subjects. A score of 60% or higher must be achieved to pass the exam. Additionally, a candidate must have at least four years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience. The CMfgT certification must be renewed every three years in order to stay certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME – Certified Manufacturing Technologist (CMfgT) Certification|url=http://www.sme.org/cmfgt/|website=www.sme.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Certified manufacturing engineer ====
Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) is an engineering qualification administered by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Dearborn, Michigan, USA.  Candidates qualifying for a Certified Manufacturing Engineer credential must pass a four-hour, 180 question multiple-choice exam which covers more in-depth topics than does the CMfgT exam. A score of 60% or higher must be achieved to pass the exam. CMfgE candidates must also have eight years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience, with a minimum of four years of work experience. The CMfgT certification must be renewed every three years in order to stay certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME – Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) Certification|url=http://www.sme.org/cmfge/|website=www.sme.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production (manufacturing) engineering ===

==== Flexible manufacturing systems ====
{{Main|Flexible manufacturing system}}[[File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|thumb|A typical FMS system]]A [[flexible manufacturing system]] (FMS) is a manufacturing system in which there is some amount of flexibility that allows the system to react to changes, whether predicted or unpredicted. This flexibility is generally considered to fall into two categories, both of which have numerous subcategories. The first category, machine flexibility, covers the system's ability to be changed to produce new product types and the ability to change the order of operations executed on a part. The second category, called routing flexibility, consists of the ability to use multiple machines to perform the same operation on a part, as well as the system's ability to absorb large-scale changes, such as in volume, capacity, or capability.

Most FMS systems comprise three main systems. The work machines, which are often automated CNC machines, are connected by a material handling system to optimize parts flow, and to a central control computer, which controls material movements and machine flow. The main advantages of an FMS is its high flexibility in managing manufacturing resources like time and effort in order to manufacture a new product. The best application of an FMS is found in the production of small sets of products from a mass production.

==== Computer integrated manufacturing ====
{{Main|Computer-integrated manufacturing}}

Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) in engineering is a method of manufacturing in which the entire production process is controlled by computer. Traditionally separated process methods are joined through a computer by CIM. This integration allows the processes to exchange information and to initiate actions. Through this integration, manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone, although the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Typically CIM relies on closed-loop control processes based on real-time input from sensors. It is also known as flexible design and manufacturing.

==== Friction stir welding ====
{{Main|Friction stir welding}}[[File:Friction_Stir_Weld.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Friction_Stir_Weld.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a friction stir weld tack tool]]Friction stir welding was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI). This innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins previously un-weldable materials, including several [[aluminum alloys]]. It may play an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include: welding the seams of the aluminum main space shuttle external tank, the Orion Crew Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket; armor plating for amphibious assault ships; and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation, among an increasingly growing range of uses.

=== Industrial engineeing ===
The total number of engineers employed in the US in 2015 was roughly 1.6&amp;nbsp;million. Of these, 272,470 were industrial engineers (16.92%), the third most popular engineering specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#17-0000|title=May 2015 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The median salaries by experience level are $62,000 with 0–5 years experience, $75,000 with 5–10 years experience, and $81,000 with 10–20 years experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Industrial_Engineer/Salary|title=Industrial Engineer Salary|publisher=Payscale|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average starting salaries were $55,067 with a bachelor's degree, $77,364 with a master's degree, and $100,759 with a doctorate degree. This places industrial engineering at 7th of 15 among engineering bachelor's degrees, 3rd of 10 among master's degrees, and 2nd of 7 among doctorate degrees in average annual salary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm#earnings "2010–11 Edition, Engineers"].

=== Production (manufacturing) engineering ===
Manufacturing engineering is just one facet of the engineering industry. Manufacturing engineers enjoy improving the production process from start to finish. They have the ability to keep the whole production process in mind as they focus on a particular portion of the process. Successful students in manufacturing engineering degree programs are inspired by the notion of starting with a natural resource, such as a block of wood, and ending with a usable, valuable product, such as a desk, produced efficiently and economically.

Manufacturing engineers are closely connected with engineering and industrial design efforts. Examples of major companies that employ manufacturing engineers in the United States include General Motors Corporation, [[Ford Motor]] Company, Chrysler, [[Boeing]], Gates Corporation and Pfizer. Examples in Europe include [[Airbus]], Daimler, [[BMW]], Fiat, [[Navistar International]], and Michelin Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Mechanical Engineering Companies to Work For|url=https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/top-mechanical-engineering-companies-work/|website=Engineering Management Institute|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CAD_model_and_CNC_machined_part.PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CAD_model_and_CNC_machined_part.PNG|thumb|CAD model and CNC machined part]]
Many manufacturing companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs, such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[AutoCAD]], into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

[[File:Sw03.jpg|thumb|left|Screen Shot Captured from SolidWorks.]]

===SolidWorks===

[[SolidWorks]] is an example of a CAD modeling computer program developed by [[Dassault Systèmes]]. SolidWorks is an industry standard for drafting designs and specifications for physical objects and has been used by more than 165,000 companies as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZSg7xUj5tg Opening statement by CEO Bertrand Sicot at 2013 Solidworks World] YouTube Video Link.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AutoCAD===

[[AutoCAD]] is an example of a CAD modeling computer program developed by [[Autodesk]]. AutoCad is also widely used for CAD modeling and CAE.&lt;ref name="Lendio"&gt;{{cite web|title= Autodesk, Inc |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Autodesk-Inc-company-History.html| publisher= Lendio | accessdate = 21 April 2018| work =FundingUniverse| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other CAE programs commonly used by product manufacturers include product life cycle management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. There is no need to create a physical prototype until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of relatively few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.

Just as manufacturing engineering is linked with other disciplines, such as mechatronics, [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is also being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.&lt;ref name="MDO" /&gt; MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes by automating the process of trial and error method used by classical engineers. MDO uses a computer based algorithm that will iteratively seek better alternatives from an initial guess within given constants. MDO uses this procedure to determine the best design outcome and lists various options as well.&lt;ref name="MDO"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobieszczanski‐Sobieski|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Morris|first2=Alan|last3=J.L van Tooren|first3=Michel|last4=La Rocca|first4=Gianfranco|last5=Yao|first5=Wen|title=Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Supported by Knowledge Based Engineering|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|isbn=9781118897072|pages=1–2|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781118897072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the engineering project were to design a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the manufacture of the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle or to design the intake system for the engine.

=== Drafting ===
{{Main|Technical drawing|CNC}}
[[File:Mech_2_3D.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mech_2_3D.png|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]]]]
Drafting or [[technical drawing]] is the means by which manufacturers create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or [[draftsman]]. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions. Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Programs such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[AutoCAD]]&lt;ref name="Lendio"/&gt;  are examples of programs used to draft new parts and products under development.

Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings, but this is becoming an increasing rarity with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing. Engineers primarily manufacture parts manually in the areas of applied spray coatings, finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every sub discipline of mechanical and manufacturing engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).

===Metal fabrication and machine tools===
[[Metal fabrication]] is the building of metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling processes. Technologies such as electron beam melting, laser engineered net shape, and direct metal laser sintering has allowed for the production of metal structures to become much less difficult when compared to other conventional metal fabrication methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cansizoglu|first1=Omer|last2=Harrysson|first2=Ola|last3=West|first3=Harvey|last4=Cormier|first4=Denis|last5=Mahale|first5=Tushar|title=Applications of structural optimization in direct metal fabrication|journal=Rapid Prototyping Journal|date=2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=114–122|url=https://doi-org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/10.1108/13552540810862082|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These help to alleviate various issues when the idealized CAD structures do not align with the actual fabricated structure.

[[Machine tool]]s employ many types of tools that do the cutting or shaping of materials. Machine tools usually include many components consisting of motors, levers, arms, pulleys, and other basic simple systems to create a complex system that can build various things. All of these components must work correctly in order to stay on schedule and remain on task. Machine tools aim to efficiently and effectively produce good parts at a quick pace with a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Scott|title=Machine Tools: Design, Reliability and Safety|date=23 January 2012|publisher=Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=9781622572045|page=vii|edition=1st|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncsu/reader.action?ppg=9&amp;docID=3021649&amp;tm=1524351344222|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer integrated manufacturing ===
[[Computer-integrated manufacturing]] (CIM) is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kalpakjian | first = Serope | last2 = Schmid | first2 = Steven | title = Manufacturing engineering and technology | page = 1192 | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | edition = 5th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LRK59pGvDDwC&amp;amp;pg=PA1192 | isbn = 978-7-302-12535-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.&lt;ref name=saracoglu&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-integrated manufacturing allows for data, through various sensing mechanisms to be observed during manufacturing. This type of manufacturing has computers controlling and observing every part of the process. This gives CIM a unique advantage over other manufacturing processes.

=== Mechatronics ===
{{Main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}
[[File:FMS1_small.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FMS1_small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC mill and CNC lathe]]
Mechatronics is an engineering discipline that deals with the convergence of electrical, mechanical and manufacturing systems.&lt;ref name = mech&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Silva|first1=Clarence|title=Mechatronics: Fundamentals and Applications|date=17 November 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4822-3932-4|pages=1–2|edition=1st|url=https://www-taylorfrancis-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/books/e/9781482239324|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various aircraft and automobile subsystems.&lt;ref name = mech /&gt; A mechatronic system typically includes a mechanical skeleton, motors, controllers, sensors, actuators, and digital hardware.&lt;ref name = mech /&gt; Mechatronics is greatly used in various applications of industrial processes and in automation.
The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems, but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]]  (MEMS), are used in automobiles to initiate the deployment of airbags, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high-definition printing. In future it is hoped that such devices will be used in tiny implantable medical devices and to improve optical communication.

=== Textile engineering ===
Textile engineering courses deal with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the design and control of all aspects of fiber, textile, and apparel processes, products, and machinery. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation, and waste and pollution control. Additionally, students are given experience in plant design and layout, machine and wet process design and improvement, and designing and creating textile products. Throughout the textile engineering curriculum, students take classes from other engineering and disciplines including: mechanical, chemical, materials and industrial engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Portal:Textile_engineering|title=Portal:Textile engineering – Wikiversity|website=en.wikiversity.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced composite materials ===
[[Advanced composite materials (engineering)]] (ACMs) are also known as advanced polymer matrix composites. These are generally characterized or determined by unusually high strength fibres with unusually high stiffness, or modulus of elasticity characteristics, compared to other materials, while bound together by weaker matrices.   Advanced composite materials have broad, proven applications, in the aircraft, aerospace, and sports equipment sectors. Even more specifically ACMs are very attractive for aircraft and aerospace structural parts.  Manufacturing ACMs is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. Composite products range from skateboards to components of the space shuttle. The industry can be generally divided into two basic segments, industrial composites and advanced composites.

'''International law''' is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted in relations between [[nation]]s.&lt;ref name="definition – international law"&gt;{{cite web|title=''international law''|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/international+law|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company.|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term was first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his "Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation" in 1780.

National law may become international law when [[treaties]] permit national jurisdiction to [[supranational]] tribunals such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]] or the [[International Criminal Court]]. Treaties such as the [[Geneva Conventions]] may require national law to conform to respective parts.

International law is consent-based governance. This means that a state member may choose to not abide by international law, and even to break its treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue of [[state sovereignty]].  International laws are consent-based. Violations of [[customary international law]] and peremptory norms (''[[Peremptory norm|jus cogens]]'') can lead to wars.

== History ==
{{Main|History of international law}}
[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]] is regarded as the Father of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Thomas E. (Jr.)|title=How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|year=2005|publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89526-038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The current order of international law, the equality of sovereignty between nations, was formed through the conclusion of the "[[Peace of Westphalia]]" in 1648.  Prior to 1648, on the basis of the purpose of war or the legitimacy of war, it sought to distinguish whether the war was a "just war" or not. This theory of power interruptions can also be found in the writings of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Cicero]] and the writings of St. Augustine. According to the theory of armistice, the nation that caused unwarranted war could not enjoy the right to obtain or conquer trophies that were legitimate at the time &lt;ref&gt;Randall Lesaffer, “Too Much History: from War as Sanction to the Sanctioning of War”, in Marc Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th, 18th and 19th centuries saw the growth of the concept of the sovereign "[[nation-state]]", which consisted of a nation controlled by a centralised system of government.  The concept of [[nationalism]] became increasingly important as people began to see themselves as citizens of a particular nation with a distinct national identity.  Until the mid-19th century, relations between nation-states were dictated by treaty, agreements to behave in a certain way towards another state, unenforceable except by force, and not binding except as matters of honor and faithfulness. But treaties alone became increasingly toothless and wars became increasingly destructive, most markedly towards civilians, who decried their horrors, leading to calls for regulation of the acts of states, especially in times of war.

The modern study of international law starts in the early 19th century, but its origins go back at least to the 16th century, and [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Hugo Grotius]], the "fathers of international law."&lt;ref name="Jr.2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Woods Jr.|title=How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYvmAgAAQBAJ|date=18 September 2012|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Incorporated, An Eagle Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-59698-328-1|pages=5, 141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several legal systems developed in [[Europe]], including the codified systems of continental European states and [[English common law]], based on decisions by judges and not by written codes. Other areas developed differing legal systems, with the Chinese legal tradition dating back more than four thousand years, although at the end of the 19th century, there was still no written code for civil proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''China and Her People'', [[Charles Harvey Denby|Charles Denby]], L.

One of the first instruments of modern international law was the [[Lieber Code]], passed in 1863 by the [[Congress of the United States]], to govern the conduct of US forces during the [[United States Civil War]] and considered to be the first written recitation of the rules and articles of war, adhered to by all civilised nations, the precursor of international law. This led to the first prosecution for war crimes—in the case of United States prisoners of war held in cruel and depraved conditions at [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville]], Georgia, in which the Confederate commandant of that camp was tried and hanged, the only Confederate soldier to be punished by death in the aftermath of the entire [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].

In the years that followed, other states subscribed to limitations of their conduct, and numerous other treaties and bodies were created to regulate the conduct of states towards one another in terms of these treaties, including, but not limited to, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1899; the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague]] and [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was passed in 1864; the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1921; the [[Genocide Convention]]; and the [[International Criminal Court]], in the late 1990s. Because international law is a relatively new area of law its development and propriety in applicable areas are often subject to dispute.

== International relations ==
{{Main|Sources of international law|List of ICJ cases}}
Under article 38 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]], international law has three principal sources: international treaties, custom, and general principles of law. In addition, judicial decisions and teachings may be applied as "subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law",

International treaty law comprises obligations states expressly and voluntarily accept between themselves in [[treaty|treaties]]. Customary international law is derived from the consistent practice of States accompanied by ''[[opinio juris]]'', i.e. the conviction of States that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation. Judgments of international tribunals as well as scholarly works have traditionally been looked to as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior. Attempts to codify customary international law picked up momentum after the [[Second World War]] with the formation of the [[International Law Commission]] (ILC), under the aegis of the [[United Nations]]. Codified customary law is made the binding interpretation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty. For states not party to such treaties, the work of the ILC may still be accepted as custom applying to those states. General principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world. Certain norms of international law achieve the binding force of [[peremptory norm]]s (''jus cogens'') as to include all states with no permissible derogations.

*''[[Colombia v Perú]]'' [1950] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1950/6.html ICJ 6], recognising custom as a source of international law, but a practice of giving asylum was not part of it.
*''[[Belgium v Spain]]'' [1970] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1970/1.html ICJ 1], only the state where a corporation is incorporated (not where its major shareholders reside) has standing to bring an action for damages for economic loss.

International law is sourced from decision makers and researchers looking to verify the substantive legal rule governing a legal dispute or academic discourse. The [[sources of international law]] applied by the community of nations to find the content of international law are listed under Article 38.1 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]]: [[Treaties]], customs, and general principles are stated as the three primary sources; and judicial decisions and scholarly writings are expressly designated as the subsidiary sources of international law. Many scholars agree that the fact that the sources are arranged sequentially in the Article 38 of the ICJ Statute suggests an implicit hierarchy of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no concrete evidence, in the decisions of the international courts and tribunals, to support such strict hierarchy, at least when it is about choosing international customs and treaties. In addition, unlike the Article 21 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], which clearly defines hierarchy of applicable law (or sources of international law), the language of the Article 38 do not explicitly support hierarchy of sources.

The sources have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories. During the 20th century, it was recognized by legal [[legal positivism|positivists]] that a [[sovereign state]] could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the principle ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, which was succeeded by the [[United Nations Charter]] and is preserved in the [[United Nations]] Article 7 of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml ''Charter of the United Nations''], United Nations, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS, XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treaties ===
Where there are disputes about the exact meaning and application of national laws, it is the responsibility of the courts to decide what the law means. In international law interpretation is within the domain of the protagonists, but may also be conferred on judicial bodies such as the International Court of Justice, by the terms of the treaties or by consent of the parties. It is generally the responsibility of states to interpret the law for themselves, but the processes of diplomacy and availability of supra-national judicial organs operate routinely to provide assistance to that end.
Insofar as treaties are concerned, the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] writes on the topic of interpretation that:
: "A treaty shall be interpreted in [[good faith]] in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose." (article 31(1))
This is actually a compromise between three different theories of interpretation:
* The textual approach, a restrictive interpretation, which bases itself on the "ordinary meaning" of the text; that approach assigns considerable weight to the actual text.
* The subjective approach, which takes into consideration i. the idea behind the treaty, ii. treaties "in their context", and iii. what the writers intended when they wrote the text.
* A third approach, which bases itself on interpretation "in the light of its object and purpose", i.e. the interpretation that best suits the goal of the treaty, also called "effective interpretation".
These are general rules of interpretation; specific rules might exist in specific areas of international law.

*''[[Greece v United Kingdom]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/1.html ICJ 1], ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear a dispute between the UK government and a private Greek businessman under the terms of a treaty.
*''[[United Kingdom v Iran]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/2.html ICJ 2], the ICJ did not have jurisdiction for a dispute over the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.]] being nationalised.
*''[[Oil Platforms case (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)]]'' [2003] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2003/4.html ICJ 4], rejected dispute over damage to ships which hit a mine.

=== Statehood and responsibility ===
{{See also|Monism and dualism in international law}}
International law establishes the framework and the criteria for identifying [[Sovereign state|states]] as the principal actors in the international legal system. As the existence of a state presupposes control and [[jurisdiction]] over territory, international law deals with the acquisition of territory, [[state immunity]] and the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with each other. International law is similarly concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. There is thus a comprehensive regime dealing with group rights, the treatment of [[alien (law)|aliens]], the rights of [[refugee]]s, [[Transnational crime|international crimes]], [[nationality]] problems, and [[human rights]] generally. It further includes the important functions of the maintenance of international peace and security, arms control, the pacific settlement of disputes and the regulation of the [[use of force]] in international relations. Even when the law is not able to stop the outbreak of war, it has developed principles to govern the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of [[prisoners of war|prisoners]]. International law is also used to govern issues relating to the global environment, the global commons such as [[international waters]] and [[outer space]], global communications, and [[International trade|world trade]].

In theory all states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and equal. As a result of the notion of sovereignty, the value and authority of international law is dependent upon the voluntary participation of states in its formulation, observance, and enforcement. Although there may be exceptions, it is thought by many international academics that most states enter into legal commitments with other states out of [[enlightened self-interest]] rather than adherence to a body of law that is higher than their own. As [[D. W. Greig]] notes, "international law cannot exist in isolation from the political factors operating in the sphere of [[international relations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Greig, D. W., ''International Law'', 2nd edn (Butterworths: London, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[sovereign state]]s and the [[Holy See#Status of the Holy See in international law|Holy See]] were the sole subjects of international law. With the proliferation of [[international organizations]] over the last century, they have in some cases been recognized as relevant parties as well. Recent interpretations of [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], and [[international trade law]] (e.g., [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) Chapter 11 actions) have been inclusive of corporations, and even of certain individuals.

The conflict between international law and national sovereignty is subject to vigorous debate and dispute in academia, diplomacy, and politics. Certainly, there is a growing trend toward judging a state's domestic actions in the light of international law and standards. Numerous people now view the nation-state as the primary unit of international affairs, and believe that only states may choose to voluntarily enter into commitments under international law, and that they have the right to follow their own counsel when it comes to interpretation of their commitments. Certain scholars{{who|date=August 2012}} and political leaders feel that these modern developments endanger nation states by taking power away from state governments and ceding it to international bodies such as the U.N. and the World Bank, argue that international law has evolved to a point where it exists separately from the mere consent of states, and discern a legislative and judicial process to international law that parallels such processes within domestic law.  This especially occurs when states violate or deviate from the expected standards of conduct adhered to by all civilized nations.

A number of states place emphasis on the principle of territorial sovereignty, thus seeing states as having free rein over their internal affairs. Other states oppose this view. One group of opponents of this point of view, including many [[Europe]]an nations, maintain that all civilized nations have certain norms of conduct expected of them, including the prohibition of [[genocide]], [[slavery]] and the [[slave trade]], [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]], [[torture]], and [[piracy]], and that violation of these universal norms represents a crime, not only against the individual victims, but against humanity as a whole. States and individuals who subscribe to this view opine that, in the case of the individual responsible for violation of international law, he "is become, like the [[piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind",&lt;ref&gt;Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furundžija, Page 148 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus subject to prosecution in a fair trial before any fundamentally just tribunal, through the exercise of [[universal jurisdiction]].

Though the European democracies tend to support broad, universalistic interpretations of international law, many other democracies have differing views on international law. Several democracies, including [[India]], [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], take a flexible, eclectic approach, recognizing aspects of international law such as territorial rights as universal, regarding other aspects as arising from treaty or custom, and viewing certain aspects as not being subjects of international law at all. Democracies in the developing world, due to their past colonial histories, often insist on non-interference in their internal affairs, particularly regarding human rights standards or their peculiar institutions, but often strongly support international law at the bilateral and multilateral levels, such as in the United Nations, and especially regarding the use of force, disarmament obligations, and the terms of the UN Charter.

Since international law has no established compulsory [[judicial system]] for the settlement of disputes or a coercive [[penal system]], it is not as straightforward as managing breaches within a domestic legal system. However, there are means by which breaches are brought to the attention of the international community and some means for resolution. For example, there are judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals in international law in certain areas such as trade and human rights. The formation of the [[United Nations]], for example, created a means for the world community to enforce international law upon members that violate its charter through the Security Council.

Since international law exists in a legal environment without an overarching "sovereign" (i.e., an external power able and willing to compel compliance with international norms), "enforcement" of international law is very different from in the domestic context. In many cases, enforcement takes on [[Ronald Coase|Coasian]] characteristics, where the norm is self-enforcing.  In other cases, defection from the norm can pose a real risk, particularly if the international environment is changing.  When this happens, and if enough states (or enough powerful states) continually ignore a particular aspect of international law, the norm may actually change according to concepts of customary international law.  For example, prior to World War I, [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] was considered a violation of international law and ostensibly the [[casus belli]] for the United States' declaration of war against Germany.  By World War II, however, the practice was so widespread that during the [[Nuremberg trials]], the charges against German Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] for ordering unrestricted submarine warfare were dropped, notwithstanding that the activity constituted a clear violation of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.

=== Domestic enforcement ===
Apart from a state's natural inclination to uphold certain norms, the force of international law comes from the pressure that states put upon one another to behave consistently and to honor their obligations. As with any system of law, many violations of international law obligations are overlooked. If addressed, it may be through [[diplomacy]] and the consequences upon an offending state's reputation, submission to international judicial determination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php|title=Home – International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;k=cd&amp;case=1|title=Contentious Cases – International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2194880|title=Arbitral Opinion Relative to the Gold of the National Bank of Albania|date=1 January 1955|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=49|issue=3|pages=403–405|doi=10.2307/2194880}}&lt;/ref&gt; sanctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.aspx|title=Syria Sanctions|website=Treasury.gov|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or force including war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklandswar.org.uk|title=The Falklands Conflict|website=Falkslandswar.org.uk|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though violations may be common in fact, states try to avoid the appearance of having disregarded international obligations. States may also unilaterally adopt sanctions against one another such as the severance of economic or diplomatic ties, or through reciprocal action. In some cases, domestic courts may render judgment against a foreign state (the realm of private international law) for an injury, though this is a complicated area of law where international law intersects with domestic law.

It is implicit in the Westphalian system of nation-states, and explicitly recognized under Article 51 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], that all states have the inherent right to individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against them. Article 51 of the UN Charter guarantees the right of states to defend themselves until (and unless) the Security Council takes measures to keep the peace.

===International bodies===
{{Main|International legal system|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377}}
As a "deliberative, policymaking and representative organ", the [[United Nations General Assembly]] "is empowered to make recommendations"; it can neither codify international law nor make binding resolutions.&lt;ref name="UN_GA-Powers"&gt;{{cite web |title=Functions and powers of the General Assembly |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/about/background.shtml |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_Int-Law"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Law and Justice |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/international-law-and-justice/index.html |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018|date=2016-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merely internal resolutions, such as budgetary matters, may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself. Violations of the UN Charter by members of the United Nations may be raised by the aggrieved state in the General Assembly for debate. 

[[United Nations General Assembly resolution|General Assembly resolution]]s are generally non-binding towards member states, but through its adoption of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|"Uniting for Peace" resolution (A/RES/377 A)]], of 3 November 1950, the Assembly declared that it had the power to authorize the use of force, under the terms of the UN Charter, in cases of breaches of the peace or acts of aggression, provided that the Security Council, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member, fails to act to address the situation. The Assembly also declared, by its adoption of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|resolution 377 A]], that it could call for other collective measures—such as economic and diplomatic sanctions—in situations constituting the milder "threat to the Peace". 

The Uniting for Peace resolution was initiated by the United States in 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], as a means of circumventing possible future Soviet vetoes in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The legal role of the resolution is clear, given that the General Assembly can neighter issue binding resolutions nor codify law. It was never argued by the "Joint Seven-Powers" that put forward the draft resolution,&lt;ref&gt;United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Turkey, Philippines and Uruguay&lt;/ref&gt; during the corresponding discussions, that it in any way afforded the Assembly new powers. Instead, they argued that the resolution simply declared what the Assembly's powers already were, according to the UN Charter, in the case of a dead-locked Security Council.&lt;ref name="UN_APV299"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.299 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=1 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_APV300"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.300 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_APV301"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.301 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_APV302"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.302 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=3 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union was the only permanent member of the Security Council to vote against the Charter interpretations that were made recommendation by the Assembly's adoption of resolution 377 A.

Alleged violations of the Charter can also be raised by states in the Security Council. The Security Council could subsequently pass resolutions under Chapter VI of the UN Charter to recommend the "Pacific Resolution of Disputes." Such resolutions are not binding under international law, though they usually are expressive of the Council's convictions.  In rare cases, the Security Council can adopt resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, related to "threats to Peace, Breaches of the Peace and Acts of Aggression," which are legally binding under international law, and can be followed up with economic sanctions, military action, and similar uses of force through the auspices of the United Nations.

It has been argued that resolutions passed outside of Chapter VII can also be binding; the legal basis for that is the Council's broad powers under Article 24(2), which states that "in discharging these duties (exercise of primary responsibility in international peace and security), it shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations". The mandatory nature of such resolutions was upheld by the [[International Court of Justice]]  (ICJ) in its advisory opinion on [[Namibia]]. The binding nature of such resolutions can be deduced from an interpretation of their language and intent.

States can also, upon mutual consent, submit disputes for arbitration by the [[International Court of Justice]], located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The judgments given by the Court in these cases are binding, although it possesses no means to enforce its rulings.
The Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request. Some of the advisory cases brought before the court have been controversial with respect to the court's competence and jurisdiction.

Often enormously complicated matters, ICJ cases (of which there have been less than 150 since the court was created from the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in 1945) can stretch on for years and generally involve thousands of pages of pleadings, evidence, and the world's leading specialist international lawyers. As of June 2009, there are 15 cases pending at the ICJ. Decisions made through other means of arbitration may be binding or non-binding depending on the nature of the arbitration agreement, whereas decisions resulting from contentious cases argued before the ICJ are always binding on the involved states.

Though states (or increasingly, [[international organizations]]) are usually the only ones with standing to address a violation of international law, some treaties, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] have an optional [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] that allows individuals who have had their rights violated by member states to petition the international [[Human Rights Committee]]. Investment treaties commonly and routinely provide for enforcement by individuals or investing entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://archive.is/20120712220742/http://finlayson.id.au/index.php/practising-law/australia-indonesia-agreements/ | title=Australia Indonesia Treaties}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial agreements of foreigners with sovereign governments may be enforced on the international plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=12836|title=The Sandline Affair Illegality And International Law* - International Law – Australia|website=Mondaq.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International courts===
There are numerous international bodies created by treaties adjudicating on legal issues where they may have jurisdiction. The only one claiming [[universal jurisdiction]] is the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Others are: the United Nations [[International Court of Justice]], and the [[International Criminal Court]] (when national systems have totally failed and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Treaty of Rome]] is applicable) and the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].

The Andean Community of Nations is the first attempt to integrate the countries of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. It started with the Cartagena Agreement of 26 May 1969, and consists of four countries: [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The Andean Community follows supranational laws, called Agreements, which are mandatory for these countries.

==International legal theory==
{{Main|International legal theories}}
International legal theory comprises a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches used to explain and analyse the content, formation and effectiveness of international law and institutions and to suggest improvements. Some approaches center on the question of compliance: why states follow international norms in the absence of a coercitive power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international law norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature; while other perspectives are policy oriented: they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing norms and to make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic [[legal theory]], some are [[interdisciplinary]], and others have been developed expressly to analyse international law. Classical approaches to International legal theory are the [[Natural law]], the Eclectic and the [[Legal positivism]] schools of thought.

The [[natural law]] approach argues that international norms should be based on [[axiomatic]] truths. 16th-century natural law writer, [[Francisco de Vitoria]], a professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Salamanca]], examined the questions of the [[just war]], the Spanish authority in the [[Americas]], and the rights of the Native American peoples.

In 1625 [[Hugo Grotius]] argued that nations as well as persons ought to be governed by universal principle based on [[morality]] and [[Divine retribution|divine justice]] while the relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the ''[[jus gentium]]'', established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'', that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, [[Emmerich de Vattel]] argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th-century natural law and suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other. During the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, territorial sovereignty, and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]].

The early [[legal positivism|positivist]] school emphasized the importance of custom and treaties as sources of international law. 16th-century [[Alberico Gentili]] used historical examples to posit that positive law (''jus voluntarium'') was determined by general consent. [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]] asserted that the bases of international law were customs and treaties commonly consented to by various states, while [[John Jacob Moser]] emphasized the importance of state practice in international law. The positivism school narrowed the range of international practice that might qualify as law, favouring [[rationality]] over [[morality]] and [[ethic]]s. The 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] marked the formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe.

Modern legal positivists consider international law as a unified system of rules that emanates from the states' will. International law, as it is, is an "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]" reality that needs to be distinguished from law "as it should be." Classic positivism demands rigorous tests for [[law|legal]] [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and it deems irrelevant all extralegal arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Simma]] and Andreas L.Paulus "Symposium on method in International Law: The Responsibility of Individuals for Human Rights Abuses in Internal Conflicts: A Positivist View" 93 American Journal of International Law 302  (April, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term "international law" is sometimes divided into "public" and "private" international law, particularly by civil law scholars, who seek to follow a Roman tradition.&lt;ref&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the relationship between different branches of international law. {{cite journal|last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law? Postmodern Anxieties|journal=Leiden Journal of International Law|date=September 2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=553–579|doi=10.1017/S0922156502000262|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156502000262|accessdate=30 January 2015}} {{cite journal|last1=Yun|first1=Seira|title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law – The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|date=2014|volume=5|issue=1–2|pages=213–257|ssrn=2556825|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman lawyers would have further distinguished ''[[jus gentium]]'', the law of nations, and ''[[jus inter gentes]]'' – agreements between nations. On this view, "public" international law is said to cover relations between nation-states, and includes fields such as [[treaty law]], [[law of sea]], [[international criminal law]], the [[laws of war]] or [[international humanitarian law]], [[international human rights law]], and [[refugee law]]. By contrast "private" international law, which is more commonly termed "[[conflict of laws]]", concerns whether courts within countries claim jurisdiction over cases with a foreign element, and which country's law applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/private_international_law.asp| title=Private International Law|website=Oas.org|accessdate=27 December 2017| date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further concept, more recently developing, is of "[[supranational law]]", on the law of [[supranational]] organizations. This concerns regional agreements where the laws of nation states may be held inapplicable when conflicting with a supranational legal system when that nation has a [[treaty]] obligation to a supranational [[collective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/883/the-sovereignty-of-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-eus-supranational-legal-system|author=Kolcak, Hakan|title=The Sovereignty of the European Court of Justice and the EU's Supranational Legal System|website=Inquiriesjournal.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of "supranational law" arise when nations explicitly cede their right to make certain judicial decisions to a common tribunal.&lt;ref name="Degan1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Degan|first=Vladimir Đuro|title=Sources of International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0pTp1qCc9UC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=1997-05-21|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789041104212|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decisions of the common tribunal are directly effective in each party nation, and have priority over decisions taken by national courts.&lt;ref name="Blanpain2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanpain|first=Roger|title=Comparative Labour Law and Industrial Relations in Industrialized Market Economies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahaoKRbqPdMC&amp;pg=PA410|accessdate=5 December 2015|year=2010|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041133489|pages=410 n.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] is an example of an international treaty organization which implements a supranational legal framework, with the [[European Court of Justice]] having supremacy over all member-nation courts in matter of [[European Union law]]. A further frequently used term is "transnational law", which refers to a body of rules that transcend the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotterrell|first=Roger|date=2012-03-01|title=What Is Transnational Law?|journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=500–524|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.2012.01306.x|issn=1747-4469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Nation-states observe the principle of {{lang-la|[[par in parem non habet imperium]]|lit=Between equals there is no sovereign power|label=none}}. [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]] therefore asserted that 'so-called' international law, lacking a sovereign power and so unenforceable, was not really law at all, but 'positive morality', consisting of 'opinions and sentiments...more ethical than legal in nature.' &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;James B Scott, "The legal nature of international law", ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', vol 5 no 2, Feb 1905, p 128-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 (1) of the [[UN Charter]] confirms this Sovereignty of Nations; no state is in subjection to any other state.

Also, since the bulk of international law is treaty law, binding only on signatories, then; &lt;blockquote&gt; 'If legislation is the making of laws by a person or assembly  binding on the whole community, there is no such thing as international law. For treaties bind only those who sign them.' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since states are few in number, diverse and atypical in character, unindictable, lacking a centralised sovereign power, and their agreements unpoliced and decentralised,&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Wight, power politics, p 109&lt;/ref&gt; then, says Wight, 'international society is not a society at all. The condition of international relations is best described as international anarchy;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 'While in domestic politics the struggle for power is governed and circumscribed by law, in international politics, law is governed and circumscribed by the struggle for power. (This is why) international politics is called [[power politics]]... War is the only means by which states can in the last resort defend vital interests...the causes of war are inherent in power politics.' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the subject of treaty law, [[Charles de Gaulle]] said this; 'Treaties are like pretty girls, or roses; they last only as long as they last.' &lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;speech, 2/7/1963; [[Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]], OUP 1999, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Hans Morgenthau]], international law is the weakest and most primitive system of law enforcement. Its decentralised nature makes it similar to the law that prevails in preliterate tribal societies.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Morgenthau, Politics among nations, fifth edition, Knopf, 1976, p273&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Monopoly on violence]] is what makes domestic law enforceable; but between nations, there are multiple competing sources of force.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;ibid, p273-4&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion created by treaty laws, which resemble private contracts between persons, is mitigated only by the relatively small number of states.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;ibid, p 275&lt;/ref&gt; On the vital subject of war, it is unclear whether the [[Nuremberg trials]] created new law, or applied the existing law of the [[Kellogg-Briand pact]].

Morgenthau asserts that no state may be compelled to submit a dispute to an international tribunal, making laws unenforceable and voluntary.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;ibid, p281&lt;/ref&gt; International law is also unpoliced, lacking agencies for enforcement.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;ibid, p 289&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a 1947 US opinion poll in which 75% of respondents wanted 'an international police to maintain world peace'; but only 13% wanted that force to exceed the US armed forces. Later surveys have produced similar contradictory results.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;ibid, p 324&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">'''Julio Carrizosa Mutis''' is a Colombian businessman active  in the construction and financial sectors in [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/termodorada/33836-3|title=TERMODORADA|last=Semana|website=TERMODORADA|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Career ==
Carrizosa started his business career in the construction industry. He founded the company Industrial de Construcciones in the city of [[Bucaramanga]]. He became a major contractorforf the public entity known as Land Loans Institute ([[Instituto de Credito Territorial]]), which controlled the construction industry. He specialized in the construction of low-cost housing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1980s, Carrizosa became the major shareholder of [[Granahorrar Bank]] and an investor in other financial institutions such as Davivienda and Ahorramás. Construction and housing credits (mortgages) became the bank's core businesses. The housing policy of the former President [[Belisario Betancur]] helped boost the bank's success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-789127|title=EL HOMBRE DE GRANAHORRAR|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|website=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988 to 1998, the bank showed a real annual growth rate of 45%.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/pelea-de-socios/34888-3|title=PELEA DE SOCIOS|last=Semana|website=PELEA DE SOCIOS, Sección Economía, edición 815, Jan 12 1998|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granahorrar Bank was part of a conglomerate called Grupo Grancolombiano which also owned Banco de Colombia, Colombia’s largest bank. In 1998, the country experienced a financial crisis, and, the Colombian government seized ownership of (expropriated) the bank from Carrizosa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Granahorrar was expropriated in 1998 as part of the economic policies executed by the Government to mitigate the financial crisis; it was the only bank expropriated without compensation. On October 31, 2005, the government sold the bank to the Spanish Bank [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-2735668|title=Carrizosa, el ganador detrás de Granahorrar|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|website=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International fight ===
As of September 2018, the Carrizosa family and the Colombian government are fighting over the government's 1998 expropriation of the bank before the United Nations Commission for International Commercial Law (UNCITRAL) in The Hague, Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://flbusinessdaily.com/stories/511554673-panel-considers-colombia-s-illicit-use-of-regulatory-authority-in-seizure-of-bank|title=Panel considers Colombia’s “illicit use of regulatory authority” in seizure of bank|last=|first=|date=2018-09-05|work=Florida Business Daily|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute is whether the Colombian government overstepped its boundaries and used expropriation as a political weapon, in violation of international trade treaties, in seizing the bank and then selling it for a profit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Carrizosa family alleges that in 1998, then-President [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andres Pastrana]] targeted Granahorrar Bank for seizure for political reasons because Carrizosa had made political donations to the opposite political party.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The Carrizosa family says that their bank was among the strongest in Colombia at the time it was seized by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A court ordered the government to compensate the Carrizosa family, but the government did not pay because it claimed it didn't have "several hundred million dollars."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The government appealed to overturn the verdict and won. Therefore, the Carrizosa family turned to international arbitration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Carrizosa is from the city of Bucaramanga, Santander. He is married to Astrida Benita; together they have three sons, Alberto, Enrique and Felipe Carrizosa. Astrida was born in Latvia and emigrated to the United States after [[World War II]]. All three sons have dual Colombian-American citizenship.

'''Kevin Bermeister''' has developed several businesses in the computer, multimedia and Internet industries.

He is a technology innovator, real estate investor, philanthropist, and the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Brilliant Digital Entertainment Inc. (BDE),.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brilliantdigital.com&lt;/ref&gt; Bermeister is a founding investor in a number of successful technology and real estate ventures including [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-news/company-sale-took-the-fun-out/story-e6freuzi-1226355284968&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Bermeister established [[Namco Bandai Partners|Ozisoft]], one of the first interactive multimedia companies. By 1990, Ozisoft was Australia's largest [[Computer and video games|video games]] distributor. In 1992, Bermeister and [[Mark Dyne]] successfully led a management buyout, together with [[Sega]] Enterprises, to form [[Namco Bandai Partners|Sega Ozisoft Pty Limited]] representing exclusively the world's largest video game publisher.

In 1994, Bermeister and his property consortium Jacfun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sega-world-says-it-was-deceived-over-office-space-20110221-1b2o5.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=22 February 2011 | title=Sega World says it was deceived over office space}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiated rights to property at Sydney's [[Darling Harbour]] and established the interactive [[Sega World Sydney]] amusement park, operated through a joint venture including shareholders Sega Enterprises Japan, [[Mitsubishi]] Corp. and [[Mitsui]] Corp.

In 2003 Altnet, using its distributed storage technology, became the largest provider of secure DRM content, having distributed 75 million licensed files to users of various P2P file sharing software applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Altnet-to-pay-Kazaa-users-for-swapping/2100-1025_3-1011827.html |title=Altnet To Pay Kazaa Users For Swapping |publisher=CNET News |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another initiative undertaken by Altnet under Bermeister's stewardship is Global File Registry,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalfileregistry.com&lt;/ref&gt; which enables governments and copyright owners to police the distribution of illegal or infringing material over distributed systems and the Internet.

In 2006 BDE, Altnet and Kazaa settled major litigation with leading music and motion picture industry plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian copyright law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Bermeister has focused on building and acquiring content, technology and distribution assets for BDE.

Kinetech's patent and technology portfolio is often referred to as the True Name Patent Portfolio.

In 2008, BDE acquired the Kazaa Trademark and relaunched Kazaa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/music-entertainment/272066-kazaa-relaunches-as-licensed-service |title=Kazaa Relaunches as Licensed Service |publisher=PCMag |accessdate=20 December 2011 |first=Mark |last=Hachman}}&lt;/ref&gt; with music licenses from major music labels Universal, Sony, Warner Music Group and EMI, major independent record labels, and leading music publishers.

'''Market abolitionism''' is a belief that [[Market system|the market]], in the economic sense, should be completely eliminated from society. Market abolitionists argue that markets are [[ethics|ethically]] abhorrent, [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]], and fundamentally incompatible with long term [[human]] and [[environmental]] survival.

In large countries in the modern world, the only significant alternative to a market economy has been [[central planning]] as was practiced in the early [[USSR]] and in the [[People's Republic of China]] before the 1990s. Other proposed alternatives to the [[market economy]] &amp;mdash;participatory planning as proposed in the theory of [[participatory economics]] ("Parecon"), an "[[artificial market]]" as proposed by advocates of [[Inclusive Democracy]], and the idea of substituting a [[gift economy]] for a [[Commodity markets|commodity exchange]]&amp;mdash;have not yet been tried on a large scale in the modern industrialized world, though alternative organizational methods have been implemented successfully during short periods of time: the early stages of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] before it was taken over by the [[Bolsheviks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rocker|first=Rudolf |authorlink= Rudolf Rocker |title= Anarcho syndicalism: Theory and Practice |year=2004 |publisher=[[AK Press]] |isbn=  |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berkman|first=Alexander|authorlink= Alexander Berkman |title= The ABC of Anarchism |year=2003 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=  |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Notes on Anarchism|author=[[Noam Chomsky]] |url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|publisher=In Daniel Guérin, Anarchism: From Theory to Practice, 1970; chomsky.info| accessdate= 2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] before it was crushed by the alliance of [[liberalism|liberal]]s and [[communist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |title= Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship |year=2003 |publisher=[[The New Press]] |isbn=  |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
[[Michael Albert]], creator of [[Znet]] and co-creator of participatory economics, considers himself a market abolitionist and favors democratic participatory planning as a replacement. He and several colleagues, including [[Robin Hahnel]] have elaborated their theory of "parecon" in books, on Znet, and in ''[[Z Magazine]]''.

Notably, [[Noam Chomsky]] is one of those who have expressed the opinion that a truly free market (in the context of a sudden transition from the current system) would destroy the species as well as physical environment. He also favors a democratic participatory planning process as a replacement to the market.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194522/http://www.chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3]

==Criticisms==
Economists such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Brink Lindsey]] argue that if the market is eliminated along with property, prices, and wages, then the mode of information transmission is eliminated and what will result is a highly inefficient system for transmitting the value, supply, demand, of goods, services, resources, along with an elimination of the most efficient mode of market transactions. Opinions as to what would follow range from the total collapse of civilization and mass starvation&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/daily/2197&lt;/ref&gt; to mere inefficient allocation.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Caplan's short critique of economic calculation problem as posed by the [[Austrian school]] (among other things): http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Market abolitionists may reply that whilst advocates of the Austrian school recognize equilibrium prices do not exist, they nonetheless claim that these prices can be used as a rational basis whilst this is not the case, hence markets are not efficient.&lt;ref&gt;http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secI1.html#seci12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secI1.html#seci15&lt;/ref&gt;

"Contemporary" [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] like [[Kevin Carson]] (as opposed to "classical" mutualists such [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]) advocate a form of mutualism termed "Free Market Socialism" (which is not the same as [[Market Socialism]]) as an alternative to both Capitalism and State Socialism, noting that a decentralized system can be self-regulating.

'''Martin Shanahan''' (born 1973) is the CEO of [[IDA Ireland]], the Irish State agency responsible for attracting inward foreign direct investment to Ireland.

==Early Career==

Prior to becoming CEO of [[IDA Ireland]], Shanahan worked from 2005-2014 in [[Forfás]], an Irish state-funded policy agency which advised government on enterprise, trade, science, technology, and innovation with a staff of 90.&lt;ref name="idaireland.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/ida-ireland-announces-app/|title=Press release: IDA Ireland Announces Appointment of new CEO, Martin Shanahan|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/forfas-chief-martin-shanahan-to-replace-oleary-at-ida-30340769.html|publisher=Irish Independent|date=10 June 2014|title=Forfas chief Martin Shanahan to replace O'Leary at IDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://merrionstreet.ie/en/Category-Index/Economy/Jobs/government-plan-for-20000-new-manufacturing-jobs-by-2016-minister-bruton-minister-quinn.html | title=Government plan for 20,000 new manufacturing jobs by 2016 – Minister Bruton, Minister Quinn | author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | date=22 April 2013 | website=merrionstreet.ie | publisher=Irish Government News Service | access-date=30 October 2018 | quote=Forfás is Ireland’s policy advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shanahan worked in a number of [[Forfás]] roles before becoming CEO of the policy unit in 2010.&lt;ref name="idaireland.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Forfas was dissolved in 2014, as part of the then Government's commitment to reducing the number of Irish State [[quangos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/quango-cull-results-in-just-17-fewer-agencies-1.2929549|title=‘Quango cull’ results in just 17 fewer agencies Fine Gael had listed 145 quangos which would be terminated when it got into power||publisher=Irish Times|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its functions were transferred to the [[Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation|Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]], [[Enterprise Ireland]], the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]] and the [[Health and Safety Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act | title=Industrial Development (Forfás Dissolution) Act | language=English |date=2014 | url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/13/enacted/en/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dut"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/forf%C3%A1s-to-be-abolished-1.1636069|title=Forfás to be abolished|quote=[[Richard Bruton]], the responsible Minister, received Cabinet approval last Tuesday for the move to dissolve the quango, which has a staff of about 90.

According to his resume, Shanahan worked in some private Irish hotels (e.g. Sinnott Hotels).&lt;ref name="idaireland.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/ireland-s-trusted-adviser-1.672837|title=IDA New CEO: Ireland's trusted adviser|quote=Martin Shanahan may, as yet, hardly be a household name but we will be hearing a lot more from this 41-year-old former hotelier in the years to come, following his appointment as chief executive-designate of the IDA.|publisher=Irish Times|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/idas-shanahan-we-dont-have-natural-resources-other-than-the-quality-of-our-people-34526245.html|title=IDA's Shanahan: 'We don't have natural resources other than the quality of our people'|quote=Shanahan is part politician, part diplomat, and part salesman.|publisher=Irish Independent|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CEO IDA Ireland==
Shanahan took up the position of CEO of IDA Ireland on the 1 September 2014.&lt;ref name="ir"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/news/martin-set-to-take-up-the-mantle-272253.html|title=Martin set to take up the mantle|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1027809.shtml|title=We wish Martin Shanahan - new IDA Ireland chief - well but...|quote=We wish him well but with reservations as both he and the chairman of what is a key public agency, are both insiders in a system in recent decades where ministers hone the enterprise policy making message for political impact while dissent, at least in public, is as rare as a black swan.|publisher=FinFacts|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role was described by journalist Colm Kelpie as "part politician, part diplomat, and part salesman".&lt;ref name="itr"/&gt;  Shanahan has highlighted Ireland's talent, and the quality of third level education system in particular, as the reason why Ireland has been so popular with multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macgillsummerschool.com/martin-d-shanahan/|title=With developments in the USA and the UK, the threats to Ireland's economy have increased|last=Shanahan|first=Martin D.|date=|website=McGill Summer School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major events===
The first major event to occur during Shanahan's tenure as IDA CEO was [[Brexit]].  Shanahan was quoted as saying Brexit was likely to be a net positive for IDA Ireland in terms of attracting companies (both UK and non-UK) to Ireland as a base for selling into the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ida-confident-of-winning-brexit-jobs-as-firms-exit-uk-1.3144097?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fida-confident-of-winning-brexit-jobs-as-firms-exit-uk-1.3144097|title=IDA confident of winning Brexit jobs as firms exit UK|publisher=Irish Times|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/brexit-silver-lining-to-bring-2500-jobs-here-over-five-years-says-ida-36743348.html|title=A Brexit "silver lining" will deliver 2,500 new jobs for Ireland over the next three to five years, IDA boss Martin Shanahan has claimed.|publisher=Irish Independent|date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/uks-difficulty-is-irelands-fdi-opportunity-says-shanahan-36526903.html|title=UK's difficulty is Ireland's FDI opportunity, says Shanahan|publisher=Irish Independent|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In June 2017 Shanahan was criticized for filling only one of ten positions that his office had been given to hire people to attract companies to Ireland that were leaving the UK due to Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/ida-takes-on-just-one-of-10-allowed-extra-brexit-staff-35768384.html|title=IDA takes on just one of 10 allowed extra Brexit staff|publisher=Irish Independent|quote=The IDA has so far managed to recruit just one of the 10 extra "Brexit" staff for which it received approval from the Government.|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In October 2017 and again in January 2018 Shanahan testified before the [[Public Accounts Committee (Ireland)|Public Accounts Committee]] that Ireland needed to improve the affordability of its housing and its infrastructure, particularly broadband internet access, to remain competitive in attracting foreign companies; he also said that while companies in the financial industry were considering moving from the UK to Ireland due to Brexit, the loss of access to the UK for companies that depend on it for sales or supplies could harm Irish companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ida-warns-of-need-to-do-more-to-maintain-competitiveness-1.3245354|title=IDA warns of need to do more to maintain competitiveness|publisher=Irish Times|quote=Head of State body says action needed on housing, broadband and infrastructure|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b4e15282-d44f-11e7-ae3e-563c04c5339a|title=Tight property supply constrains Dublin’s Brexit appeal: Escalating prices and rents prompt anxiety about ability to draw more business|publisher=Financial Times|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2017 several major financial firms based in the UK had chosen to go to Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels, or Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/disappointing-number-of-financials-plan-to-come-to-dublin-post-brexit-1.3327469?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Ffinancial-services%2Fdisappointing-number-of-financials-plan-to-come-to-dublin-post-brexit-1.3327469|title=Disappointing number of financials plan to come to Dublin post-Brexit|publisher=Irish Times|quote=Transfers from London mainly going to Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels and Paris|date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2018 Shanahan reported that no new jobs had been created in Ireland due to Brexit and that he expected to see the outcome of his office's efforts at the end of 2018 or the beginning of 2019.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/brexit-bounce-yet-to-come-as-trump-tax-moves-change-little-ida-says-1.3344807|title=Brexit bounce yet to come as Trump tax moves change little, IDA says|publisher=Irish Times|date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By June 2018 companies opting to go elsewhere had caused Ireland to fall out of the top 10 rankings for European financial firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-falls-in-fdi-ranking-as-paris-gains-to-londons-cost-36998956.html|title=Ireland falls in FDI ranking as Paris gains to London's cost|publisher=Irish Independent|quote=Ireland fell out of a top 10 ranking of the most attractive European destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI) last year, slipping to 11th place overall after being overtaken by Finland.|date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-brexit-bankers/|title=Frankfurt Is the Big Winner in Battle for Brexit Bankers|publisher=Bloomberg News|quote=Frankfurt has emerged as the biggest winner in the fight for thousands of London-based jobs that will have to be relocated to new hubs inside the European Union after Brexit.|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major event was the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (or TCJA) which changes the tax structure for U.S. multinationals in Ireland. Shanahan was initially relaxed about the TCJA noting Ireland's "headline" corporate tax rate of 12.5% was competitive against the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trumps-tax-plan-seeks-to-bring-american-business-back-home-but-low-tax-ireland-isnt-very-worried/2017/12/13/8b8124f0-def2-11e7-bbd0-9dfb2e37492a_story.html|quote=Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the government agency tasked with securing foreign investment, said that American companies are being guided by market principles, "trying to acquire talent, trying to build global teams."

During the Irish [[Irish constitutional referendums, 2015|Same-sex marriage referendum in 2015]], Shanahan stated that a 'Yes' vote would be in the State's economic interest and that a 'No' vote would send a negative message to the international business community (Ireland's largest company is Apple).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/martin-shanahan-a-yes-vote-is-good-for-business-1.2195614|title=Martin Shanahan: 'A Yes vote is good for business'|publisher=Irish Times|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His interview drew praise and criticism with some questioning if he had over-stepped his position, as Shanahan himself is gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/revealed-ida-chief-in-row-over-gay-marriage-call-31352227.html|title=Revealed: IDA chief in row over gay marriage call|publisher=Irish Independent|quote=Senior executive gobsmacked by Shanahan's email stating a Yes vote is good for business|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ida-martin-shanahan-yes-vote-2079921-May2015/|title=IDA boss didn't talk to the government before calling for a Yes vote|publisher=Journal.ie|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mats Qviberg''' (born 1953 in [[Stockholm]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] businessman. Together with his close business partner [[Sven Hagströmer]], Qviberg is in control of a group of companies which include [[Hagströmer &amp; Qviberg]] and [[Investment AB Öresund]].

==Youth and Education==
Mats Qviberg was born in central Stockholm. His father worked at a factory owned by [[General Motors]]. Qviberg went to school in [[Bromma]] outside the city centre and completed his military service in [[Strängnäs]].

He graduated with a degree in business from [[Stockholm School of Economics]].

==Early career==
Qviberg started his career with Swedish bank [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken|SEB]], where he became a [[stockbroker]] in 1981. He was incredibly successful and in 1984 he joined [[Carnegie Investment Bank]], a major player on the Swedish financial markets.

==Hagströmer &amp; Qviberg==
In 1990, Qviberg became a partner in Hagströmer's company and it was renamed to reflect that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.se/sv/Om-HQ/Historik/ HQ Bank: Historik], accessed on April 26, 2010 {{sv icon}}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410030705/http://www.hq.se/sv/Om-HQ/Historik/ |date=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Hagströmer, Qviberg built a financial empire beginning with the acquisition of [[Investment AB Öresund]] in 1992. Through partly unconventional methods many companies were taken over, sometimes upsetting traditionalist Swedish businessmen like [[Percy Barnevik]]. Barnevik served on the Board of Directors of [[AB Custos]], an ancient investment company, which Qviberg and Hagströmer gradually took over.

Today, he control a number of companies. Qviberg is the Chairman of Öresund.

At the end of August 2010, it turned out that HQ Bank didn't have enough money to operate as a bank according to Swedish law, due to risky and failed speculation at the internal trading department at the bank. Sunday the 29th of August 2010, the Swedish "Finance Inspection" (FI, Finansinspektionen) withdrew their permission to operate as a bank. The bank was closed for several days after the 29th. According to Swedish media, approximately 900 customers had money on their accounts which exceeded the Swedish bank guarantee of 500,000 SEK. A report written by FI says that HQ Bank's department for risk control had a weak position at the bank.

==Political Views==
Mats Qviberg has been known to make comments on current affairs. He has defined himself as ''allmänborgerlig'', which means he is a supporter of Sweden's [[Alliance (Sweden)|centre-right parties]].

He caused some controversy during the campaign preceding the [[Referenda in Sweden|referendum on the Euro]] in 2003. He first came out in support of the [[Euro]], even taking part in advertisements for [[Sweden in Europe]]. Meanwhile, Sven Hagströmer was an outspoken opponent of the euro. Close to the referendum, Qviberg changed his mind and joined the no side. When [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Göran Persson]] was asked to comment upon Qviberg's defection, Persson claimed that he did not know who Qviberg was. Qviberg replied by saying that Persson was a [[bullying|bully]] and that he was probably lying.

In early 2006, Qviberg drew attention to himself again by writing a series of articles in ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' attacking the trend of [[corporate social responsibility]] and stated [[Ayn Rand]] as a major inspiration for his own ethics.

In late 2010, Qviberg again drew attention to himself after saying that he won't vote for the Christian Democrats (KD), which he claims to have done in the past. The reason for not voting on KD in the September 2010 election would, according to Mr Qviberg, be that the minister of the finance markets (who is a Christian Democrat) had made a statement that it was correct to withdraw the permission for HQ to operate as a bank.

==Personal==
He lives with his wife in [[Lidingö]]. He is the second richest individual in that municipality. His son, Johan, sits on the Board of Directors of one of the companies which Qviberg is connected to. His other children are Anna and Jacob, Jacob being the youngest.

Kelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]].

The '''Faculty of Business and Economics''' at [[Monash University]], [[Melbourne]] is the largest university faculty in [[Australia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It is home to over 16,000 students and staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/about/ About Business and Economics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In teaching, it offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees.

The Faculty's teaching and research are spread across most of Monash University's campuses, including Clayton, Caulfield, Malaysia, Gippsland, Peninsula, Berwick, South Africa and Prato. The Interim Dean of the Faculty is Professor Rob Brooks.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

The current Faculty structure is the result of the amalgamation of the Monash University Faculty of Economics, based at the University's Clayton Campus, and the David Syme School of Business, based at what is now the University's Caulfield Campus. Traditionally, the Clayton Campus was strong in economic research, but underperformed in industry training. Conversely, the David Syme School was one of Australia's leading business schools in professional training, but lacked a strong research base. The early 1990s merger, though opposed by some at the time, was seen as a way to bring together these parallel areas of expertise.

==MBA program==
Monash is one of only three MBA programs in Australia to have accreditation by the London-based [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mba.monash.edu.au/profile/accreditation.html Monash MBA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828225430/http://www.mba.monash.edu.au/profile/accreditation.html |date=2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''occupational exposure limit''' is an upper limit on the acceptable [[concentration]] of a [[hazardous substance]] in workplace [[air]] for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect [[occupational safety and health]]. It is an important tool in [[risk assessment]] and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work | title=Occupational Exposure Limits | url=http://osha.europa.eu/good_practice/topics/dangerous_substances/oel | accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or [[control banding]] strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.

== Background ==
[[File:Hierarchies of Exposure Assessment and Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]

Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) have been established for airborne workplace chemicals by multiple regulatory and authoritative organizations around the world for well over 60 years now.  With the changing regulatory arena, shifting centers of manufacturing growth, and the move towards a more global view on occupational hygiene issues, it is important for the [[Occupational hygiene|Occupational Hygiene]] profession to understand the current and growing issues impacting the continued viability of OEL’s in our professional practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IOHA | title=International OEL Issues and Activities \ | url=http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | archivedate=2015-08-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are preferred for establishing safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, the lack of publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers.  Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often on the front line of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values.  In the absence of OELs however, there are a variety of tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers.  The "Hierarchy of OELs" provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=AIHA | title=Webinar:  The New Era of Global Exposure Limit Setting Processes - Harmonization on an OEL Hierarchy Approach |url=http://www.aiha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hierarchy of Occupational Exposure Limits.JPG|thumb|Hierarchy of occupational exposure limits (OELs)]]
[[File:Analysis of air sampling data using IHSTAT.JPG|thumb|Illustration of statistical output from IHSTAT using air sampling data]]
Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable.  These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods.  These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical tools are available to assess exposure monitoring data against OELs.  The statistical tools are typically free but do require some previous knowledge with statistical concepts.  A popular exposure data statistical tool called "IH STAT" is available from AIHA ([[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]).  IHSTAT has 14 languages including English and is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;"Link to freeware version IHSTAT via AIHA Exposure Assessment Strategies website" https://www.aiha.org/get-involved/VolunteerGroups/Pages/Exposure-Assessment-Strategies-Committee.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H.

==Types==
* [[Permissible exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]
* [[Recommended exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]
* [[Indicative limit value]], set by the European Union
* [[Threshold Limit Value|Threshold limit value]], set by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]]
* [[Occupational exposure banding]], a process that can be used when not enough data are available to determine quantiative exposure limits

The [[database]] ″GESTIS - International limit values for chemical agents″&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance: GESTIS – International limit values for chemical agents (Occupational exposure limits, OELs), http://www.dguv.de/ifa/gestis/gestis-internationale-grenzwerte-fuer-chemische-substanzen-limit-values-for-chemical-agents/index-2.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; contains a collection of occupational limit values for hazardous substances collected from over 30 countries: various [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[China]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]]. The database comprises values of more than 2,000 substances.

The present database was elaborated in co-operation with experts from various international [[occupational safety and health]] institutions. It aims to give an overview of limit values in different countries. Since the limit values vary in their handling, the level of protection, and their legal relevance, the original lists of limit values and the explanations there should be considered as primary sources. Also the [[chemical nomenclature]] is diverging, [[synonym]]s can for example be found in the [[GESTIS Substance Database]].

The database is also available as app for mobile terminals with Android or iOS operating systems.

'''Pranknet''', also known as '''Prank University''',&lt;ref name="elderlyman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/elderly-man-falls-victim-motel-6-prank|title=Elderly Man Falls Victim To Motel 6 Prank|date=23 November 2010|work=[[The Smoking Gun]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an infamous Canadian-based anonymous [[prank call]]ing [[virtual community]] responsible for damage to [[hotel]]s and [[fast food restaurant]]s of more than $60,000 as well as multiple instances of telephone harassment. It was founded by a man who later referred to himself as "Dex1x1" (alleged to be a Canadian man named Tariq Malik&lt;ref name="tsgtt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/telephone-terrorist|title=Telephone Terrorist|date=August 4, 2010|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="logcab"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lamb |first=Joe |author2-link=|title=CPD investigating prank call |newspaper=The Log Cabin Democrat |date=June 12, 2009 |url=http://thecabin.net/stories/061209/loc_0612090003.shtml#.WAFGuOArLIU}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="qsr"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hoyland |first=Christa |title=FBI investigating incidents of QSR phone-in vandalism |newspaper=QSRweb |date=July 14, 2009 |url=http://www.qsrweb.com/news/fbi-investigating-incidents-of-qsr-phone-in-vandalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been linked to nearly 60 separate incidents.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{Citation|title=Ontario man accused of mass online pranks|publisher=CBC News|date=August 6, 2009|url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/08/05/ont-online-prankster523.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809193606/http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/08/05/ont-online-prankster523.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 9, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posing as [[Authority|authority figures]], such as [[fire alarm]] company representatives and hotel front-desk/corporate managers, Pranknet participants called unsuspecting employees and customers in the [[United States]] and tricked them into damaging property, setting off [[fire sprinkler]]s, breaking out windows, and other humiliating acts such as disrobing and consumption of human urine. Pranknet members can listen in real-time and discuss the progress together in a private [[chat room]].&lt;ref name="TSG1"&gt;{{Citation |title=Outing An Online Outlaw |newspaper=The Smoking Gun |date=August 4, 2009 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/telephone-terrorist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a wave of the pranks across the United States prompted internal alerts by [[Choice Hotels]], as well as advisories by the [[Orange County, Florida]] Sheriff's office, and others.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{Citation |last=Leyden |first=John |title=Hotel prank call badboy tracked down to mum's flat |newspaper=The Register |date=August 10, 2009 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/10/pranknet/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, law enforcement officials from a number of jurisdictions and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] began investigating the various incidents as well as the identity of "Dex".&lt;ref name="qsr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;

==Technology==
Pranknet participants initially used [[Skype]] to make their calls. {{As of|2009}}, Skype provided an uncontrolled registration system for users without proof of identity, making it difficult to trace and identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-biondi/bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf |format=PDF |title=Silver Needle in the Skype |author=Philippe BIONDI|author2=Fabrice DESCLAUX |publisher=blackhat |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Skype began an internal investigation, Pranknet left Skype and briefly used [[Paltalk]] for its chats. However, Paltalk banned Pranknet after a February 2009 [[KFC]] incident(see below). After Pranknet users were banned from Paltalk, the company was subjected to multiple [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS]] attacks.&lt;ref name="TSG1"/&gt; Beginning in 2009, members chatted before, during, and after each prank via Beyluxe Messenger, which is owned and operated outside [[North America]]. Audiences range from 40 to 200 people at any given time.

Pranks that created sufficient havoc were posted on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Citation |last=Leonard |first=Tom |title=FBI probes PrankNET over thousands of dollars in damage caused to hotels and restaurants |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=July 15, 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/5829770/FBI-probes-PrankNET-over-thousands-of-dollars-in-damage-caused-to-hotels-and-restaurants.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Updates were also provided through a [[Twitter]] account.&lt;ref name="Foxnews"&gt;{{Citation |last=Abrams |first=Joseph |title=Online Pranksters Wreak Havoc at Hotels, Restaurants Nationwide |publisher=Fox News |date=July 14, 2009 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,532241,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Pranknet incidents==
In February 2009, "Dex" called a KFC restaurant in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. Posing as a manager from the corporate office, he persuaded employees to douse the building with [[Automatic fire suppression|fire suppression chemicals]] and to then proceed outside, remove all of their clothing and urinate on each other. He claimed the chemicals were caustic and this would render them inert.&lt;ref name="Foxnews" /&gt; When "Dex" posted the audio to [[YouTube]] he described it as "Epic KFC Prank Call (greatest ever)...dex successfully convinces the 3 female employees to undress fully nude outside and urinate on each other." Many months later "Dex", posing this time as an [[insurance adjuster]] called the same KFC and had the victims describe their experiences while Pranknet members listened.&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

On February 10, "Dex" and a member called "DTA_Mike", posing as hotel front desk employees, called two separate guests at the [[Best Western]] in [[Shillington, Pennsylvania]]. Using the pretense of a ruptured gas line, the caller persuaded each guest to break a window and then throw the television out. "Dex" and his friend repeated the same stunt on February 19 with a Best Western in [[Santee, California]].&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

On April 30, a Pranknet member named "Rollin in the A" called Prejean's Restaurant in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] posing as an official from the health department. This target was selected because the restaurant provided [[Streaming media|live video streaming]] of its dining area on their own website. The victim at this restaurant was told that Prejean’s pork was tainted with the [[swine flu]]. "Rollin in the A" also told the manager to close the restaurant immediately and tell the customers (75 of them) that they may have eaten tainted food.&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

On May 27, "Dex" called a [[Hampton Inn]] in [[York, Nebraska]] and tricked an employee into setting off the [[fire alarm]]. As guests made their way to the lobby, a second call was placed to the front desk. "Dex" claimed that, to avoid alleged fines, the [[fire department]] should not be called. Instead, the caller gave various bogus instructions to turn the alarm off, including going to a website that only displayed [[pornography]]. The next suggestion from the caller was to break the front windows of the hotel. A truck driver staying at the hotel volunteered, and under direction from "Dex", the man drove his [[semi-trailer truck]] into the front door.&lt;ref name="YorkNewsTimes" /&gt; Later that night, "Dex" [[Twitter|tweeted]]: "I just pulled off the most epic prank. I had a hotel guest back his truck into the hotel front window (in the lobby), and break the window." The post was deleted in late July.&lt;ref name="Foxnews"/&gt;

On June 6, 2009, a prank was made on a [[Holiday Inn Express]] in [[Conway, Arkansas]]. The caller posed as a representative from the company that installed the hotel’s [[fire sprinkler]] and claimed the system needed to be reset by pulling the [[fire alarm]]. Once the alarm was turned on, the clerk was told that the sprinklers would activate unless windows were broken.&lt;ref name="katv"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dickerson |first=Rachel Parker |title=Web Site Unmasks Motel Prankster |publisher=KATV |date=August 7, 2009 |url=http://www.katv.com/news/stories/0809/647593.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810161047/http://www.katv.com/news/stories/0809/647593.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same day, the pranksters called a [[Comfort Suites]] in [[Gadsden, Alabama]], persuading a clerk to pull a fire alarm; sprinklers were subsequently activated, causing water damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/alabama-hotel-damaged-phone-prank?page=0|title=Alabama Hotel Damaged In Phone Prank|publisher=The Smoking Gun|date=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, a Pranknet member called a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] and, purporting there to be a [[gas leak]], convinced a family staying there to break windows with the lid for the toilet tank and throw their mattress out the window.&lt;ref name="orlando"&gt;{{Citation |last=Beitsch |first=Rebecca |last2=Edwards |first2=Amy L. |title=Pranksters strike: Indian River County deputy fooled into breaking hotel window with toilet tank |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=July 9, 2009 |url=http://archive.tcpalm.com/news/pranksters-strike-indian-river-county-deputy-fooled-into-breaking-hotel-window-with-toilet-tank-ep-3-347394191.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident cost $5,000 in damages.&lt;ref name="Foxnews"/&gt;

Also in July, a Pranknet caller informed two hotel guests that deadly spiders were about to infest their room. The caller was able to manipulate the couple into breaking their window with the tank lid from their toilet.&lt;ref name="Foxnews"/&gt;

On July 5, Pranknet members Powell and Markle called an [[Arby’s]] in Baytown (where Powell lives) and talked a worker there into triggering the fire suppression system, causing an estimated $4,600 in damages. Powell failed in his attempts to get any windows broken.&lt;ref name="TSG1"/&gt; Powell was later arrested and charged with criminal mischief for the incident.&lt;ref name="TGSxx" /&gt;

On July 20, Markle tricked a desk clerk at the [[Homewood Suites by Hilton|Homewood Suites]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] into drinking another person’s [[urine]]. The prank started with a call to a guest. The guest was told it was the front desk calling and that a prior guest had tested positive for [[Hepatitis C]]. The guest was then told there was a doctor on site and a simple [[urine test]] could determine if the guest was infected. The urine was to be brought to the front desk in a simple drinking glass. Switching roles, Markle then called the front desk alleging to be an employee of [[Martinelli's|Martinelli's Cider]]. He told the clerk that a representative from the company would like to come downstairs with a sample of their new drink. The guest from the previous call then arrived and handed the clerk his urine. Markle then coaxed the woman to try it. He asked how it tasted. "Horrible," she said. "That does not taste like cider. I'm not going to take another sip, that's horrible." Markle replied: "Well, I need to inform you of something, ma'am. I want you to understand that you just drank that man's urine."&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt; In its investigation, the Lufkin Police Department's cyber crimes division requested a [[subpoena]] for Markle's Skype  activities.&lt;ref name="Lufkin2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Cook |first=Ashley |title=Police expand investigation into Diboll man's activities |newspaper=Lufkin Daily News |date=August 7, 2009 |url=http://www.lufkindailynews.com/hp/content/news/stories/2009/08/07/Markle.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810084814/http://www.lufkindailynews.com/hp/content/news/stories/2009/08/07/Markle.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police report classifies the Lexington incident as first-degree wanton [[endangerment]], a Class D [[felony]] in Kentucky.&lt;ref name="LexingtonHeraldLeader"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ulber |first=Emily |title=Phone prank at south Lexington hotel might be linked to international ring |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=August 7, 2009 |url=http://www.kentucky.com/181/story/887545.html?storylink=omni_popular}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markle was subsequently sentenced to a [[shock incarceration]] term of six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/prankster-apologizes-for-urine-call-342517|title=Felonious Phone Terrorist Admits, Apologizes For Heinous Hotel Urine Prank|publisher=The Smoking Gun|date=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, an employee at a Holiday Inn Express was persuaded by a Pranknet caller to set off a fire alarm, break windows, and set off sprinklers which flooded the building. Damages were estimated at $50,000.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

''The Smoking Gun'' reported that Pranknet leader "Dex" was responsible for an October 21 hoax in which he phoned [[ESPN]] reporter [[Elizabeth Moreau]], tricking her into breaking windows in her room at the Hilton Garden Inn in [[Gainesville, Florida]].  He then initiated a conference call with a front desk employee at the hotel, where he then claimed he was Moreau's boyfriend and that the damage was a result of them fighting, as well as making a number of vulgar statements.&lt;ref name="tsgoct25"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/pranknet-boss-hoaxed-espn-reporter |title=Pranknet Boss Hoaxed ESPN Reporter &amp;#124; The Smoking Gun |last=staff |date=25 October 2010 |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the hoax, a Gainesville Police detective was assigned to the case.&lt;ref name="tsgoct25"/&gt;

In November 2010, an elderly man staying at a [[Motel 6]] in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] was tricked by a Pranknet member posing as a hotel administrator into destroying his television set and smashing mirrors in his room with a wrench to destroy hidden cameras supposedly left by a previous guest.&lt;ref name="elderlyman"/&gt;  The man, told that there was a "midget" trapped in an adjoining room, was then tricked into destroying a sheetrock wall behind his room door, almost making his way through to the next room.&lt;ref name="elderlyman"/&gt;  As one of the prankster's returned calls was heard by police and other guests who received prank calls soon called the front desk, the hotel did not hold the man accountable for the damages, but did ask him to leave.&lt;ref name="elderlyman"/&gt;  The pranksters called back on March 11, 2011, persuading a guest to "disable" a [[sprinkler head]] by smashing it with a toilet lid to prevent a 'toxic gas' from entering the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/south-carolina/stop-us-if-youve-heard-prank-caller-dials-motel-6-guest|title=Stop Us If You've Heard This Before: Prank Caller Dials A Motel 6 Guest...|publisher=The Smoking Gun|date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to TSG, "Motel 6 is a preferred target because Pranknet members can call directly into rooms without having to know a guest's name"&lt;ref name="elderlyman" /&gt; As of November 1, 2011, this is no longer possible. After police arrived to answer a 911 call placed by the motel manager, they declined to press charges against the victim but noted that other similar phone calls had been received at the motel.&lt;ref name="elderlyman" /&gt;

On December 5, 2010, two Pranknet members identified by ''The Smoking Gun'' collaborated to humiliate an Iraq War veteran, 22, at a Motel 6 in Amarillo, Texas.  One, posing as the hotel receptionist, informed him that the prior occupant of his room had been diagnosed with "[[H1N1]] flu virus", and transferred him to the other, posing as a physician, who over the course of half an hour directed him to induce vomiting, then to consume some of his own urine to "kill the incubation period", and finally to collect a [[stool sample]] in a pillowcase, which he was to bring to the front desk. A prankster then called the hotel's actual front desk, identifying himself by the guest's full name and claiming to be so angry with the service that he would leave a pillowcase full of feces at the front desk.  The receptionist locked the door and called police, so the veteran returned to his room, where his conversation with police officers the receptionist had summoned became audible to the pranksters' followers.  They finished by calling other visitors at the hotel describing aspects of the prank until the police were called again half an hour later.  With voice electronically altered and posing as the mother of a boy making prank calls, one of the pranksters managed to convince police to put the victim back on the phone, who unknowingly recounted his experience to the pranksters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/vile-phone-prank-pulled-iraq-vet|title=Vile Phone Prank Pulled On Iraq Vet|publisher=The Smoking Gun|date=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2011, a Holiday Inn in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] was targeted.  Taking advantage of the ability to call guests of the hotel directly, the prankster pretended to be a Fire Department employee reading instructions from a computer checklist to prevent an explosion from a gas leak.  These instructions included to "break the red glass vial in the sprinkler", leading to $115,000 in water damage in seven guest rooms and a conference room.  The guest was also persuaded to rip a mirror from his wall to find the (nonexistent) shutoff valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/hotel-prank-causes-115000-damages|title=Hotel Prank Causes $115,000 In Damages|publisher=The Smoking Gun|date=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phone and computer hijacking===
Beginning in July 2009, "Dex" began hijacking [[phone number]]s of U.S. businesses and had them forwarded to his Skype account. Claiming to be an authority from a particular business, he calls a phone company and claims they have no dial tone. He then requests that all calls be forwarded to the number he provides.&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

On July 7, "Dex" took over incoming calls of the Olympic Game Farm in [[Port Angeles, Washington]] making obscene sexual comments to customers who called. On July 11, he repeated the stunt with the Fun 4 All amusement park in [[Chula Vista, California]]. On July 13 he took over incoming calls to a Best Western in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] for over 12 hours. In one interaction, a woman called to find out if her husband had arrived and was told first that he had been in an accident, and then that he was having sex with a man in his room and did not wish to be disturbed. On July 15, "Dex" controlled incoming calls to a [[Hilton Garden Inn]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. He told people inquiring about a shuttle to take a cab and they’d be reimbursed. He told some callers the hotel had a swine flu outbreak and told other callers the hotel was in the midst of a [[Hostage crisis|hostage situation]].&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

Talking hotel front desk clerks through a series of steps using [[TeamViewer]], "Dex" has posed as a corporate headquarters [[Information technology|IT]] supervisor and taken remote control of hotel computers.&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

===Craigslist abuse===
Pranknet members frequently place [[Craigslist]] ads offering free tickets or items. Inquirers are bombarded with obscene sexual rants and racial epithets. A 12-year-old girl called about a free trampoline, and "Dex" told her not to get pregnant by a black man because "they have [[AIDS]]". Markle frequently calls women who are selling household items on the site. After getting the victim’s home address, he then tells her he is on his way over to rape her and kill her children.&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

==Smoking Gun investigation==
"Dex" and other Pranknet members had regularly taunted victims and others, saying they were untraceable.&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt; In an interview with [[The Smoking Gun]] on June 17, 2009, "Dex" exhibited no worries about being tracked down or caught. In a July co-interview with Markle, he boasted: "It's too difficult to find me. I'm a ghost on the Internet. I do pretty much everything I can to keep anything out of my computer that would lead it back to my actual computer. I'm not a stupid individual, like I said."&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt;

In June 2009, The Smoking Gun launched an investigation that lasted nearly two months and included travel to [[Windsor, Ontario]] and a [[stakeout]] outside Malik’s mother’s home. Smoking Gun editor [[William Bastone]] emailed "Dex", and during a Skype interview provided [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] on the Smoking Gun website. The URLs were unique; when Malik viewed them, it revealed his [[IP address]] and location.&lt;ref name="VancouverSun"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chen |first=Dalson |title=Ontario man leader of notorious U.S. pranksters, website claims |newspaper=The Vancouver Sun |date=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sguninvestigation&gt;{{cite web |title=Telephone Terrorist |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/telephone-terrorist |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names, biographies and locations of Pranknet’s founder "Dex" and a number of prolific members, and their other findings, were published on their website and provided to the FBI in August 2009.&lt;ref name="YorkNewsTimes"&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Melanie |title=Hotel prank unraveling, according to Court TV website |newspaper=''[[York News-Times]]'' |date=August 5, 2009 |url=http://www.yorknewstimes.com/articles/2009/08/05/news/doc4a78fc825bdfc823867445.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809102433/http://www.yorknewstimes.com/articles/2009/08/05/news/doc4a78fc825bdfc823867445.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
According to crime reporting website The Smoking Gun, key members included:
* Tariq Malik, also known as Pranknet leader "Dex" (a tribute to the character [[Dexter Morgan]], a fictional [[serial killer]]).&lt;ref name="TSG1"/&gt; In an interview with ''The Globe and Mail'', "Dex" denied he was Malik (but confirmed he is Canadian).&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{Citation |last=Verma |first=Sonya |title=Out-of-line pranksters take cover online |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=August 8, 2009 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/out-of-line-pranksters-takecoveronline/article4213669/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* William Marquis, Pranknet’s "second in command".&lt;ref name="TSG1"/&gt; Known as Hempster, Marquis was previously convicted in 2004 for [[drunk driving]] and in 2005 for [[marijuana]] production.&lt;ref name="TSG1"/&gt; [[CBC News]] attempted to interview Marquis regarding the Pranknet allegations. However, he did not answer his door.&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt;
* James Markle, one of the group's most prolific callers. Markle was already a [[person of interest]] in a Lufkin Police investigation involving a phone call to a local [[McDonald's]],&lt;ref name="Lufkin1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Cook |first=Ashley |title=Diboll man alleged to be prankster says it's not him |newspaper=Lufkin Daily News |date=August 6, 2009 |url=http://www.lufkindailynews.com/hp/content/news/stories/2009/08/06/prankster.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810074955/http://www.lufkindailynews.com/hp/content/news/stories/2009/08/06/prankster.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was arrested for this subsequently.&lt;ref name="markle001"&gt;{{Citation |title=Prank phone call caused $5,000 to McDonald's |publisher=KTRE (Lufkin) |date=September 9, 2009 |url=http://www.ktre.com/global/story.asp?s=11099439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smoking Gun had based the claim upon information from old MySpace and Facebook pages, and people from the area who identified Markle in photos.&lt;ref name="KTRE"&gt;{{Citation |last=Phillips |first=Christel |title=National Web site fingers Diboll teen as prankster |publisher=KTRE |date=August 7, 2009 |url=http://www.ktre.com/Global/story.asp?S=10862439&amp;nav=menu118_11_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smoking Gun also published official documents showing that Markle pleaded guilty to aggravated [[sexual assault]] of a child in 2005, serving two years in a juvenile detention facility for having sex with a 5-year-old girl and then threatening to kill her if she told anyone about the incident.&lt;ref name="TSG12"&gt;{{Citation |title=Another Pranknet Child Molester |newspaper=The Smoking Gun |date=August 6, 2009 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/another-pranknet-child-molester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Lufkin Daily News'', Markle denied that the person described on TSG was him, claiming instead it was another person called the Samoan Prankster.&lt;ref name="Lufkin1" /&gt; He was charged with felonies in two separate states: for making a felony terroristic threat in the Lufkin McDonald's case and for terrorizing and criminal damage (both felonies) in a separate incident involving a Wendy's restaurant in [[Gretna, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="smokingG"&gt;{{Citation |title=Second Pranknet Member Arrested |newspaper=The Smoking Gun |date=September 9, 2009 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/second-pranknet-member-arrested}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later extradited to Louisiana as a result of the charges filed in the Gretna incident.&lt;ref name="marklexxx"&gt;{{Citation |last=Phillips |first=Christel |title="Prankster" Extradited |newspaper=KTRE (Lufkin) |date=September 24, 2009 |url=http://www.ktre.com/Global/story.asp?S=11195311}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, Markle was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment in Texas for the prank call to the Lufkin McDonald's.&lt;ref name="TSG1202"&gt;{{Citation |title=Degenerate Phone Prankster Receives Severe Dose Of Texas Justice |newspaper=The Smoking Gun |date=December 2, 2010 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/prank/degenerate-phone-prankster-receives-severe-dose-texas-justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shawn Powell, previously imprisoned for [[Child sexual abuse|indecency with a minor]] (for taking nude photos of an 8-year-old female relative), a felony that put him in custody for 13 months. He specialized in racist and threatening calls.&lt;ref name="TSG1"/&gt; He was charged with [[criminal mischief]] for his part in a hoax call to the Baytown Arby's restaurant, resulting in the fire suppression system being activated and resulting in $1,350 worth of damage.&lt;ref name="TGSxx"&gt;{{Citation |title=First Pranknet Arrest |newspaper=The Smoking Gun |date=August 26, 2009 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0826091slipknot1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former member, Jericho Batsford, left the group in 2009 after the [[Conway, Arkansas]] incident, and contacted local FBI agents.&lt;ref name="logcab" /&gt; She told them she knew Dex's identity to be that of Malik&lt;ref name="logcab" /&gt; and that he was responsible for many incidents.&lt;ref name="Foxnews" /&gt; In response to her defection, Pranknet members have constantly harassed her home and her workplace via Skype and Beyluxe. Malik told members to be patient, that she would not answer the phone and let them get to her, and to instead "get her later on down the road, when she least expects it."&lt;ref name="TSG1" /&gt; Batsford had participated in some phone pranks, but left when she witnessed members encouraging children under the age of 18 to make bomb threats.&lt;ref name="logcab" /&gt;

Officials in at least four U.S. States and six U.S. cities stated that they were considering charges against "Dex" and his possible [[extradition]] from [[Canada]] to face trial.&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6940">A '''proxy firm''' (also a proxy advisor, proxy adviser, proxy voting agency, vote service provider or shareholder voting research provider) provides services to shareholders (in most cases an [[institutional investor]] of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, quoted companies.

The typical services provided include agenda translation, provision of vote management software, voting policy development, company research, and vote administration including vote execution. According to their websites, not all firms provide voting recommendations and those that do may simply execute client voting instructions.

The votes executed are called "Proxy Votes" because the shareholder usually does not attend the meeting and instead sends instructions - a proxy appointment - for a third party, usually the chairman of the meeting to vote shares in accordance with the instructions given on the voting card.

According to their websites, most industry participants offer global coverage.

== Controversial role==
The role of proxy firms has come under considerable scrutiny in recent years, most notably from the US corporate lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/controversy-ignites-competition-among-proxy/story.aspx?guid=BD711286-71DE-4D3B-939F-9C6B9F1BC100|title=Controversy ignites competition among proxy firms|author=Alistair Barr &amp; Jonathan Burton|publisher=Marketwatch|date=2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dent|first=George W.|date=2014-01-01|title=A Defense of Proxy Advisors|ssrn=2451240|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the US Securities and Exchange Commission fined ISS $300,000 for revealing non-public information in respect of clients proxy votes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171574952|title=SEC.gov {{!}} SEC Charges Institutional Shareholder Services in Breach of Clients' Confidential Proxy Voting Information|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts of interest ==
A potential conflict of interest identified by the [[Government Accountability Office]] is that some owners of proxy firms do business with both issuers and investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerdonassociates.com/News-Detail.asp?cid=&amp;navID=&amp;NewsID=198|title=The influence of proxy advisory firms on executive remuneration|date=2007-01-10|publisher=Guerdon Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of executive remuneration, or executive pay, is a notable feature of the work of shareholder voting research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/01/15/proxy-firm-questions-tyson-chiefs-pay/|title=Proxy firm questions Tyson chief's pay|author=Zac Bissonnette|date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some policymakers believe that increasing competition in the industry may improve service quality. For example, in 2010 a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission consultation document asked whether certain issues in the proxy advisory industry, including conflicts of interest, are affected by limited competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2010/34-62495.pdf|title=Proxy Plumbing Concept Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9372">{{About|government action. [[Policy]], both public and private, is a broader concept. The article on [[public policy doctrine]] discusses the use of the phrase 'public policy' in legal doctrine}}
{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}

'''Public policy''' is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative [[Executive (government)|executive branches]] of the [[State (polity)|state]] with regard to a class of issues, in a manner consistent with [[law]] and [[Institution|institutional customs]]. 

==Overview==
The foundation of public policy is composed of national constitutional laws and regulations. Further substrates include both [[judicial]] interpretations and [[regulations]] which are generally authorized by legislation. Public policy is considered strong when it solves problems efficiently and effectively, serves and supports governmental institutions and policies, and encourages active citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Characteristics of Successful Public Policy|url=http://publicadmin.norwich.edu/characteristics-of-successful-public-policy/|website=Norwich University Public Administration|publisher=Norwich University Public Administration|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars define public policy as a system of "courses of action, [[regulation|regulatory]] measures, [[law]]s, and [[funding]] priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/policy/definition.shtml Kilpatrick, Dean, "Definitions of Public Policy and Law"]&lt;/ref&gt; Public policy is commonly embodied in "constitutions, legislative acts, and judicial decisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1368469 Schuster II, W. Michael, "For the Greater Good: The Use of Public Policy Considerations in Confirming Chapter 11 Plans of Reorganization"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], this concept refers not only to the result of policies, but more broadly to the [[decision-making]] and [[analysis]] of governmental decisions. As an [[academic discipline]], public policy is studied by professors and students at [[public policy schools]] of major [[universities]] throughout the country.  The U.S. professional association of public policy practitioners, researchers, scholars, and students is the [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]].

==Government actions and process==
Public policy making can be characterized as a dynamic, complex, and interactive system through which public problems are identified and countered by creating new public policy or by reforming existing public policy.&lt;ref name="Analysing Public Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Peter|title=Analysing Public Policy|year=1998|publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public problems can originate in endless ways and require different policy responses (such as regulations, subsidies, Import quota|quotas, and laws) on the local, national, or international level.&lt;ref name="Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharkansky|first=Ira|author2=R. Hofferbert |title=Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy|journal=The American Political Science Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public policy making is a continuous process that has many feedback loops. Verification and program evaluation are essential to the functioning of this system.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thei|first=Geurts|author2=Be Informed |title=Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public problems that influence public policy making can be of economic, social, or political nature.&lt;ref name="Public Policy Process"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Public Policy Process|year=2005|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each system is influenced by different public problems and issues, and has different stakeholders; as such, each requires different public policy.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

In public policy making, numerous individuals, corporations, non-profit organizations and interest groups compete and collaborate to influence policymakers to act in a particular way.&lt;ref name="Kilpatrick"&gt;Kilpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

The large set of actors in the public policy process, such as politicians, civil servants, lobbyists, domain experts, and industry or sector representatives, use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims, including advocating their positions publicly, attempting to educate supporters and opponents, and mobilizing allies on a particular issue.&lt;ref name="Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy"/&gt; 

Many actors can be important in the public policy process, but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand. In doing so, government officials are expected to meet public sector ethics and take the needs of all project stakeholder|stakeholders into account.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

Since societies have changed in the past decades, the public policy making system changed too. In the 2010s, public policy making is increasingly goal-oriented, aiming for measurable results and goals, and decision-centric, focusing on decisions that must be taken immediately.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt; 

Furthermore, mass communications and technological changes such as the widespread availability of the Internet have caused the public policy system to become more complex and interconnected.&lt;ref name="The Process and Effects of mass communication"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schramm|first=Wilbur|title=The Process and Effects of mass communication|date=165|isbn=0252001974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes pose new challenges to the current public policy systems and pressures leaders to evolve to remain effective and efficient.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

==Academic discipline==
{{Main|Policy Studies}}

As an academic discipline, public policy brings in elements of many [[social science]] fields and concepts, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[political economy]], [[social policy]], [[program evaluation]], [[policy analysis]], and [[public management]], all as applied to problems of governmental administration, management, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pellissery|first=Sony|title= Public Policy |journal=The SAGE Encyclopedia of World Poverty|year=2015|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics, in its focus on the application of theory to practice.  While the majority of [[public policy degrees]] are [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees, there are several universities that offer undergraduate education in public policy.

Traditionally, the academic field of public policy focused on [[domestic policy]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]] that occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries created a need for a subset of public policy that focused on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gppi.net/fileadmin/gppi/Global_Public_Policy_Foreign_Affairs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many traditional public policy schools had to adjust their curricula to better suit this new policy landscape, as well as develop entirely new curricula altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. "Global public policy, transnational policy communities, and their networks." Policy studies journal 36, no. 1 (2008): 19-38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5524">'''Research and Development Capital Allowances''', also known as RDAs, are a tax relief for businesses in the United Kingdom.  They provide a 100 per cent first year [[capital allowance]] for [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) capital expenditure. RDAs are the capital expenditure equivalent to the R&amp;D tax relief scheme.

==History==
RDAs were the new name given to Scientific Research Allowances (which already existed) when the [[R&amp;D]] Tax Credit scheme was launched in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/camanual/ca60100.htm " ca60100"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
R&amp;D Tax Relief only applies to revenue expenditure - generally, costs incurred on day-to-day operations, as opposed to expenditure on capital assets.
However, RDAs allow relief for R&amp;D capital expenditure as a capital allowance. RDAs make it possible to claim 100 per cent of the capital cost against taxable profits in the year the cost is incurred. This can deliver a helpful cash flow boost and a shortened payback period.
A company should consider applying for RDAs if it has:
*constructed or purchased a laboratory, test bed, or pilot plant
*capitalised large amounts of R&amp;D expenditure

If any R&amp;D revenue expenditure is capitalised in a company's accounts, it may still qualify for R&amp;D Tax Relief or it may only qualify under RDAs. The accounts treatment when the asset is recognised on the balance sheet, as opposed to being written-off immediately in the profit and loss account, is not conclusive of whether the expenditure is revenue or capital for tax purposes.
The distinction between revenue and capital expenditure in the context of its R&amp;D tax treatment is critical. HMRC give details on how to distinguish between the two categories on their website&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim35000.htm "revenue V capital expenditure"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in their CIRD manual.&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD81700.htm "CIRD81700"]&lt;/ref&gt; Further detail can also be found in section 1308 of [[Corporation Tax Act 2009]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporation Tax Act 2009|Corporation Tax Act]],[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/4/contents "Section 1308"]&lt;/ref&gt; (which in turn updated section 53 of [[Finance Act]] 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[[Finance Act]],[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/12/contents "Section 53"]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to the revenue treatment of capitalised costs which relate to intangible assets.

==How it works==
RDAs are available for expenditure of a capital nature on R&amp;D related to a company’s trade, e.g.:
*laboratories,
*other research facilities,
*research equipment,
*company cars used by people undertaking the R&amp;D, and
*a new IT system for internal use in the R&amp;D facility etc. etc.

So, unlike for R&amp;D Tax Relief where only certain categories of expenditure can be claimed, RDAs are available on most expenditure incurred for the carrying out of, or provision of facilities for, R&amp;D (except land and the cost of acquiring intellectual property). This includes building or premises assets which would not otherwise qualify for alternative forms of capital allowances (such as the Annual Investment Allowance).

This means that where a company acquires or builds property with the intention of using the property for the purposes of carrying on qualifying research and development, then most, if not all, of the expenditure involved will qualify for a 100 per cent capital allowance in the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred.

==Other technology tax reliefs==
*[[Research and Development Tax Credit|Research &amp; Development Tax Credit]]
*[[Research and Development Expenditure Credit|Research &amp; Development Expenditure Credit]]
*[[Patent Box]]
*[[Creative Sector Tax Relief]]s including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-End TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief
The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

==See also==
There are various sources of information about RDAs.
*The original source legislation (contained in the 2001 Capital Allowances Act Part 6)&lt;ref&gt;Capital allowances Act,[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2001/2/contents "Part 6"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*HMRC’s published guidance in their Capital Allowances manual for RDAs ;&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/camanual/ca60000.htm "Capital allowances manual"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*HMRC’s published guidance in their Corporate Intangibles and R&amp;D manual (CIRD) re the treatment of revenue versus capital expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD81700.htm "revenue V capital expenditure"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government working group==
There is no formal government working group for RDAs. There is however a formal working group for R&amp;D Tax Relief to assist and develop government thinking on R&amp;D tax initiatives. Members of this Working Group include representatives from: [[HMRC]] and [[HM Treasury]]; industry; the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]; [[KPMG]]; [[Ernst and Young]]) and independent consultants (MMP Tax); and representatives from professional bodies.

== History ==

The first National Symposium on Corporate Responsibility: Compliance &amp; Ethics Programs was held on November 21-22, 2002, sponsored by the [[Health Care Compliance Association]] (HCCA) in association with [[Microsoft]] Corporation in [[Redmond, Washington]]. The conference drew 100 attendees from some of the top corporations in the nation including [[DuPont]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Boeing]], [[Starbucks]], the [[University of Texas]] and many more. The keynote speaker was [[William C. Powers]] Jr. who served as Chairman of the Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of [[Enron]] Corporation.

Requests for a second Symposium were answered in 2003. More than 250 attendees filled the room to hear speakers such as James Sheehan, Associate United States Attorney for Civil Programs; Ron James, CEO, Center for Ethical Business Cultures; Honorable Michael E. Horowitz, Commissioner, United States Sentencing Commission; and Colleen Rowley, Special Agent, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. Their mission was clear, there needed to be a forum for business professionals working in the compliance and ethics field.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regulatory compliance|Regulatory Compliance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compliance and Ethics Institute [http://www.complianceethicsinstitute.org] now attracts approximately 1500 attendees annually and the SCCE has grown to over 5,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecompliance.org/AboutSCCE/History.aspx SCCE History]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education, publications and events ==

The SCCE offers publications and live training&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/society-of-corporate-compliance-and-ethics-announces-upper-midwest-regional-compliance-and-ethics-conference-october-9-2009-embassy-suites-minneapolis-airport-bloomington-mn-62363637.html "Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics Announces Upper Midwest Regional Compliance and Ethics Conference, October 9, 2009, Embassy Suites Minneapolis Airport, Bloomington, MN"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecompliance.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Events1&amp;Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=8&amp;ContentID=1429 SCCE Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027223804/http://www.corporatecompliance.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Events1&amp;Template=%2FTaggedPage%2FTaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=8&amp;ContentID=1429 |date=2009-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to its members.

== Certification ==

The SCCE worked with the Compliance Certification Board (CCB) to develop an examination certification in compliance and ethics. To date over 1200 people have obtained the Certified Compliance and Ethics Professional Certification (CCEP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compliancecertification.org/CCEP/CertifiedComplianceEthicsProfessional.aspx SCCE CCEP Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; The CCEP Fellow and CCEP International certifications has also been added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compliancecertification.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Code of Professional Ethics ==

On August 29, 2007, The Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE) adopted a Code of Professional Ethics for Compliance and Ethics Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecompliance.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/ProfessionalCode/SCCECodeOfEthics_English.pdf SCCE Code of Professional Ethics for Compliance and Ethics Professionals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807061118/http://www.corporatecompliance.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/ProfessionalCode/SCCECodeOfEthics_English.pdf |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code’s purpose is to provide guidance and rules to all Compliance and Ethics Professionals (CEP) in the performance of their professional responsibilities.
In creating the Code of Professional Ethics, the SCCE establishes both overarching principles to guide compliance officials and rules of conduct, which represent specific standards that prescribe the minimum level of professional conduct expected of CEPs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10847">'''Technopolis GS''' is a project to create a modern electronics industrial park in the [[Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaliningrad region]] of [[Russia]].

==Project background==

In 2007, in [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gusev]], for the first time in Russia, was established a production of set-top boxes for receiving satellite and terrestrial television broadcasts. Several months later, the [[General Satellite| General Satellite Corporation]] started building a plant in Gusev to manufacture household electronics products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehnopolis.gs/concept/|title=Технополис GS. Цель и задачи проекта...|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between the mayor of Gusev, [[Nikolay Tsukanov]], and the president of the [[General Satellite| General Satellite Corporation]], Andrey Tkachenko, was signed in 2008, in order to create a modern [[Science park|industrial park]] in the city. The idea was approved by local authorities and was presented at the International Investment Forum "[[Sochi]]-2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehnopolis-gusev.ru/news/45/|title="Технополис GS" представлен на международном инвестиционном форуме "Сочи-2008″|accessdate=2010-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150944/http://www.tehnopolis-gusev.ru/news/45/|archivedate=2012-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to locate the new production facilities in Gusev, according to Andrey Tkachenko, was made for two reasons. 
First, the experience of the first similar plant that had been working in Gusev as part of the [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zone]] - the official residence of the Corporation - was successful. Second, the administration of the city took a great interest in cooperation for the creation of Technopolis and in a comprehensive solution to the problem of the territory development.&lt;ref name="spbref"&gt;{{cite web|author=Алексей Писарев.|date=5 June 2008|url=http://www.spbit.ru/news/n49693|publisher=SPBIT|title=Технополис от "Дженерал Сателайт"|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two plants, JSC NPO Digital Television Systems (DTS) and Prankor, Ltd., were run - their products have no analogues in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=31 August 2009|url=http://www.spbit.su/news/n64146/|publisher=ITSZ.ru|title="Корпорация Дженерал Сателайт" строит российский Тайвань|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants produce set-top boxes for receiving the satellite and terrestrial TV broadcasts, and the production conveyor ensures a complete production cycle: starting with the motherboard and all the way up to the case and the satellite antennas as well.  Formerly, most of these devices in the Russian market were imported, usually from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=14 March 2009|url=http://pdf.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml?2009/04/14/344244|publisher=CNews|title=Это возможно: выпуск электроники в РФ дешевле, чем в Китае|accessdate=2010-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824043856/http://pdf.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml?2009%2F04%2F14%2F344244|archivedate=24 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Project==
The market observers, in general, welcomed the General Satellite initiative and the investment prospects. "Industrial parks development, on one hand, is very expensive, and on the other – it is extremely knowledge-intensive”, - Pavel Zhavoronkov, an analyst at the investment firm Sovlink, said, while making a comment on the General Satellite Corporation plans. - “Based on the payroll size, 1500 to 2400 million rubles will be spent till the year 2011. The average payroll should be 1.95 billion, which will "swallow" almost 40% of the capital raised. The establishment of such an Industrial Park is possible only if stringent standards and practices are observed in the construction and cash flow. From the perspective of the country, it is an invaluable contribution to the development and science."&lt;ref name="spbref" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While implementing such projects, developers are often faced with many difficulties, of which the most serious are legislation "gaps" and official circumlocution6. In this case, the local officials led by [[Georgi Boos]] – the Kaliningrad region Governor – proved to be a considerable support for the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Василий Одарущенко.|date=6 September 2010|url=http://www.zdt-gusev.ru/e/758196-shtefan-shtayn-pokidayu-gusev-v-pripodnyatom-n|title=Штефан Штайн: "Покидаю Гусев в приподнятом настроении"|publisher=ZDT-gusev|accessdate=2010-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226191706/http://www.zdt-gusev.ru/e/758196-shtefan-shtayn-pokidayu-gusev-v-pripodnyatom-n|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thanasis Giannakopoulos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Θανάσης Γιαννακόπουλος, born 1931) is a Greek [[businessman]], and a former pro [[sports club]] owner. His family has an estimated net worth of a €1 billion business empire.

==Vianex==
Giannakopoulos and his brother, [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|Pavlos]], are the owners of the [[pharmaceutical]] corporation [[Vianex]], which was founded in 1924, by their father, Dimitrios Giannakopoulos, as a small local import and distribution firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vianex.gr/Default.aspx?ID=40 Vianex.gr History A Success Story.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vianex currently manufactures and markets, in Greece and elsewhere, a variety of products, in collaboration with leading international firms. The company reported net sales of [[Euro|€]]240.2 million [[euros]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vianex.gr/Default.aspx?ID=41 Facts Meeting the Objectives.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Pavlos' personal fortune was estimated to be [[Euro|€]]400 million euros, one half of the Giannakopoulos brothers' [[Euro|€]]800 million euros  business empire.

==Panathinaikos Athens==
From 1987 to 2012, the Giannakopoulos brothers managed [[Panathinaikos B.C.]], [[Panathinaikos V.C.]], and all of the [[Panathinaikos]] club's amateur sports sections, from the [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] department to the [[water polo]] department. Thanasis was also the Chairman of the volleyball and amateur sections. Their involvement with the club brought Panathinaikos' basketball team their greatest successes, in both domestic and European competitions.

Thanasis was also President of the basketball club, from 2002 to 2012. Through 2012, Panathinaikos had won 13 out of the last 15 [[Greek Basket League]] championships (excluding the 2001–02, and 2011–12 seasons) and the [[EuroLeague]] championship in the years 1996, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos basketball in Wikipedia.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The club, during that time, also featured some of the best basketball players from Greece, along with star players from abroad, such as [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]], [[Dominique Wilkins]] and [[Dejan Bodiroga]].

The basketball section of the club alone had a reported budget of [[Euro|€]]35 million in 2009. In 2011, Thanasis and his brother [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|Pavlos]], won the [[EuroLeague Club Executive of the Year Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/86348/180/executives-of-the-year-pavlos-and-thanassis-giannakopoulos-panathinaikos Euroleague.net Executives of the Year: Pavlos and Thanassis Giannakopoulos, Panathinaikos.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Thanasis' nephew, [[Dimitrios Giannakopoulos]], the son of his brother, [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos|Pavlos]], took over control of [[Panathinaikos B.C.]].

==Other==
Nicknamed as ''typhoon'' (tyfonas) for his emotional character, Thanasis is also famous for his multi-coloured [[necktie]]s, with many flowers on them.

'''''The Founder''''' is a 2016 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[film]] directed by [[John Lee Hancock]] and written by [[Robert D. Siegel|Robert Siegel]]. The film stars [[Michael Keaton]] as businessman [[Ray Kroc]], and portrays the story of his creation of the [[McDonald's]] fast food chain. [[Nick Offerman]] and [[John Carroll Lynch]] co-star as McDonald's founders [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]].

The film premiered at [[Arclight Hollywood]] on December 7, 2016 and was released in the United States on January 20, 2017, by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It grossed only $24 million worldwide against a budget of $25 million, but received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for Keaton's performance.

== Plot ==
In 1954, [[Ray Kroc]] is an unsuccessful traveling salesman selling Prince Castle brand milkshake mixers. While he has a supportive wife, Ethel, and has saved enough to live a simple and comfortable life in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]], [[Illinois]], he craves more. Ray also observes that many of the drive-in restaurants that he tries to sell to are inefficiently run, with a long waiting time for orders and [[carhop]]s more concerned with avoiding the groping from [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] than getting the orders right. After learning that a drive-in in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to [[California]] to see it. What he finds is [[McDonald's]]—a highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging, and a family-friendly atmosphere.

Ray meets with the two McDonald brothers, [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|Maurice "Mac" and Richard "Dick" McDonald]]. Mac gives Ray a tour of the kitchens and he notes the employees' strong work ethic. Dick explains the high-quality food and lightning-fast service are the backbones of their restaurant. Ray takes the brothers to dinner and is told the origin story of McDonald's. The next day, Ray suggests that the brothers [[franchising|franchise]] the restaurant, but they hesitate; pointing out that they already tried, only to have encountered absentee franchisees who were lackadaisical in upholding their system. Ray persists and eventually convinces the brothers to allow him to lead their franchising efforts on the condition that he agree to a contract which requires all changes to receive the McDonald brothers' approval in writing.

Initially, Ray begins building a McDonald's restaurant in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]] while attempting to entice wealthy investors (specifically fellow members at his country club) to open franchises, but encounters the same poor management ethic which doomed the original franchise efforts. After encountering a dedicated Bible salesman who is Jewish, Ray hits on the idea of franchising to middle-class investors, who have more incentive to be hands-on and are willing to follow the McDonald's formula. This proves successful, and new franchises begin opening across the Midwest, with Ray representing himself as the creator of McDonald's. During this time, Ray meets Rollie Smith, an upscale restaurant owner in [[Minnesota]] who wishes to invest, and his wife [[Joan Kroc|Joan]], to whom Ray is immediately attracted.

Despite his success, Ray begins to encounter financial difficulties as his share of franchise profits is limited due to his contract, a share that the McDonald brothers decline to renegotiate. The brothers also refuse to allow the use of sponsorships for fear of ruining the image of their restaurants. Meanwhile, the owners are encountering higher than expected costs, particularly for refrigeration of large quantities of ice cream for milkshakes. Joan suggests a powdered milkshake to Ray as a way to avoid these costs, but the brothers consider it degrading to their food quality. Ray is also called to the bank as his [[mortgage]] is past due, but this is overheard by [[Harry J. Sonneborn|Harry Sonneborn]], a financial consultant for [[Tastee-Freez]], who requests to review Ray's books. Sonneborn realizes that the real profit opportunity is in providing real estate to the franchisees, which will not only provide a revenue stream, but give Ray leverage over his franchisees and the brothers. Ray incorporates a new company, Franchise Realty Corporation, and attracts new investors. This move upsets the brothers and emboldens Ray: he increasingly defies them by circumventing their authority and providing powdered milkshakes to all franchisees. Ray also divorces Ethel, who gets all his assets except any shares in his business.

Ray renames his company to the McDonald's Corporation and demands to be released from his contract and buy the McDonald brothers out, the news of which sends Mac into diabetic shock. Ray visits him in the hospital and offers a blank check to settle their business. The brothers agree to a $2.7 million lump sum payment, ownership of their original restaurant in San Bernardino, and a 1% annual royalty, but when the time comes to finalize the agreement, Ray refuses to include the royalty in the settlement and instead offers it as a [[handshake deal]]. Afterwards, in the men's room, Dick asks Ray why he had to take over their business, when he could have easily stolen their idea and recreated it. Ray argues that the true value of McDonald's is the name itself, which expresses all the attributes of [[Americana]] (as opposed to his [[Czech people|Czech]] Slavic-sounding name of Kroc).

The McDonald brothers are forced to take their own name off the original restaurant and Ray opens a new McDonald's franchise directly across the street, finally putting the brothers out of business. The film closes in 1970 with Ray preparing a speech where he praises himself for his success in his elaborate mansion with his new wife, Joan. An epilogue reveals that the McDonald brothers were never paid their royalties, which could have been in the area of $100 million a year.

The McDonald brothers original octagonal San Bernardino restaurant was built in Newnan in the parking lot of the [[Coweta County, Georgia|Coweta County]] Administration building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Founder' movie to open Friday|url=http://times-herald.com/news/2017/01/the-founder-movie-to-open-friday|work=The Newnan Times-Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a month of searching for suitable location, an old-style McDonald's building set with the "[[Golden Arches|golden arches]]" was constructed in a church parking lot in seven working days in [[Douglasville, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corley|first1=Laura|title=Golden Arches Are Going Up|url=http://www.douglascountysentinel.com/leisure/article_1662eb94-05a2-11e5-84bf-37dd1e7a0c7f.html|accessdate=June 6, 2015|work=Douglas County Sentinel|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set included a working kitchen with period-accurate kitchen equipment that was brought up to current code. Rearrangement of exterior features such as parking lot striping allowed that set to serve as each franchise location portrayed in the film. Both interior and exterior portions of the restaurant were modular, allowing countertops or entire wall sized glass panes to be removed to make room for cameras and other equipment.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Writer|first1=Laura Corley / Staff|title=Golden arches are going up|url=http://www.douglascountysentinel.com/leisure/article_1662eb94-05a2-11e5-84bf-37dd1e7a0c7f.html|work=Douglas County Sentinel|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, [[FilmNation Entertainment]], one of the film's production companies, sued The Weinstein Company for $15 million. The Weinstein Company released ''[[Gold (2016 film)|Gold]]'' on January 27, 2017, a week after ''The Founder'', which FilmNation claimed was a breach of contract, saying the two companies had an agreement that no Weinstein Company film would be released within a week before or after ''The Founder''.&lt;ref name=lawsuit/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawsuit2/&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''The Founder'' grossed $12.8 million in the United States and Canada and $11.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $24 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

In North America, the film was expected to gross $3 million from 1,115 theaters in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/01/split-xxx-return-of-xander-cage-the-founder-box-office-preview-1201888052/ |title='Split' And 'xXx' Merge Into Market While 'The Founder' May Get Lost In Heavy Traffic – Box Office Preview |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended up earning $3.8 million, finishing 9th at the box office.&lt;ref name="opening"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uni/Blumhouse's 'Split' Is A Hit With High $39M To $40M+; 'Xander Cage' Falls Down|url=http://deadline.com/2017/01/split-xxx-return-of-xander-cage-the-founder-late-night-thursday-previews-box-office-1201889940/|date=January 23, 2017|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its second week, the film made $2.6 million, a drop of 23.4%.&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/01/dogs-purpose-split-resident-evil-gold-box-office-1201895463/ |title=Is Controversy Impacting 'A Dog's Purpose' At The Box Office? |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 203 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Founder'' puts Michael Keaton's magnetic performance at the center of a smart, satisfying biopic that traces the rise of one of America's most influential businessmen – and the birth of one of its most far-reaching industries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_founder/|title=The Founder (2017)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score 66 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-founder |title=The Founder reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[Peter Travers]] gave the film three out of four stars, stating that director Hancock and screenwriter Siegel "strive hard – and mostly succeed – at keeping Hollywood sentiment out of the storytelling.... Set more than a half century ago, ''The Founder'' proves to be a movie for a divisive here and now. Step right up. You might just learn something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Travers|first1=Peter|title='The Founder' Review: Michael Keaton Makes a Happy Meal of McDonalds Biopic|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-the-founder-movie-review-w455928|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=19 January 2017|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RogerEbert.com]]'s [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite the film overly relying on exposition and failing to skillfully incorporate Ray Kroc's personal life into the narrative, "I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about ''The Founder'' constantly since seeing it... It's an ad that becomes a warning before circling around and becoming another, darker kind of advertisement, and one of the most intriguing and surprising things about ''The Founder'' is that, in the end, it seems vaguely ashamed of itself for letting this happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller|title=The Founder Movie Review &amp; Film Summary|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-founder-2017|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=19 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''Web-Based Enterprise Management''' ('''WBEM''') comprises a set of [[systems management | systems-management]] technologies developed  to unify the management of [[distributed computing]] environments. The WBEM initiative, initially sponsored in 1996 by BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Intel, and Microsoft, is now widely adopted.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Greg|title=What is WBEM?|url=http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/what-wbem|website=Windows IT Pro|accessdate=13 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113060813/http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/what-wbem|archivedate=13 November 2015|date=June 30, 1998|deadurl=no|quote=In 1996, BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Intel, and Microsoft sponsored the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) initiative, an effort to provide a unifying mechanism for describing and sharing management information.}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBEM is based on [[Internet standard]]s and [[Distributed Management Task Force]] (DMTF) [[open standard]]s: 

* [[Common Information Model (computing)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) infrastructure and schema
** CIM-[[XML]]
** CIM operations over [[HTTP]]
* [[WS-Management]] for [[web services]]

Although the name labels WBEM as "web-based", it is not necessarily dependent on any particular [[user interface]] (see below). Other systems-management approaches include [[remote shell]]s, proprietary solutions and [[IETF]] standardized [[network management | network-management]] architectures like the [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] and [[netconf]].

==Features==

WBEM allows the management of any element in a standard and inter-operable manner. 

WBEM provides the technology underlying different management initiatives in [[information technology]]:

* desktop management ([[Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware|DASH]])
* [[network management]] ([[Network management|NetMan]])
* storage management ([[Storage Management Initiative – Specification |SMI]])
* systems management ([[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware|SMASH]])
* virtualization management ([[Virtualization Management Initiative |VMAN]])

==Architecture==

To understand the WBEM architecture, consider the components which lie between the operator trying to manage a device (configure it, turn it off and on, collect alarms, etc.) and the actual hardware and software of the device:

# the operator will invoke some form of [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), [[Browser User Interface]] (BUI), or [[command-line interface]] (CLI). The WBEM standard has nothing to say about this interface (although the definition of a CLI for specific applications has started): WBEM operates independently of the human interface, since human interfaces can change without the rest of the system needing to note such changes.
# the GUI, BUI or CLI will interface with a WBEM client through a small set of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs). This client will find the WBEM server for the managed device (typically on the device itself) and construct an XML message containing the request.
# the client will use the HTTP (or [[https|HTTPS]]) protocol to pass the request, encoding it in [[CIM-XML]], to the WBEM server
# the WBEM server will decode the incoming request, perform the necessary authentication and authorization checks and then consult the previously defined model of the managed device to see how to handle the request. This model provides the power of the architecture: it represents the pivot point of the transaction, with the client simply interacting with the model and the model interacting with the real hardware or software. The model uses the Common Information Model standard; the [[Distributed Management Task Force|DMTF]] has published many models for commonly managed devices and services: [[multilayer switch|IP routers]], [[file server|storage servers]], [[desktop computer]]s, etc.
# for most operations, the WBEM server determines from the model that it needs to communicate with the actual hardware or software. So-called "providers" handle the interaction: small pieces of code interface between the WBEM server (using a standardised interface known as [[Common Manageability Programming Interface|CMPI]])&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/linuxonibm/liaav/cmpi-overview.pdf The Common Manageability Programming Interface]
&lt;/ref&gt; and the real hardware or software. Because the interface is well-defined and the number of types of call is small, it is normally easy to write providers. In particular, the writer of the provider knows nothing of the GUI, BUI, or CLI used by the operator.

==WBEM specifications==

*Mappings
**[[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] (WBEM URI Mapping Specification 1.0)
**[[XML]] (xmlCIM as used in CIM-XML)
**[[XML]] (WS-CIM as used in WS-Management)
**[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]
*Protocols
**[[CIM-XML]] 
**[[WS-Management]]
**[[CIM-RS]] 
*Discovery
**[[Service Location Protocol|SLP]] (WBEM Discovery using SLP; SLP Template)
*Query Language
**[[CIM_Query_Language|CQL]] (CIM Query Language 1.0)
**[[Filter_Query_Language|FQL]] (Filter Query Language 1.0)

==Implementing support==

So, which pieces of this does a device manufacturer or service provider have to write? 

* Firstly the model.
:This is normally done by extending as necessary one of the standard models published by the [[DMTF]]. 
* Then the BUI, GUI, or CLI. 
:The client and server usually do not need to be written because there are many open-source and commercial implementations available (see [[#External links|External links]] below)
* Then the providers
:In summary, the WBEM architecture allows the manufacturer of a device or developer of a service to provide a standards-compliant management interface to that device simply and cheaply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25319">'''Windows Management Instrumentation''' ('''WMI''') consists of a set of extensions to the [[Windows Driver Model]] that provides an [[operating system]] interface through which [[Instrumentation (computer programming)|instrumented]] components provide information and notification. WMI is [[Microsoft]]'s implementation of the [[Web-Based Enterprise Management]] (WBEM) and [[Common Information Model (computing)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) standards from the [[Distributed Management Task Force]] (DMTF).

WMI allows [[scripting language]]s (such as [[VBScript]] or [[Windows PowerShell]]) to manage [[Microsoft Windows]] [[personal computer]]s and [[Server (computing)|server]]s, both locally and remotely. WMI comes preinstalled in [[Windows 2000]] and in newer Microsoft [[operating systems | OS]]es. It is available as a download for [[Windows NT]],&lt;ref name=WMINTDownload&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C174CFB1-EF67-471D-9277-4C2B1014A31E&amp;displaylang=en|title=WMI Redistributable for Windows NT|author=|date=|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224082551/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c174cfb1-ef67-471d-9277-4c2b1014a31e&amp;DisplayLang=en|archivedate=24 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98]].&lt;ref name=WMIDownload&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=98a4c5ba-337b-4e92-8c18-a63847760ea5&amp;displaylang=en|title=WMI Redistributable for Windows 95 and Windows 98|author=|date=|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223349/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=98a4c5ba-337b-4e92-8c18-a63847760ea5&amp;displaylang=en|archivedate=23 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft also provides a [[command-line interface]] to WMI called '''Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line''' ('''WMIC''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290216 Description of WMIC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502013243/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290216 |date=2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of WMI==

The purpose of WMI is to define a proprietary set of environment-independent specifications which allow management information to be shared between management applications. WMI prescribes [[Systems management|enterprise management]] standards and related technologies for Windows that work with existing management standards, such as [[Desktop Management Interface]] (DMI) and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]]. WMI complements these other standards by providing a uniform model. This model represents the managed environment through which management data from any source can be accessed in a common way.

==Development process==
Because WMI abstracts the manageable entities with CIM and a collection of providers, the development of a provider implies several steps. The major steps can be summarized as follows:

# Create the manageable entity model
## Define a model
## Implement the model
# Create the WMI provider
## Determine the provider type to implement
## Determine the hosting model of the provider
## Create the provider template with the ATL wizard
## Implement the code logic in the provider
## Register the provider with WMI and the system
# Test the provider
# Create consumer sample code.

==Importance of WMI providers==
Since the release of the first WMI implementation during the [[Windows NT 4.0]] SP4 era (as an out-of-band download), Microsoft has consistently added WMI providers to Windows:

* Under Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft had roughly 15 WMI providers available once WMI was installed
* When [[Windows 2000]] was released, there were 29 WMI providers as part of the operating system installation
* With the release of [[Windows Server 2003]], Microsoft included in the platform more than 80 WMI providers
* [[Windows Vista]] includes 13 new WMI providers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/e/3/be37cbce-425e-45c2-a9f5-378026b5be81/04-d-WinMgmtTech-v03-TOURB-FINAL.ppt|title=Windows Vista Client Manageability|author=|date=|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175059/http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/e/3/be37cbce-425e-45c2-a9f5-378026b5be81/04-d-WinMgmtTech-v03-TOURB-FINAL.ppt|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking the number close to around 100 in all
* [[Windows Server 2008]] includes more providers, including providers for IIS 7, [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]] and virtualization
* [[Windows 10]] includes 47 providers for the [[Mobile Device Management]] (MDM) service.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web |url= https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/wmi-providers-supported-in-windows#mdm-wmi-classes |title= WMI providers supported in Windows 10 | access-date = 30 September 2018 | date= 25 June 2017  | website= [[Microsoft]] | format= html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180930123815/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/wmi-providers-supported-in-windows | archive-date= 20 September 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Many customers{{which|date=January 2013}} have interpreted the growth in numbers of providers as a sign that WMI has become at Microsoft the "ubiquitous" management layer of Windows, even if Microsoft has never made this commitment explicit.

Because of a constant increasing exposure of management data through WMI in Windows, people in the [[information technology|IT]] [[systems management]] field started to develop scripts and automation procedures based on WMI.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Beyond the scripting needs, most leading management-software packages, such as [[Microsoft Operations Manager|MOM]], [[System Center Configuration Manager|SCCM]], ADS, [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] [[OpenView]] for Windows (HPOV), [[BMC Software]] or [[CA, Inc.]] are WMI-enabled and capable of consuming and providing WMI information through various ''User Interfaces''. This enables [[system administrator|administrators]] and operators not capable of scripting or programming on top of WMI to enjoy the benefits of WMI without even learning about it. However, if they want to, because WMI is scriptable, it gives them the opportunity to consume WMI information from scripts or from any WMI-aware [[Enterprise management|enterprise-management]] software.

==Features==

For someone willing to develop one or many WMI providers, WMI offers many features out of the box. Here are the most important advantages:

# ''Automation interfaces:'' &lt;br/&gt; Because WMI comes with a set of automation interfaces ready to use, all management features supported by a WMI provider and its set of classes get the scripting support for free out-of-the box. Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate and test a scripting model as it is already available from WMI.
# ''[[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] Management interfaces:'' &lt;br/&gt; Because the System.Management namespace &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.aspx|title=System.Management Namespace|author=|date=|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416233646/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.aspx|archivedate=16 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the existing [[Component Object Model|COM]]/[[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] plumbing, the created WMI provider and its set of WMI classes becomes automatically available to all .NET applications independently of the language used (e.g. [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]]). Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, like for scripting, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate and test new assemblies to support a new namespace in the .NET Framework as this support is already available from WMI for free.
# ''C/C++ COM/DCOM programming interfaces:'' &lt;br/&gt; Like most components in Windows, COM/DCOM programmers can leverage the features of the provider they develop at the COM/DCOM interfaces level. Like in previous environments (scripting and [[.NET Framework]]), a COM/DCOM consumer just needs to interact with the standard set of WMI COM interfaces to leverage the WMI provider capabilities and its set of supported WMI classes. To make all management information available from the native APIs, the WMI provider developer just needs to interact with a set of pre-defined WMI COM interfaces. This will make the management information available at the WMI COM level automatically. Moreover, the scripting COM interface object model is very similar to the COM/DCOM interface object model, which makes it easy for developers to be familiar with the scripting experience.
# ''Remoting capabilities over DCOM and [[SOAP]]:'' &lt;br/&gt; More than simply offering local COM capabilities, as management is all about [[Remote procedure call|remoting]], WMI offers the DCOM transport. In addition, SOAP transport will be available in [[Windows Server 2003]] '''R2''' through the [[WS-Management]] initiative led by [[Microsoft]], [[Intel]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Dell]]. This initiative allows running any scripts remotely or to consume WMI data through a specific set of interfaces handling SOAP requests/responses. The advantage for the WMI provider developer is that when he exposes all his features through WMI, ''Windows Remote Management''/WS-Management can in turn consume that information as well (embedded objects in WMI instances are not supported in Windows Server 2003 R2. It is however a target for Vista). All the layering to WS-Management and the mapping of the CIM data model to SOAP comes for free out of the WMI/WS-Management solution. In the event DCOM must be used, implementing DCOM requires the presence of a proxy DLL deployed on each client machine. As WMI is available in the Windows operating system since Windows 2000, these issues are eliminated.
# ''Support for Queries:'' &lt;br/&gt; WMI offers support for [[WQL]]&lt;ref name=WQLviaPowerShell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/publications/ebook-wmi-query-language-wql-via-powersahell/|title=WMI query language (WQL) via PowerShell|author=|date=1 May 2011|website=ravichaganti.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012210736/http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/publications/ebook-wmi-query-language-wql-via-powersahell/|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; queries out of the box. This means that if a provider is not designed to support queries, WMI supports it by using an enumeration technique out of the provider.
# ''Eventing capabilities:'' &lt;br/&gt; WMI offers the capability to notify a subscriber for any event it is interested in. WMI uses the WMI Query Language (WQL) to submit WQL event queries and defines the type of events to be returned. The eventing mechanism, with all related callbacks, is part of the WMI COM/DCOM and automation interfaces. Anyone writing a WMI provider can have the benefit of this functionality at no cost for his customers. It will be up to the consumer to decide how it wants to consume the management information exposed by the WMI provider and its related set of WMI classes.
# ''Code template generator:'' &lt;br/&gt; To speed up the process of writing a WMI provider including all COM/DCOM interfaces and related definitions, the WMI team developed the ''WMI ATL Wizard'' to generate the code template implementing a provider. The code generated is based on the WMI class model initially designed by the developer. The WMI provider developer will be able to interface the pre-defined COM/DCOM interfaces for the WMI provider with its set of native APIs retrieving the management information to expose. The exercise consists in filling the “gaps” in the provider code to create the desired interfacing logic.
# ''Predictability:'' &lt;br/&gt; Predictability is an important concern for IT professionals because it defines the capability of someone having an experience with a set of interfaces managing a Windows component to apply this knowledge right away, intuitively, to any other manageable Windows component without having relearn everything from ground up. Predictability for a customer is a real gain as it increases the Return of Investment ([[Rate of return|ROI]]). A person facing such a situation simply expects things to work the same way based on his previous experience. The constant increase of COM programming/scriptable interfaces has a huge impact on the predictability, as this makes it difficult for customers to automate, manage Windows and leverage their existing knowledge. WMI with CIM address this problem by always exposing the same programming object model (COM/DCOM, Automation, .NET) whatever the manageable entity is.
# ''Protect existing customer investments:'' &lt;br/&gt; Protecting customers and partners investment motivates customers to invest in technologies. As Microsoft did invest a lot these past years in writing WMI providers, customers and partners invested in tools leveraging the WMI capabilities of Windows. Therefore, they naturally continue to exploit these capabilities instead of having to use a new set of specific interfaces for each Windows manageable component. A specific set of interfaces means having a specific set of agents or in-house developed software based on a new model or set of interfaces especially dedicated to a component or technology. By leveraging the capabilities of WMI today, customers and partners can leverage the work investment made in the past while minimizing their costs in developments, learning curves and new discoveries. This will also have a great impact on the stability and reliability of their infrastructure as they continue to leverage an existing implementation with an improved technology.
# ''Provide a logical and unified administration model:'' &lt;br/&gt; As briefly described before in the introduction, this model is based on an industry standard called CIM defined by the DMTF (http://www.dmtf.org). The CIM class-based schema is defined by a consortium of constructors and software developers that meets the requirements of the industry. This implies that not only Microsoft leverages the WMI capabilities, but also any other third party constructors or developers write their own code to fit into the model. For instance, Intel is doing this for some of their network driver adapters and software. HP is leveraging existing WMI providers and implementing their own WMI providers in their HP Open View [[Systems management|Enterprise Management]] software. IBM consumes WMI from the [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli]] management suite, MOM and SMS are also consuming and providing WMI information. Lastly, Windows XP SP2 leverages WMI to get information status from anti-virus software and firewalls.

==WMI tools==
Some WMI tools can also be useful during the design and development phases. These tools are:

* ''The MOF compiler (MOFComp.exe):'' The Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler parses a file containing Managed Object Format statements and adds the classes and class instances defined in the file to the CIM repository. The MOF format is a specific syntax to define CIM class representation in an [[ASCII]] file (e.g. MIB are to SNMP what MOF files are to CIM). MOFComp.exe is included in every WMI installation. Every definition existing in the CIM repository is initially defined in an MOF file. MOF files are located in %SystemRoot%\System32\WBEM. During the WMI setup, they are loaded in the CIM repository.
* ''The WMI Administrative Tools:'' The WMI Administrative Tools are made of four tools: WMI CIM Studio, WMI Object Browser, WMI Event Registration and WMI Event Viewer. The most important tool for a WMI provider developer is WMI CIM Studio as it helps in the initial WMI class creation in the CIM repository. It uses a web interface to display information and relies on a collection of [[ActiveX]] components installed on the system when it runs for the first time. WMI CIM Studio provides the ability to:
** Connect to a chosen system and browse the CIM repository in any namespace available.
** Search for classes by their name, by their descriptions or by property names.
** Review the properties, methods and associations related to a given class.
** See the instances available for a given class of the examined system.
** Perform Queries in the WQL language.
** Generate an MOF file based on selected classes.
** Compile an MOF file to load it in the CIM repository.
* ''WinMgmt.exe:'' WinMgmt.exe is not a tool; it is the executable that implements the WMI Core service. Under the Windows NT family of operating systems, WMI runs as a service. On computers running Windows 98, Windows 95 or Windows Me, WMI runs as an application. Under the Windows NT family of operating systems, it is also possible to run this executable as an application, in which case, the executable runs in the current user context. For this, the WMI service must be stopped first. The executable supports some switches that can be useful when starting WMI as a service or as an application. WMI provider developers who may want to debug their providers essentially need to run the WMI service as an application.&lt;ref name=mswmitasks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394588.aspx|title=WMI Tasks: Computer Software (Windows)|author=|date=|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406140306/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394588.aspx|archivedate=6 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''WBEMTest.exe:'' WBEMTest.exe is a WMI tester tool, which is delivered with WMI. This tool allows an administrator or a developer to perform most of the tasks from a graphical interface that WMI provides at the [[API]] level. Although available under all Windows NT-based operating systems, this tool is not officially supported by Microsoft. WBEMTest provides the ability to:
** Enumerate, open, create and delete classes.
** Enumerate, open, create and delete instances of classes.
** Select a namespace.
** Perform data and event queries.
** Execute methods associated to classes or instances.
** Execute every WMI operation asynchronously, synchronously or semi-asynchronously.
* The WMI command line tool (WMIC): WMIC is a command-line tool designed to ease WMI information retrieval about a system by using some simple keywords (aliases). WMIC.exe is only available under Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. By typing “WMIC /?” from the command-line, a complete list of the switches and reserved keywords is available.
** There is a Linux port of WMI command line tool, written in Python, based on [[Samba4]] called 'wmi-client'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/wmi-client|title=Ubuntu – Error|first=Rhonda D'Vine,|last=rhonda@ubuntu.com|date=|website=packages.ubuntu.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194634/http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python/wmi-client|archivedate=2 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''WBEMDump.exe:'' WBEMDump is a tool delivered with the [[Microsoft Windows SDK|Platform SDK]]. This command line tool comes with its own Visual C++ project. The tool can show the CIM repository classes, instances, or both. It is possible to retrieve the same information as that retrieved with WMIC. WBEMDump.exe requires more specific knowledge about WMI, as it doesn’t abstract WMI as WMIC. However, it runs under Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. It is also possible to execute methods exposed by classes or instances. Even if it is not a standard WMI tool delivered with the system installation, this tool can be quite useful for exploring the CIM repository and WMI features.
* ''WMIDiag.vbs:''  The WMI Diagnosis Tool is a VBScript downloadable from Microsoft [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=62562 here] and is a tool for testing and validating WMI on Windows 2000 and greater. The download includes pretty thorough documentation and the tool supports numerous switches.  When run, it will generate up to four text files which: list the steps taken (the LOG file), an overview of the results (REPORT file), a statistics file (in comma separated values format), and optionally a file listing of the providers registered on the machine (PROVIDERS, also in comma separated values format).  The report file that is generated includes a list of the issues identified and potential ways to fix them.
* ''WMI Explorer:''  The WMI Explorer Tool is a freely available and opensource program downloadable [https://github.com/vinaypamnani/wmie2/releases here] and is a tool for enumerating and querying WMI providers in a graphical user interface. 

==Wireless networking example==

In the [[.NET framework]], the ManagementClass class represents a Common Information Model (CIM) management class. A WMI class can be a Win32_LogicalDisk in the case of a disk drive, or a Win32_Process, such as a running program like Notepad.exe.

This example shows how "MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier" WMI class is used to find the [[SSID]] of the [[Wi-Fi]] network that the system is currently connected to in the language C#:

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;

ManagementClass mc = new ManagementClass("root\\WMI", "MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier", null);
ManagementObjectCollection moc = mc. GetInstances();
   
foreach (ManagementObject mo in moc)
{
    string wlanCard = (string)mo["InstanceName"];
    bool active;
    if (!bool.TryParse((string)mo["Active"], out active))
    {
       active = false;
    }
    byte[] ssid = (byte[])mo["Ndis80211SsId"];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The "MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier" WMI class is only supported on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

==WMI driver extensions==
The WMI extensions to [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] provide kernel-level [[Instrumentation (computer programming)|instrumentation]] such as publishing information, configuring device settings, supplying event notification from [[device driver]]s and allowing administrators to set data security through a WMI provider known as the ''WDM provider''. The extensions are part of the WDM architecture; however, they have broad utility and can be used with other types of drivers as well (such as [[SCSI]] and [[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]]). The WMI Driver Extensions service monitors all drivers and event trace providers that are configured to publish WMI or event trace information. Instrumented hardware data is provided by way of drivers instrumented for WMI extensions for WDM. WMI extensions for WDM provide a set of Windows device driver interfaces for instrumenting data within the driver models native to Windows, so [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s and [[Independent hardware vendor|IHV]]s can easily extend the instrumented data set and add value to a hardware/software solution. The WMI Driver Extensions, however, are not supported by [[Windows Vista]] and later operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480152.aspx#appcomp_topic16|title=The Windows Vista and Windows "Longhorn" Server Developer Story: Application Compatibility Cookbook|author=|date=|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421122427/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480152.aspx#appcomp_topic16|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
