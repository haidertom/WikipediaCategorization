Anegundi, believed to be the ''monkey kingdom'' of [[Kishkindha]] (''Kishkinta'' means in local language ''a forest where the monkeys lived'') in the epic of [[Ramayana]], is at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km from the historical site of Hampi. Anjanadri hill, the birthplace of monkey-god [[Hanuman]], and the mountain Rishimuka are the other places near Anegundi associated with Ramayana. It is said to have one of the oldest plateaus on the planet, estimated to be 3,000 million years old. So, only local story-tellers refer to Anegundi as the maternal home of Bhoodevi (Mother Earth).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first capital of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and capital of several other dynasties. In 1334, Deva Raya the Chief Minister of Anegundi became ruler of Anegundi. When [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultans]] invaded [[Warangal]], ''Harihara and Bukka'' escaped and came to Anegundi, later founded the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] at [[Hampi]].

===Rural tourism scheme===
Realising that to appreciate and be involved in conserving ancient lineage and historic surroundings, the villagers of Anegundi must be self-sufficient with sustainable economic support, the Union government under its ''rural tourism'' scheme, formed a trust named Kishkindha to build capacity in the villagers to maintain business incubators.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}

The main activities taken up engaging the locals, were improving the village surroundings through landscaping, developing parks and gardens, putting up fences and constructing compound walls, laying roads within the panchayat limits, fixing street lights, managing solid waste and sewerage, procuring equipment required for water sports and adventure sports, introducing eco-friendly modes of transport for moving within the tourism zone and setting up reception centres.

To meet contemporary needs of tourists, traditional houses in the village were converted into guest houses without disturbing their ancient looks. The villagers are earning a handsome amount by renting out these houses to the tourists.

They have also set up a craft shop offering a range of items made locally using banana fibre, an Internet cafe to help visitors keep in touch with the outer world and a restaurant to treat their taste buds. Local art forms have also been revived to entertain the visitors.

The '''''Battle of Grunwald''''' is a painting by [[Jan Matejko]] depicting the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the victory of the allied [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] over the [[Teutonic Order]] in 1410. The canvas dates to 1878 and is one of the most heroic representations of the history of [[history of Poland|Poland]] and [[history of Lithuania|Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=bd/&gt; It is displayed in the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]].

The painting's main focus is the death scene of the [[Grand Master of the Teutonic Order]], [[Ulrich von Jungingen]]; another central figure is the Lithuanian grand duke [[Vytautas the Great]], dressed in red with a raised sword. The painting has been both hailed and criticized for its complexity. It is one of Matejko's most recognizable works, and has likely contributed to the popular image of the battle of Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.

==History==
[[File:Bitwa pod Grunwaldem Muzeum Narodowe 05.JPG|thumb|''The Battle of Grunwald'' displayed in the National Museum in Warsaw]]
[[File:Prussian Homage.jpg|thumb|''Prussian Homage.'']]
Matejko began collecting materials for the painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt; Soon afterwards, he received a [[scepter]] from the council of [[Kraków]] in an official ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position as one of the most respected Polish artists.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; The painting was sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a private individual in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="hm"/&gt; Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the painting was bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the [[Zachęta|Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts]] (''Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych'') and displayed in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="hm"/&gt;

Like many other works, the ''Battle of Grunwald'' was hidden during the [[occupation of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt; Together with ''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Homage]]'', it was one of the two artworks that topped the "most wanted" paintings list made by the [[Nazi]]s, who engaged in a systematic action of [[Polish culture during World War II|physical destruction of all artifacts of Polish culture]].&lt;ref name=bd/&gt;&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr2"/&gt; [[Goebbels]] offered a bounty of 10 million [[Deutsche Mark|marks]] for it, and several members of the [[Polish resistance in World War II|Polish Underground]] were executed by the Germans when they refused to divulge its location despite interrogation and torture.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt; The painting survived the war years hidden near [[Lublin]].&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;

Restored after World War II, since 1949 this [[oil painting]] has been on display in the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=hm/&gt; In 1999 the ''Battle of Grunwald'' was loaned to Lithuania, where it garnered a positive reception because it prominently features [[Vytautas]], who is considered a national hero in that country.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; By the 2000s, the painting needed restoration. In 2010, the poor condition of the painting prevented its inclusion in a special exhibition at [[Wawel Castle]] to mark the 600th anniversary of the battle.&lt;ref name="dziennik"/&gt; The painting was renovated, with the work finished in 2012. After restoration the painting is once again on display at the National Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Centrum Informacyjne MKiDN |url=http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/pages/posts/dzielo-matejki-ocalone-dla-potomnych-3256.php |title=Dzieło Matejki ocalone dla potomnych Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego - 2012 |publisher=Mkidn.gov.pl |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

The ''Battle of Grunwald'' is a painting by Matejko that portrays events from the [[history of Poland]] and [[history of Lithuania|Lithuania]],&lt;ref name="ScalesZimmer2005"/&gt; the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the struggles of Eastern European principalities against [[Teutonic knights]] in general. In the center of the painting is the Lithuanian grand duke [[Vytautas the Great]] (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. Vytautas holds a more prominent position in the painting than his cousin, Polish king [[Władysław Jagiełło]] (Jogaila), who is visible in the second plan, mounted, in the top right side.&lt;ref name="ScalesZimmer2005"/&gt; According to Scales and Zimmer, by focusing on Vytautas rather than Jagiełło, Matejko stressed the importance of Lithuania for Poland, and the value of cooperation between the two countries in the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]].&lt;ref name="ScalesZimmer2005"/&gt; Others have noted that this placement likely was influenced by Matejko's reliance on the writings of [[Jan Długosz]], who attributed greater importance to Vytautas than to Jagiełło, who, by some polish sources, commanded the battle.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; While Lithuanian sources claim that Vytautas The Great have got the very major role in the battle by actually commanding troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istorijoszurnalas.lt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=357&amp;Itemid=351 Tomas Baranauskas. Žalgirio mūšis Lietuvos istorikų darbuose]&lt;/ref&gt; In the skies above the carnage, [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Saint Stanislaus]], a patron of Poland, overlooks the fighting.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt;

Another central scene depicts death of the [[Grand Master of the Teutonic Order]], [[Ulrich von Jungingen]]. Dressed in white Order garb and riding a white horse, von Jungingen is being killed by two anonymous figures, which historian of art [[Danuta Batorska]] identifies as "savage looking Lithuanian peasants".&lt;ref name=bd/&gt; One of them wields a [[Saint Maurice Spear]] (one of the objects with the claim to be the [[Spear of Destiny]]), which according to historian of art [[Jarosław Krawczyk]] implies that Matejko saw Jungingen's death as a retribution for taking arms against another Christian ruler.&lt;ref name="gw1"/&gt; Next to the spearman is an [[executioner]], who symbolizes the punishment Jungingen receives for the Order raids and pillages against the common folk.&lt;ref name=gw1/&gt; Those symbolic figures are one of many liberal interpretation that Matejko took with his painting; furthermore, modern scholarship indicates that he died in a cavalry duel, and not at the hands of a peasant.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;

Other notable figures depicted in the painting include:
* [[Marcin of Wrocimowice]], Polish knight, is holding the Polish banner in the center, next to [[Vytautas]];&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw2/&gt;
* [[Zyndram of Maszkowice]], another Polish knight, is holding a sword over von Jungingen's head;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gw2"/&gt;
* [[Mikołaj Skunarowski]] (also known as Skunaczewski) is another Polish knight, standing  next to Zyndram; after the battle he would be sent with the capture standard to Kraków, as a symbol of victory;&lt;ref name=gw2/&gt;
* [[Werner von Tettingen]], German knight and one of the Teutonic Order's leaders, witnesses his leader's death from the left side of the painting;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw1/&gt;
* near von Tettingen, [[Casimir V, Duke of Pomerania]], an ally of the Order, is taken prisoner by the knight [[Jakub Skarbek]] z Góry and his squire;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw1/&gt;
* at the bottom, [[Konrad VII the White]] is taken prisoner, and [[Kuno von Lichtenstein]] is dying. Matejko portrayed Konrad as a traitor, whereas German knight von Lichtenstein is shown dying with honor;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw2/&gt;
* to the right, [[Jan Žižka]], a Czech ally of Poland, is killing a German knight [[Heinrich von Schwelborn]];&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw2/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* next to Žižka, [[Zawisza Czarny]] is taking down another German knight;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* to the right of Zawisza, in a shining steel helmet, is another Polish knight, [[Domarat Grzymalczyk]]  of Kobylany, later a castellan of [[Lublin]];&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* German knight [[Marquard von Salzbach]] is captured by a wild looking warrior identified as a [[Tatar]]&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; or a [[Cossack]];&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* another German knight is clutching von Salzbach's garb, this is [[Johan von Wenden]];&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* future Grand Master [[Heinrich von Plauen]] is to the right of the painting as well, escaping to organize the defense of the remains of the Order's territory;&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gw3"/&gt;
* behind von Plauen is a figure Matejko identified as ''Krzysztof, bishop of Lübeck''. Modern historians have however failed to associate this figure with any historical person, noting that there was no bishop of this or similar time at contemporary Lübeck;&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* to the right of von Plauen is a Polish knight and dignitary [[Jan Długosz of Niedzielsk]], father of the chronicler [[Jan Długosz]];&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;
* future [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki]] is shown as one of Jagiełło's advisers.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; Near Władysław are also: his relative, [[Zygmunt Korybut]], Deputy Chancellor of the Crown, [[Mikołaj Trąba]], [[Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia]].&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt; On the ground under Oleśnicki is the body of the German knight [[Dippold Kikeritz]] who tried to charge Jagiełło, but was fallen by his entourage.&lt;ref name=gw3/&gt;

Matejko combined three key parts of the battle into one tableau: an opportunistic attack by German knight Kökeritz on Jagiełło, the death of the Grand Master, and the taking of the Teutonic camp (in the top left corner).&lt;ref name="ScalesZimmer2005"/&gt; Unlike many other paintings of battles, the ''Battle of Grunwald'' does not separate the viewer from the action; instead it places him at the center of it.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt; Matejko said he felt like a "possessed man" while he made the painting.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt;

Matejko based the painting in part on a description of the battle in Długosz' chronicles, which accounts for several historical inaccuracies.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; At the same time, he was meticulous about correctly depicting the terrain of the battle, having visited the site of the conflict in 1877.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Wyspianski - grunwald.gif|thumb|right|Wyspiański's parody of the painting]]
The painting has been called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene,&lt;ref name="Wałek1988"/&gt; and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it.&lt;ref name=bd/&gt; At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt; Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;

The painting can be seen as Matejko's warning to [[Otto von Bismarck]], whose [[Germanization]] policies ([[Kulturkampf]]) targeted [[Polish culture]], reminding him of the Polish victory over the Teutons.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt; Overall, the painting was intended to raise the spirits of the Polish people during the period when Poland had been [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] and no longer existed as an independent state.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;

The painting, one of Matejko's most recognizable works and one of the best known paintings in Poland, likely has contributed to the popular image of the battle of Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt; The painting inspired [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], who mentioned it in several of his works.&lt;ref name="mr"/&gt;

'''''Behind the Scenes''''' was a 10-part television [[miniseries]] aimed towards 8- to 12-year-olds about various aspects of [[the arts]], that was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-12/entertainment/ca-1615_1_children-s-arts-series |title=PBS Slates Children's Arts Series : Television: Penn &amp; Teller will host 'Behind the Scenes,' aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds. It premieres in September. - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1992-02-12 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |first=Jane |last=Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was executive produced by [[Alice Stewart Trillin]] and [[Jane Garmey]], produced and directed by [[Ellen Hovde]] and [[Muffie Meyer]], and hosted by [[Penn &amp; Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlemarch.com/filmography/behind-the-scenes/ |title=Behind the Scenes &amp;#124; Middlemarch Films |publisher=Middlemarch.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to illuminate the creative process underlying the working of artists.

==Style==
The show used a wide variety of short films, computer animation, and music to illustrate certain abstractions associated with the artistic process. Each of Penn &amp; Teller's skits were specifically geared towards demonstrating an aspect of that episode's theme.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'To show rhythmic patterns in a song, we produce a mouse each time the pattern goes one way and when there is a variation, we produce a frog,' Teller said. 'This continues until there are quite a number of mice and frogs all over the place.'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Penn and Teller said they didn't want to talk down to the series' young viewers. 'Kids tend to be desperately curious,' Teller said. 'There is a certain element we are doing in this that is making the analogy between the arts and a magic trick. When you think of something like perspective in a painting, it really is a magic trick.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-06/news/tv-499_1_creative-skills |title=Tricks for Kids : Penn and Teller host PBS series aimed at boosting creative skills - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1992-09-06 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |first=Susan |last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[file:Burin-Parts.jpg|thumb|A diagram of a burin showing its component parts: the handle, shaft, cutting tip and face&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://porcuprints.com/printmaking/ |title=Porcuprints-Printmaking |accessdate=2011-08-06 |author= Alexia Rostow |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[engraving]], a '''burin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|juː|r|ɪ|n}}, from the [[French language|French]] ''burin'', also used for "cold [[chisel]]s") is a [[steel]] cutting tool which is the essential tool of the form.

== Design ==

The burin consists of a rounded handle shaped like a mushroom, and a tempered steel shaft, coming from the handle at an angle, and ending in a very sharp cutting face.

Burins typically have a square or lozenge shape face, though several other types are used. A tint burin consists of a square face with teeth, enabling the creation of many fine, closely spaced lines. A stipple tool allows for the creation of  fine dots. A flat burin consists of a rectangular face, and is used for cutting away large portions of material at a time.

== Uses ==
[[file:Goltzius's right Hand.jpg|thumb|The malformed hand of [[Hendrik Goltzius]], which was especially suited to the use of a burin]]

An engraving burin is used predominantly by [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] engravers, but also by [[Relief printing|relief]] [[printmaker]]s in making [[wood engraving]]s. Its older English name, still often used, is ''graver''.  Usually an engraver will have several tools, of different sizes and shapes of cutting face.

In use, it is typically held at approximately a 30-degree angle to the surface. The index and middle finger typically guide the shaft, while the handle is cradled in the palm. Of note is the 16th-century Flemish engraver [[Hendrik Goltzius]], whose malformed hand was ideally suited for the cradling and guiding of a burin.

The '''Buzzy Bee''' is a popular [[toy]] in [[New Zealand]]. It resembles a [[bee]] with rotating [[wing]]s that move and make a clicking noise while the toy is pulled along the ground. Possibly based on an earlier American concept,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_9661"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=9661 |title=Nasty sting in the tale of 'our' Buzzy Bee icon |date=8 July 1999 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was designed and first produced in New Zealand in the 1930s, by [[Maurice Schlesinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Tony (2007). ''101 Incredible Kiwis: How New Zealanders Lead the World.'' Auckland: Reed Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It became popular during the [[post-war]] [[baby boom]]. Its bright colours and clicking sound call are familiar to many New Zealanders, making it one of the most well-recognised items of [[Kiwiana]].   Since this time however, the Buzzy Bee has branched out into various merchandise including books, jigsaws and clothing.

It received a good deal of free promotion with the visit of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] in 1983 with their infant son, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William of Wales]], who played with a Buzzy Bee.

As an iconic New Zealand symbol, the Buzzy Bee caricature was used on the keel of NZL84, one of [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Team New Zealand]]'s entrant yachts for the [[America's Cup]] held in [[Valencia, Spain]], in 2007.

In June 2007, plans were unveiled for a Buzzy Bee stage show ''"Buzzy Bee's Big Day Out"''. The company behind the show also revealed that they'd made an animated show reel and were finalising details of a distribution deal, and that they hoped to begin work on an animated series for television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/author/story.cfm?a_id=328&amp;objectid=10441111 |title=Multi-million dollar Buzzy Bee stage show to hit the road |author=Joanna Hunkin |publisher=NZ Herald |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The animated TV show ''Buzzy Bee and Friends'' has aired on TV2 from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Show |url=https://buzzybeetv.com/videos/tv/ |work=Buzzy Bee and friends |publisher=Lion Rock Ventures |accessdate=2 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208061906/https://buzzybeetv.com/videos/tv/ |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fisher-Price]] manufactured Buzzy Bees from 1950 to 1956.  [http://www.thisoldtoy.com/new-images/images-ok/300-399/fp325-bee.jpg Buzzy Bee] was originally covered with paper lithographs depicting a yellow bee with pink cheeks, blue eyes, and striped tail. The bee had two spring antennae topped with red beads.  Yellow acetate wings rotated and the toy made a "buzz-buzz" sound as it was pulled along on two wooden wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisoldtoy.com/L_FP_Set/toy-pages/300-399/325-buzzybee.html Buzzy Bee] This Old Toy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, Mark. ''Warman's 101 Greatest Baby Boomer Toys.'' kp books, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Buzzy Bee cost $.59 and was Fisher-Price's first toy to feature plastic.  The toy was retired for a few years but returned in 1956 as Queen Buzzy Bee wearing a polyethylene crown. Queen Buzzy was manufactured through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

The '''Byam Shaw School of Art''', often known simply as '''Byam Shaw''', was an independent art school in London, England, which specialised in fine art and offered foundation and degree level courses. It was founded in 1910 by [[Byam Shaw|John Liston Byam Shaw]] and [[Rex Vicat Cole]]. In 2003 it was absorbed by [[Central Saint Martins|Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design]].

== History ==

The Byam Shaw was opened in May 1910 by John Liston Byam Shaw and Rex Vicat Cole with the name Byam Shaw and Vicat Cole School of Art. The teaching staff initially consisted of W. Dacres Adams, D. Murray Smith and C. Austin Cooper; additional lectures were given by Evelyn Eunice Pyke-Nott (Mrs. Byam Shaw), Kenneth Martin and Percival Silley.{{r|gladys}}

Other early members of the staff were [[Francis Ernest Jackson|Ernest Jackson]], who was principal of the school from 1926 to 1940,{{r|tate}} and the late [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]]. The original premises were at 70 Campden Street, London W8; the school moved in 1990 to larger premises in Archway.{{r|artbio|axis}}

The '''Carbuncle Cup''' is an architecture prize, given annually by the magazine ''[[Building Design]]'' to "the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months".&lt;ref name=bd2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/six-in-race-for-carbuncle-cup/5003099.article |title=Six in race for Carbuncle Cup |date=22 July 2010 |author=Watson, Anna |publisher=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to be a humorous response to the prestigious [[Stirling Prize]],&lt;ref name=bd2008 /&gt; given by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAStirlingPrize/RIBAStirlingPrize.aspx |title=RIBA Stirling Prize |publisher=RIBA |accessdate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930145808/http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAStirlingPrize/RIBAStirlingPrize.aspx |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was launched in 2006, with the first winner being [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre]] in [[Plymouth]] by [[Chapman Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article1290884.ece |title=The malling of our cities |work=The Times |date=10 January 2007 |author=Dyckhoff, Tom |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortlist is announced by the periodical each year, based on nominations from the public, and usually in the same week as the Stirling Prize shortlist. Free voting via the magazine's website was at first used to select the winner. Since 2009 a small group of critics has selected the winner.

The award was inspired by the [[Carbuncle Awards]] of Scottish architecture magazine ''[[Urban Realm]]'', formerly ''Prospect'', had been presenting to buildings and areas in Scotland since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles/2005/The_Carbuncle_Awards_2005.html |title=The Carbuncle Awards 2005 |author= Urban Realm |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names derive from a comment by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], an opponent of certain modernist styles and forms and a staunch defender of existing characterisations, themes and points of interest, who in 1984 described [[Ahrends, Burton and Koralek]]'s proposed extension of London's [[National Gallery]] as a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration|title=Life after carbuncles|first=Jonathan|last=Glancey|date=17 May 2004|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|title=A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace|accessdate=2007-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">[[File:Conway criterion prototile.pdf|thumb|360px|A prototile which satisfies the Conway criterion.  The four midpoints of centrosymmetric symmetry are indicated by black dots.]]
In the mathematical theory of [[tessellations]], the '''Conway criterion''', named for the English mathematician [[John Horton Conway]], describes rules for when a [[prototile]] will tile the plane; it consists of the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt;''Will It Tile? Try the Conway Criterion!'' by Doris Schattschneider Mathematics Magazine Vol. 53, No. 4 (Sep., 1980), pp. 224-233&lt;/ref&gt;   The tile must be a [[Topological disc#Topological balls|closed topological disk]]  with six consecutive points A, B, C, D, E, and F on the boundary such that: 
* the boundary part from A to B is congruent by translation to the boundary part from E to D
* each of the boundary parts BC, CD, EF, and FA is [[Centrosymmetry|centrosymmetric]]—that is, each one is congruent to itself when rotated by 180-degrees around its midpoint
* some of the six points may coincide but at least three of them must be distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grahamshawcross.com/2012/10/12/periodic-and-non-periodic-tiling/ Periodic Tiling:  Polygons in General]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any prototile satisfying Conway's criterion admits a [[periodic tiling]] of the plane—and does so using only translation and 180-degree rotations. The Conway criterion is a sufficient condition to prove that a prototile tiles the plane but not a necessary one; there are tiles that fail the criterion and still tile the plane.&lt;ref name=rhoads&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042704002195 | doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329–353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Isohedral tiling p6-7.png|thumb|A [[hexagonal tiling#Topologically identical tilings|hexagonal tiling]] with centrosymmetric hexagons]]
[[File:Conway criterion false negative nonominoes.svg|thumb|The two nonominoes not satisfying the Conway criterion but able to tile the plane]]
In its simplest form the criterion states that any [[hexagon]] with a pair of opposite sides that are parallel and congruent will tessellate the plane by translation, called hexagonal [[parallelogon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Polyominoes: A Guide to Puzzles and Problems in Tiling'', by George Martin, Mathematical Association of America, Washington, DC, 1991, p. 152, {{ISBN|0883855011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But when some of the points coincide, the criterion can apply to other polygons and even to shapes with curved perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathforamerica.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=11&amp;name=DLFE-103.pdf The five types of Conway Criterion polygon tile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706175448/http://www.mathforamerica.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=11&amp;name=DLFE-103.pdf |date=2012-07-06 }}, PDF file&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conway criterion discriminates many shapes, especially [[polyforms]]: except the two tiling [[nonomino]]es on the right, all tiling [[polyomino]]s up to the nonominoes can form a patch of at least one tile which satisfies the criterion.&lt;ref name=rhoads/&gt; These figures also show that the criterion is a sufficient but not necessary condition for a prototile to tile the plane.

[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|Roman bronze reduction of Myron's ''Discobolus'', 2nd century AD ([[Glyptothek]], Munich)]]
[[File:Diskoskasteren (Discobolos) - KAS1549.stl|thumb|3D model of a replica at [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Denmark.]]
The '''''Discobolus''''' of [[Myron]] ("[[discus thrower]]", {{lang-el|Δισκοβόλος}}, ''Diskobólos'') is a Greek [[sculpture]] completed at the start of the Classical Period, figuring a youthful ancient Greek athlete throwing discus, circa 460–450&amp;nbsp;BC. The original Greek bronze is lost but the work is known through numerous Roman copies, both full-scale ones in marble, which was cheaper than bronze,&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Woodford, Susan. (1982) ''The Art of Greece and Rome''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 16. {{ISBN|0521298733}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the first to be recovered, the ''Palombara Discobolus'', and smaller scaled versions in bronze.

A discus thrower depicted is about to release his throw: "by sheer intelligence", [[Kenneth Clark]] observed in ''The Nude'', "Myron has created the enduring pattern of athletic energy. He has taken a moment of action so transitory that students of athletics still debate if it is feasible, and he has given it the completeness of a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]."&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]]. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The moment thus captured in the statue is an example of ''rhythmos'', harmony and balance. Myron is often credited with being the first sculptor to master this style. Naturally, as always in Greek athletics, the ''Discobolus'' is completely nude. His pose is said to be unnatural to a human, and today considered a rather inefficient way to throw the discus.&lt;ref&gt;An explanation for his inefficient discus throwing could be that the ancient Olympic sportsmen had a set rotation of three quarters before the discus was thrown. This rotation could well have been a deliberate handicap to make the sport more difficult.&lt;/ref&gt; Also there is very little emotion shown in the discus thrower's face, and "to a modern eye, it may seem that Myron's desire for perfection has made him suppress too rigorously the sense of strain in the individual muscles,"&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Clark observes. The other trademark of Myron embodied in this sculpture is how well the body is proportioned, the ''symmetria''.

The potential energy expressed in this sculpture's tightly wound pose, expressing the moment of stasis just before the release, is an example of the advancement of Classical sculpture from Archaic. The torso shows no muscular strain, however, even though the limbs are outflung.

== Reputation in the past ==
[[File:Discobolus red figure Louvre G292 full.jpg|thumb|right|The ''discobolus'' motif on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figured cup, ca. 490 BC, is static by comparison.]]
[[File:Discobolo-stabiae.JPG|thumb|Roman [[discus thrower]] from [[Stabiae]], Villa Arianna, 1st century AD]]
[[Myron]]'s ''Discobolus'' was long known from descriptions, such as the dialogue in [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s work ''[[Philopseudes]]'':

{{quote|"When you came into the hall," he said, "didn't you notice a totally gorgeous statue up there, by Demetrios the portraitist?" "Surely you don't mean the discus-thrower," said I, "the one bent over into the throwing-position, with his head turned back to the hand that holds the discus, and the opposite knee slightly flexed, like one who will spring up again after the throw?"

"Not that one," he said, "that's one of [[Myron]]'s works, that Diskobolos you speak of..."
|[[Lucian of Samosata]], ''Philopseudes''  c. 18&lt;ref&gt;The Lucian reference and [[Quintillian]], ii.13.xviii-x, are noted by {{Harvnb|Haskell|Penny|1981|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Discobolus'' and ''Discophorus''==
Prior to this statue's discovery the term ''Discobolus'' had been applied in the 17th and 18th centuries to a standing figure holding a discus, a ''[[Discophoros]]'', which [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]] identified as the ''Discobolus'' of [[Naukydes of Argos]], mentioned by [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny]] (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).

== ''Discobolus Palombara'' or ''Lancellotti'' ==
The ''Discobolus Palombara'', the first copy of this famous sculpture to have been discovered, was found in 1781. It is a 1st-century AD copy of [[Myron]]'s original bronze. Following its discovery at a Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara on the [[Esquiline Hill]], it was initially restored by Giuseppe Angelini; the Massimi installed it initially in their [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] and then at [[Palazzo Lancellotti]]. The Italian archaeologist [[Giovanni Battista Visconti]] identified the sculpture as a copy from the original of [[Myron]]. It was instantly famous, though the Massimo jealously guarded access to it (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).

In 1937 [[Adolf Hitler]] negotiated to buy it, and eventually succeeded in 1938, when [[Galeazzo Ciano]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, sold it to him for five million lire, over the protests of [[Giuseppe Bottai]], Minister of Education, and the scholarly community. It was shipped by rail to Munich and displayed in the [[Glyptothek]]; it was returned in 1948. It is now in the [[National Museum of Rome]], displayed at the [[Palazzo Massimo]].

== ''Townley Discobolus'' ==
[[File:Discobulus.jpg|thumb|The Townley ''Discobolus'' at the [[British Museum]], Roman copy with incorrectly restored head.]]

After the discovery of the ''Discobolus Palombara'' a second notable ''Discobolus'' was excavated, at [[Hadrian's Villa]] in 1790, and was purchased by the English antiquary and art dealer established in Rome, [[Thomas Jenkins (antiquary)|Thomas Jenkins]], at [[public auction]] in 1792. (Another example, also found at Tivoli at this date, was acquired by the [[Vatican Museums]].) The English connoisseur [[Charles Towneley|Charles Townley]] paid Jenkins £400 for the statue, which arrived at the semi-public gallery Townley commissioned in Park Street, London, in 1794. The head was wrongly restored, as [[Richard Payne Knight]] soon pointed out, but Townley was convinced his was the original and better copy.

It was bought for the [[British Museum]], with the rest of Townley's marbles, in July 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kitto, "The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737-1805" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase. [http://www.burnley.gov.uk/towneley/whatson/charles_towneley/Townley_Marbles_v1.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other copies ==
[[File:Discobolus in National Roman Museum Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.JPG|thumb|A Discobolus in the National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.]]
Other Roman copies in [[marble]] have been recovered, and torsos that were already known in the 17th century but that had been wrongly restored and completed, have since been identified as further repetitions after Myron's model. For one such example, in the early 18th century [[Pierre-Étienne Monnot]] restored a torso that is now recognized as an example of Myron's ''Discobolus'' as a ''Wounded Gladiator'' who supports himself on his arm as he sinks to the ground; the completed sculpture was donated before 1734 by [[Pope Clement XII]] to the [[Capitoline Museums]], where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Francis |last=Haskell |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Nicholas |last2=Penny |year=1981 |title=Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 |publisher=Yale University Press, pp. 200 &amp; 227. |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-02641-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another copy was discovered in 1906 in the ruins of a [[Roman villa]] at Tor Paterno in the former royal estate of Castel Porziano, now also conserved in the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark illustrated it in the 1956 edition of ''The Nude'', fig. 130, p.241, as "after [[Myron]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century plaster copies of the Discobolos could be found in many large academic collections, now mostly dispersed.

==Origins==
Von Hausswolff and Elggren formed the name out of their own names and define the country as being the [[border]]s of other countries. The decision to found the country and name themselves kings was in reaction to Sweden still having a monarchy.&lt;ref name=venice&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/09/arts/design/09bien.html|title=At Venice Biennale, Artists Plant Flag for Their State (of Mind)|work=New York Times|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=June 9, 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was announced in an advert in ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' newspaper. It was announced on May 27, 1992.&lt;ref name=exist&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ThnYCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT221|title=An Atlas of Countries That Don't Exist: A compendium of fifty unrecognized and largely unnoticed states|last=Middleton|first=Nick|date=November 5, 2015|publisher=Pan Macmillan|page=221|accessdate=June 22, 2016|isbn=9781447295297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Scandinavian artists have had micronations, such as [[Lars Vilks]]' [[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]].&lt;ref name=expressen/&gt;

Elgaland-Vargaland has a flag&lt;ref name=nowandthen/&gt; and national anthem, issues passports and stamps on request, and has had a number of "embassies" (art exhibitions).&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; Elggren often invokes "the image of a street-corner lunatic with a paper crown who declares himself King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lN85AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=elgaland&amp;dq=elgaland|title=Micro-bionic: Radical Electronic Music and Sound Art in the 21st Century|first1=Thomas|last1=Bey|first2=William|last2=Bailey|publisher=Creation Books|date=2009|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1994, they opened a "general consulate" at [[Thomas Nordanstad Gallery]] in New York and applied for membership of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Art Examiner|volume=25|issue=7-10|page=23|date=1998|publisher=New Art Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, on the tenth anniversary, a group of 10 travelled from Sweden to Estonia carrying only Elgaland-Vargaland passports - they were detained and their passports confiscated, and they were returned to Sweden the next day. They had planned to be turned away from each country in turn, indefinitely.&lt;ref name=exist/&gt; The same year, they released a musical album titled "The kingdoms of Elgaland-Vargaland, 1992-2002", published by Ash International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kudosrecords.co.uk/release/ash6.6/various-artists-the-kingdoms-of-elgaland-vargaland.html|title=Various Artists, The Kingdoms of Elgaland Vargaland|work=Ash International|date=July 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Elgaland-Vargaland attended a conference of micronations in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variant.org.uk/events/Market30/MM_Market.pdf|title=Between a Rock and a Hard Place – The Possibilities for Contemporary Art Institutions to Function as Critical Political Spaces|last=Muukkonen|first=Marita|date=2007|work=Variant.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the country had around 850 citizens&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; and by 2014 they claimed 980 citizens.&lt;ref name=nowandthen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artforum.com/diary/id=46029|title=Now and Then|last=Yablonsky|first=Linda|date=March 31, 2014|work=Art Forum|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 they had 20 ambassadors;&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; the embassy in Reykjavik opened in 1994 at the Nýlistasafninu (Museum of Fine Arts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/131237/|title=Konungsríkin Elgaland - Vargaland|work=Morgunbladid|date=March 26, 1994|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the embassy in Berlin was opened in 2006 at the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/veranstaltung/p_13838.php|title=The Opening of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Elgaland-Vargaland|work=HKW|date=October 21, 2006|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Moroccan embassy opened in 2014 before the [[Marrakech Biennale]].&lt;ref name=nowandthen/&gt; A "Consulate General" was held at [[Gallery 400]] in Chicago for two months in 2007-8 as part of the city's Festival of Maps.&lt;ref name=gallery400/&gt; They have a number of Ministers, mainly artists, including trumpeter Greg Kelley who is Minister of Fanfares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2011/11/16/a_curious_of_crowns_leif_elggren_at_lampo/|title=A Curious of Crowns: Leif Elggren at Lampo|work=Transmission|publisher=Gapers Block|date=November 16, 2011|last=Sienko|first=Chris|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims extend to other "interstitial territories" such as the transition from being asleep to wakefulness (the hypnogogic state),&lt;ref name=mass/&gt; and [[limbo]]&lt;ref name=exist/&gt; and they also regard all dead people as being citizens. In 2007, they declared at the [[Venice Biennale]] that they had annexed the [[Isola di San Michele]], an island cemetery.&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; This annexation project appeared at the Gallery Niklas Belenius in 2008.&lt;ref name=expressen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/kultur/konst/elgaland-vargaland--galleri-niklas-belenius/|title=Elgaland-Vargaland / Galleri Niklas Belenius|work=Expressen|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
KREV has been described as an art project that criticises the principles of the nation state and von Hausswolff and Elggren has, with the projects hierarchical diagram, clearly stated their disgust towards any kind of racism, fascism and oligarchy.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 70.107.13 Epa Mask.jpg|thumbnail|Epa Mask, collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
An '''Epa mask''' is a ceremonial mask worn by the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Nigeria]] during the Epa masquerade. Carvings representing priests, hunters, farmers, kings, and mothers are usually depicted on the masks. They are used to acknowledge important roles within the community, and to honor those who perform the roles, as well as ancestors who performed those roles in the past.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=70|url=http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171202/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html|archivedate=2011-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not being used during performances, Epa masks are kept in shrines where they are the focus of prayers and offerings from community elders.&lt;ref name=BMA /&gt;

==History==
Epa masks originated from the seventeen kingdoms which make up the [[Ekiti State|Ekiti region]] in the north-east of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] territory. Unlike other parts of Yorubaland, Ekiti has been subject to extensive foreign influences. The area received successive waves of immigration from [[Ife]] in the sixteenth century and from the [[Bini people|Bini]] in the seventeenth, as well as being the target of military raids from [[Ilorin]] and [[Ibadan]] in the middle or late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Forde&gt;{{cite book|last=Forde|first=D.|title=Yoruba Speaking People of Southwest Nigeria|year=1951|publisher=International African Institute|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the area was considered to have formed part of the [[Benin empire]].&lt;ref name=Akintoye&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akintoye|first=S.A.|title=The Benin Kingdom and the north-eastern districts of Yoruba country|journal=JAHSN|year=1969|volume=4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, its population has a complex mixed ethnic origin which has given rise to some unique traditions not previously found elsewhere in Yorubaland but which have since spread to the [[Iyagba]], [[Igbomina]], [[Oshun]], [[Owo]] and [[Ijesha]] regions. It is also not surprising to find that the warrior figures often surmounting Epa masks represent heroes who proved their mettle during this long period of instability.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Anthony|title=A Yoruba Epa Mask by Fasiku Alaye|journal=Journal of Museum Ethnography|year=1998|volume=10|pages=121–124|publisher=Museum Ethnographers Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Epa masks consist of a [[Janus]] faced helmet and an often elaborate figurative superstructure usually carved with a female or equestrian figure at its center. Surrounding the central figure are typically smaller figures, representing  traders, musicians, hunters and other personages central to Yoruba community life. Many Epa masks bear names like 'Mother with Children', 'Owner of Many Children', 'Children Cover Me' (like a protecting cloth), 'Children are Honorable to Have', 'Bringer of Children', 'Mother of Twins', 'Nursing Mother' and many other similar appellations, which occur in the songs that accompany the dancers.&lt;ref name=Ojo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ojo|first=J.R.|title=The symbolism and significance of Epa-type masquerade headpieces|journal=Man |series=New Series|year=1978|volume=13|issue=457470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet is always simply carved, often with two faces, and is reminiscent of a mortar or pot. Such similarities are made explicit in the term for the helmet, ''tkiko'' ('pot'), alluding to it as a container of spiritual power and otherworldly force, [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. The eyes of one face are usually carved open, looking out to the world of the living, while those on the other are sealed, contemplating the realm of the divine and the ancestors. Much [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ceremonial is concerned with the control and focusing of this divine force for the benefit of the community. The control and focusing of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] is a central theme throughout the different episodes that make up the Epa festival as well as apparently constituting a theme in other ceremonies in which Epa masks are used. The equestrian figures from episodes from the region's turbulent history incorporate representations of the channeling of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] to safeguard the conquering hero. Maternity figures invoke [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] for increasing procreative abilities and fertility, while references to medicine also express the dependence of personal well-being on the judicial channeling of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Perhaps, then, the iconographic clue to the meaning of Epa masks is not to be found in their elaborate superstructures, but in the crude pot helmet itself as a manifestation of the efficacy of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] for communal and personal well-being.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;

==Ritual Context==
In north-west [[Yorubaland]] the Epa masks are kept by the head of a lineage or a town chief on behalf of the lineage or community. When in use they are choreographed as emerging from the bush, where they return once 
the festival is completed. Offerings may be made to a mask before it is used or during the ceremony. According to Robert Thompson, 'the Epa cult stresses the transformation of young men into stalwart specimens 
able to bear pain and shoulder heavy weight'.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African Art in Motion|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles and Berkeley|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Arowolo of lloro distinguished between the type of energy belonging to the cult of [[Elefon]], concerned with ancestral spirits, and the cult of Epa, connected with the dignified, slow and patient masquerades of ancient men and culture heroes.&lt;ref name=Heyden&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heyden|first=M.V.|title=The Epa mask and ceremony|journal=African Arts X|year=1977|volume=2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] Yoruba share their principal deities with Yoruba from elsewhere, they also have many deities and masquerades  peculiar to themselves, leading other fieldworkers to note that the distinction is less clear than Thompson suggested.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; In north-eastern Yorubaland, Epa and other masks are used in annual ceremonies, held in February or March in some places or as late as September in others to promote the fertility and well-being of the community.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; They also appear in Elefon festivals performed to celebrate the return of the warriors, to honor [[Ogoun|Ogun]], the god of war and iron and to mark the growth of new crops. Elsewhere such masks were used in post-burial rites relating to titled men. In one fairly consistent episode in the festival the masquerader, supporting a mask which can often weigh 50&amp;nbsp;lbs or more, attempts to jump off a mound to augur the quality of the new year. A fall or loss of balance is read as a bad omen which may herald coming misfortune.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;

==Epa Masquerade==
Early writers interpreted Epa ceremonies as entirely focused on fertility.&lt;ref name="Fagg &amp; Eliosofson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagg|first=W. &amp; E. Eliosofson|title=The Sculpture of Africa|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp;  Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have found the ceremonies to be equally concerned with warriors and the medicine God [[Osanyin]], relating them to both physical and spiritual security.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=K|title=Yoruba Religious Carving: Pagan and Christian Sculpture in Nigeria and Dahomey|year=1967|publisher=: Geoffrev Chapma|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ojo,&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; following Carroll,&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt; has proposed that at one level the ceremonies incorporate the re-enactment of historical events. In a ceremony recorded by Heyden in [[Ekiti State|lloro, Ekiti]], masks surmounted by female figures were identified as the wives of the warrior [[Okotorojo]], represented by an animal mask resembling a goat or antelope. Okotorojo, the principal figure in the festival, was chained to another man described as either having the duty to restrain the wild powers of the warrior or, paradoxically, as the representative of the power ([[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]) of [[Eleda]], who always remains behind the warrior to render him invincible in battle.&lt;ref name=Heyden /&gt;

==Photography career==
Fan Ho was born in [[Shanghai]] in 1931, and emigrated with his family to [[Hong Kong]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=SCMP-151117&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1879716/street-life-hong-kong-1950s-seen-through-lens |title=Street Life: Hong Kong in the 1950s as seen through the lens of photographer Fan Ho |author= |date=17 November 2015 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of war in 1941, Ho's parents were stranded in Macau for several years and Ho was left in the care of a family servant.&lt;ref name=VisualDialogues&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sothebys.com/pdf/2017/HK0758/docs/HK0758.pdf |title=Visual Dialogues: Hong Kong through the lens of Fan Ho |author1=Greene, Sarah |author2=Yan, Jasmine |author3= |date=2017 |publisher=Sotheby's |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho began photographing at a very young age with a [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]] which his father had left at home, and later with a [[Rolleiflex]] [[twin-lens reflex camera]] his father gave him at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKM-1211 /&gt; Largely self-taught, his photos display a fascination with urban life, explored alleys, slums, markets and streets.

Ho would use the same Rolleiflex K4A throughout his career.&lt;ref name=PR-201706&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.artsy.net/show/blue-lotus-gallery-fan-ho-visual-dialogues-hong-kong-through-the-lens-of-fan-ho |title=Fan Ho: Visual Dialogues/Hong Kong through the lens of Fan Ho |author= |date=June 2017 |publisher=Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt;

{{quote |text=... I've always believed that any work of art should stem from genuine feelings and understandings ... I didn't work with any sense of purpose. As an artist, I was only looking to express myself. I did it to share my feelings with the audience. I need to be touched emotionally to come up with meaningful works. When the work resonates with the audience, it's a satisfaction that money can't buy. My purpose is simple: I try not to waste my audience's time. [''Laughs''] |author=Ho Fan |source=2014 interview with Edmund Lee&lt;ref name=SCMP-141210 /&gt;}}

Upon seeing Ho's work for the first time in 2006, gallery owner [[Laurence Miller]] commented that "[they] felt like direct descendants of the [[Bauhaus]], yet they were made in Hong Kong. They were abstract and humanistic at the same time."&lt;ref name=studiointernational/&gt;

Ho was a Fellow of the [[Photographic Society of America]], the [[Royal Photographic Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in England, and an Honorary Member of the Photographic Societies of Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluelotus-gallery.com/ho-fan-1/ |title=Ho Fan (1931-2016) |author=Greene, Sarah |date= |publisher=Blue Lotus Gallery |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho was named one of the "Top Ten Photographers of the World" by the Photographic Society of America between 1958 and 1965.&lt;ref name=SCMP-151117 /&gt;

[[File:Approaching Shadow.jpg|thumb|upright|"Approaching Shadow" by Ho, 1954]]
"Approaching Shadow" ({{zh|t=陰影}}) was one of Ho's most famous works. He asked a cousin to pose by a wall at [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|Queen's College]] in [[Causeway Bay]] and added a diagonal shadow in the darkroom to symbolize that "her youth will fade away" since "everyone has the same destiny".&lt;ref name=HKM-1211&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/hk-magazine/article/2034956/ho-fan-memory-hong-kongs-iconic-photographer |title=Ho Fan: In Memory of Hong Kong's Iconic Photographer |author=Ho, Fan |date=November 2012 |magazine=HK Magazine |publisher=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A print of "Approaching Shadow" sold for a record {{HK$|375,000}} in 2015.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622 /&gt;

==Film career==
Ho was an accomplished and acclaimed{{cn|date=March 2017}} Hong Kong film director and actor.

He joined [[Shaw Brothers]] in 1961 to develop his career in cinema. He started as a [[continuity editing|continuity assistant]] in the movie ''The Swallow'' (1961)&lt;ref name=HKFDG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hkfilmdirectors.com/en/director/ho-fan |title=何藩 / HO Fan |author= |date=2017 |publisher=Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild |website=The Ultimate Guide to HK Film Directors |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved on to act in several movies for Shaw. Ho won praise for his performance as the Monk, Tripitaka, in the lavish Shaw Brothers adaption of [[List of media adaptations of Journey to the West#Films|''Journey to the West'' four-picture cycle of films]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} Ho became disillusioned with Shaw's revenue-driven formula, and sought creative relief in photography and in other studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/2/9/15/n215710.htm |title=華藝攝影學會三十五週年華誕 |trans-title=The 30th Anniversary of The Chinatown Photographic Society |author=卞克 |date=15 September 2002 |newspaper=Epoch Times |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s he also produced a pioneering{{cn|date=July 2017}} series of independent short films, the first of which, ''Big City Little Man'' (大都市 小人物; 1963, 30 min), won the "Honor Award Certificate" from the Japan International Film Festival in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/en_US/web/hkfa/publications_souvenirs/pub/topicalvolumes/topicalvolumes_detail02.html |title=i-Generations: Independent, experimental and alternative creations from the 60s to now |editor=Fung, May |publisher=[[Hong Kong Film Archive]] |date=2001 |isbn=962-8050-13-3 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=People tell me it seems my photographic works have stories, have some drama. That’s why, later on, I became a film director. Both use images to tell their story, to express the emotions of the author. Photography and filmmaking are like sisters. One is still and one is moving—that is the only difference. |author=Ho Fan |source=2012 ''HK Magazine'' article&lt;ref name=HKM-1211 /&gt;}}

Ho left Shaw Brothers in 1969 to develop his career as a director, making over 20 films with various studios in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He has had three films in the "Official Selection" of the [[Cannes Film Festival|International Film Festivals of Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]] and [[San Francisco International Film Festival|San Francisco]]; and five of his films have been selected in the "Permanent Collection" of the National Film Archives of Taiwan and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=HKFDG /&gt; As well as his independent film work he is acclaimed for pioneering the erotic field ([[Hong Kong motion picture rating system|Category III films]]) in cinema, with such cult{{cn|date=July 2017}} films as ''Adventure in Denmark'' (1973), ''The Girl with the Long Hair'' (1975) and the highly successful ''Temptation Summary'' (1990).

According to Mark Pinsukanjana, director of Modernbook Gallery in San Francisco, CA, his debut feature, ''Lost'' (1969), was Ho's favourite. As Pinsukanjana says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''Lost'', one will see the chaotic life of one man in Hong Kong. The film follows him and finds the beauty that surrounds him; he is lost because he never saw it. I think that one can say that this is similar to Fan Ho's photographs in the sense that Hong Kong is crowded, busy and chaotic to many, but for Fan Ho, he was able to convert [what he found] and find beauty."&lt;ref name=studiointernational&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/stillness-in-motion-the-photographs-of-fan-ho/ |title=Stillness in Motion: The Photographs of Fan Ho |author=Di Marzo, Cindi |publisher=Studio-international.co.uk |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also served on the jury of the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]] Festival and [[Hong Kong Film Award]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Post-retirement career==
[[File:Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery Fan Ho Exhibition view 2017.jpg|200px|thumb|Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery Fan Ho Exhibition in 2017]]
Ho's wife and children emigrated to [[San Jose, California]] in 1979 to pursue a university education&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt; and he followed in 1995 after retiring from cinema.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/1979279/ho-fan-celebrated-1950s-hong-kong-street-photographer-dies |title=Ho Fan, celebrated 1950s Hong Kong street photographer, dies in California |author=Cheung, Rachel |date=22 June 2016 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restless in retirement, Ho's health began to decline until his family suggested that he pursue photography again. Rather than using modern equipment and taking photographs locally in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Ho went through his old negatives from Hong Kong and began showing his portfolio to local galleries.&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt;

He exhibited slides of his photographs, some of which were in the permanent collection at [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|SFMOMA]], at the 1998 New Asian Cinema Festival, which was screening his 1988 film ''Carnal Desire'' at the 4 Star Theater in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Carnal-Desire-spiritual-journeys-3089238.php |title="Carnal Desire," spiritual journeys |author=Johnson, G.

Modernbook went on to stage his vintage work at photoLA in January 2006, and upon seeing his photographs of Hong Kong, fellow gallery owner Laurence Miller was moved to acquire 26 prints and put on a solo exhibit for Ho in New York City later that year.&lt;ref name=studiointernational /&gt; Ho would go on to publish a new monograph, ''Hong Kong Yesterday'' in 2006 after receiving international attention for this early work.&lt;ref name=studiointernational /&gt; By compositing old negatives, Ho continued to produce new prints of scenes that have now vanished from modern Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=SCMP-140810 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN-131030 /&gt; Many of the resulting composited prints were published for the first time in his final monograph ''A Hong Kong Memoir'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=SCMP-141210&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1656431/inquisition-ho-fan-photographer |title=Ho Fan, Hong Kong photographer, on retrieving lost memories |interviewer=Edmund Lee |subject=Ho Fan |date=10 December 2014 |publisher=South China Morning Post |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following exhibits of the same title at Modernbook in summer 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/fan-hos-hong-kong-snapshots-bear-playful-theatricality/Content?oid=2178470 |title=Fan Ho's Hong Kong snapshots bear playful theatricality |author=Archer, Larissa |date=21 July 2011 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from December 2014 to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/fan-ho-photos-bring-mid-century-hong-kong-to-life/Content?oid=2915055 |title=Fan Ho photos bring mid-century Hong Kong to life |author=Katz, Anita |date=25 December 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of Hong Kong'' 《舊香港人的舊》 contains 153 new street photographs which were selected from 500 negatives chosen by Ho before he died in 2016. After his death, the surviving family members spent about a year completing the project, together with support from Sarah Greene (Blue Lotus Consultancy) and WE Press (香港人出版). 20 quotable excerpts from Ho's earliest book, ''Thoughts on Street Photography'' 《街頭攝影叢談》, were included. These 153 photographs provide not only glimpses of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s but also recall the indomitable spirit of the people at the time&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2098441/how-fan-ho-hong-kongs-poet-camera-found-his|title=How Fan Ho, Hong Kong's poet with a camera, found his calling - in his own words|last=Heaver|first=Stuart|date=June 20, 2017|work=Post Magazine, South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zolimacitymag.com/hong-kong-revisited-through-the-eyes-of-the-late-street-photographer-fan-ho/|title=Hong Kong Revisited Through the Eyes of the Late Street Photographer Fan Ho|last=Karacs|first=Sarah|date=June 13, 2017|work=Zolima Citymag|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of realistic street photographs were never highly recognized during 1950s and 1960s, despite being Ho's favorites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/hongkong/lifestyle/never-seen-snaps-old-hong-kong-legendary-photographer-fan-ho-go-show/|title=Never-seen-before snaps of 'old Hong Kong' from legendary photographer Fan Ho to go on show|last=Hong Kong|first=Coconuts|date=|website=Coconuts Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as quoted in Ho’s reply to Sarah Greene during one of her visits to Ho in early 2016.

'''Film censorship''' is carried out by various countries to differing degrees, sometimes as a result of powerful or relentless lobbying by organizations or individuals. Films that are banned in a particular country change over time.

==Rating systems==
A [[motion picture rating system]] is designated to classify films with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of obscene content. A particular issued rating can be called a certification, classification, certificate.

==By country==
{{See also|List of banned films}}

===Australia===

Australia's [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB), formerly known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification  (OFLC), uses the Commonwealth Classification Act 1995 as a guide for the majority of the censorship within the country; however, each state and territory is free to make additional legislation (see [[Censorship in Australia]]). Australia is regarded by many to be the most restrictive on film ratings of all Western democratic countries, considering its history and prolific "refusal of classification" (tantamount to banning in other countries) to certain films, although restrictions have eased over the years.

In practice, films still get a short cinematic run before they are reviewed and prevented from being shown at cinemas or released on DVD. This is not a comprehensive list; many films that have been previously banned are not mentioned here (however, some have since been released uncut on DVD). Also not included are the numerous pornographic films deemed too excessive to release under an X18+ category, which are refused classification by the ACB.

===Brazil===
;During dictatorship (1964–1988)
During the dictatorship in Brazil, that last from 1964 to 1988, several films were banned under the Federal Law from Brazil 5536 from 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:1968-11-21;5536 |title=Lei nº 5.536, de 21 de Novembro de 1968 - 5536/68 :: Legislação::Lei 5536/1968 (Federal - Brasil) :: |publisher=Lexml.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During several years a project was being developed to find and publish every document on censorship in films during the dictatorship.
The project "Memory of Censorship in Brazilian Cinema" released in 2005 six thousand documents about 175 banned films during the dictatorship. And, finally, in 2007 they released documents for the last 269 films banned at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriacinebr.com.br/projeto.asp |title=:.

;After democratization (1988–)
* 1993: ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'':

"On August 20, 2009, the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported that Rede Record bought the broadcasting rights of the documentary from Ellis for less than US$ 20,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diversao.terra.com.br/tv/noticias/0,,OI3934538-EI12993,00.html |title=Documentário vira arma de Record contra Globo - Terra Brasil |publisher=Diversao.terra.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/portal/ultimas_noticias/2009/08/20/imprensa30235.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826185949/http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/portal/ultimas_noticias/2009/08/20/imprensa30235.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-26 |title=Record compra direitos de documentário sobre a Rede Globo - Portal IMPRENSA |publisher=Portalimprensa.uol.com.br |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1976: ''Di Cavalcanti'':

This film (short) about Di Cavalcanti was banned due a lawsuit open by Di Cavalcanti daughter, Elizabeth, in 1979. The film documented the wake and funeral of the Brazilian painter Di Cavalcanti. Since 1979 it can not be shown, at the request of his daughter Elizabeth through preliminary injunction granted by Justice, confirmed in 1983, for sentimental reasons tied with religious ideas. In 1985, the lawyer Felipe Falcon moved an action to reform the judgment, by proposing the dispossession of the film by the state on cultural grounds, to the detriment of the heirs of Di and Glauber. Yet with no solution in sight, Di Glauber must stay contained in a sealed box. 2004: In spite of everything, João Rocha ( director of Thuth Profane),nephew of the Glauber Rocha, has placed a copy on video on providers outside of Brazil: the internet users can make free downloads of the movie, proving that censor the cinema in digital age is useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pron.com.br/editoria/almanaque/news/58427/?noticia=GLAUBER+SEM+CENSURA |title=Glauber sem censura - Paraná-Online - Paranaense como você |publisher=Pron.com.br |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://correiodobrasil.com.br/di-sem-censura/54075/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708184915/http://correiodobrasil.com.br/di-sem-censura/54075/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meucinediario.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/censored-films-in-brazil-1908-1988-2/ |title=CENSORED FILMS IN BRAZIL, 1908-1988 &amp;#124; DIÁRIO CINEMATOGRÁFICO |publisher=Meucinediario.wordpress.com |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2011: ''[[A Serbian Film]]'':

''A Serbian Film'' had its release in Brazil liberated on August 5, 2011. The exception is Rio de Janeiro estate, where the film was forbidden due a lawsuit filed by the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] political party, who claim that the pedophilia scenes infringe the part of the Brazilian Constitution that protects children (Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente). The case was overturned in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/a-serbian-film-liberado-em-todo-brasil-menos-no-rio-de-janeiro-2706621|title='A Serbian Film' é liberado em todo Brasil, menos no Rio de Janeiro|date=5 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.estadao.com.br/flavia-guerra/quase-um-ano-depois-a-serbian-film-e-liberado-em-todo-o-brasil/|title=Quase um ano depois, A Serbian Film é liberado em todo o Brasil|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Film censorship in Canada}}
At present, only films containing prohibited material (such as child pornography) or under court order (such as libel or copyright infringement) are banned in Canadian provinces. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===China===
{{main|Film censorship in China|Hong Kong motion picture rating system}}
Republic of China (Taiwan) has attempted age-based rating system as early as November 1948, become a democracy since the 1980s, and technically dropped censorship requirement in its film law in 2015, despite it still may not issue the Restricted rating occasionally, if the film elicits feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18. In Mainland China, film censorship, often on political grounds, is rampant. Films in Mainland China are currently reviewed by the [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television]] (SAPPRFT) (Chinese: 国家新闻出版广电总局) which dictates whether, when, and how a movie gets released.

===India===
{{Main article|Film censorship in India}}In India, films are censored by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a statutory [[censorship]] and [[Motion picture content rating system|classification]] body       under the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]], [[Government of India]]. Films should be certified by the board to publicly exhibit it in India, including films shown in television. CBFC is considered to be one of the most powerful censor boards in the world due to its strict ways of functioning.

===Iran===

{{main|Film censorship in Iran}}
All films depicting anything deemed contrary to Islamic morals are banned outright in Iran.

===Ireland===
{{main|Film censorship in the Republic of Ireland}}
Due to the small size of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], films banned by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) were rarely even submitted for release in Ireland, due to the high costs of promotion and distribution for such a small audience. Similarly, BBFC cuts are often left in DVD releases, due to the difficulties in separating the two film supplies.

This changed in 2000; many of these films have since been unbanned and rated anywhere from PG to 18. During the review process it was decided that no more films would be banned for either theatre or video release, but some bans are still in place.
Banned films can still be viewed at private members' clubs with 18+ age limits.

===Israel===
All [[Germany|German]] films were banned from 1956 until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UyIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zN4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=971,1381626&amp;dq=israel+bans+film&amp;hl=en Israel lifts total ban on German films.] ''Canadian Jewish Chronicle Review.'' 14 April 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Film censorship in Malaysia}}

===South Africa===
During the Apartheid regime, films depicting interracial couples were banned and/or censored for content - the James Bond films ''Live and Let Die'' and ''A View To A Kill'' had love scenes which were censored by the South African government.{{citation needed |date=November 2013}}

===South Korea===
{{Main article |Film censorship in South Korea}}

According to the Internet Movie Database, there are no currently-banned films in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of banned films in South Korea|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?certificates=kr:(banned)|accessdate=2010-12-17|publisher=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against the Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia are disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also be an issue. Korea has a five level rating systems; G, PG-12, PG-15, PG-18 and Restricted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Film censorship in the United Kingdom}}
The infamous [[video nasty]] list was created in 1982 to protect against obscenity. Films on this list were banned and distributors of said films were liable to be prosecuted (some of the films were banned before the list was made). This list banned 74 films at one point in the mid-1980s; the list was eventually trimmed down, and only 39 films were successfully prosecuted. Most of the films (even of the 39 successfully prosecuted) have now been approved by the [[BBFC]], cut or uncut (see [[Video Recordings Act 1984]]).

===United States===
{{Main article|Film censorship in the United States}}
The United States has no federal agency charged with either permitting or restricting the exhibition of motion pictures. Most instances of films being banned are via ordinances or proclamations by city or state governments.&lt;ref&gt;Wittern-Keller, Laura. Freedom of the Screen: Legal Challenges to State Film Censorship. University Press of Kentucky, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are instances of films being judicially found to be of an obscene nature and subject to specific laws against such material (i.e., [[child pornography]]).  Such findings are usually only legally binding in the jurisdiction of the court making such a ruling.

The established [[Cinema of the United States|film industry in the United States]] began a form of self-censorship in the late 1920s called the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] to forestall any possible formation of a federal censoring agency. In 1968, the Production Code was superseded by the [[MPAA film rating system]].

====Soviet Union====
In Soviet Union most foreign films never had been shown thus avoiding the need for banning.

== Brief History ==
[[File:Private Screening Room.jpg|alt=Where films would be screened before public viewing|thumb|Private Screening Room]]
Film censorship, the control of the content and presentation of a film, has been a part of the film industry almost as long as it has been around.&lt;ref&gt;Helicon (2018). "The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide". ''Censorship, Film''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Britain established film censorship in 1912 and the United Stated followed a decade later. Other early efforts of censoring the film industry include the Hays Code of 1922 and the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, Dawn (2001).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5940">In [[art criticism]] of the 1960s and 1970s, '''flatness''' described the smoothness and absence of curvature or surface detail of a two-dimensional work of art.  Critic [[Clement Greenberg]] believed that flatness, or two-dimensional, was an essential and desirable quality in [[painting]], a criterion which implies rejection of [[painterliness]] and [[impasto]].  The valorization of flatness led to a number of art movements, including [[minimalism]] and [[post-painterly abstractionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artlex.com/ArtLex/Fi.html Art-Lex], "Flat"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wolfe]], ''The Painted Word'' (Bantam, 1975: {{ISBN|0-553-38065-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]] of the arts happened during the second half of the 19th century and extended into most of the 20th. This period of art is identified by art forms consisting of an image on a flat two-dimensional surface. This art evolution began in the 1860s and culminated 50 years later. By this time almost all three-dimensional works had been eliminated. This new approach to painting was to create a visual appearance of realism. Looking at a surface with only two-dimensions our perception of depth is an illusion. The reduction of depth in painting was the consequence of investigation. This new essence of self-analysis attempted to establish an experience or effect from the viewer of the painting.&lt;ref&gt; Stephen Croddy. “Explaining Modernism,” n.d. http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Aest/AestCrod.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''flatness''' can be used to describe much of the popular American art work of the 1950s and 1960s. The art of this period had a basic yet colorful design that held a degree of two dimensional form. Thus the term '''flatness''' is used to describe this medium. The ground work idea for [[Minimalism]] began in Russia in 1913 when [[Kazimir Malevich]] placed a black square on a white background claiming that: “Art no longer cares to serve the state and religion it no longer wishes to illustrate the history of manners, it wants to have nothing further to do with the object as such, and believes that it can exist in and for itself without things.”&lt;ref&gt; Nikos Stangos. Concepts of Modern Art. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first [[Minimalism]] artworks was created in 1964 by [[Dan Flavin]]. He produced a neon sculpture titled ''Monument for V. Tatlin''. This work was a simplistic assembly of neon tubes that were not carved or constructed in any way. The idea was that they were not supposed to symbolize anything but to just merely exist. The Minimalist approach to art was to conceive by the mind before execution. Traditional modes of art composition were looked away from in favor of improvisation, spontaneity and automatism. This new expressionist style consisted of improvised pattern making where every stroke of the brush was viewed as expression and subjective freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Nikos Stangos. Concepts of Modern Art. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept inspired a whole new art form called [[Pop Art]]. It retained the color scheme and simplicity of [[Minimalism]], but it borrowed images from pop culture to become relatable. The works now in question held a meaning for the viewer with familiar imagery but it still retained the [[avant-garde]] approach of [[Minimalism]]. [[Pop Art]] is a well-recognized movement for 1960s culture. This type of art was very free form fashionable and rebellious. It was wild and colorful but many works retained the idea of two dimensional '''flatness'''.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Sandler. American Art Of The 1960s. Harper and Row, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop Art]] fell out of fashion and a new movement came into being. [[Op Art]] or Optic Art was now the latest trend in home décor and fashion. This form of modern art shares a strong relationship with the culture thought and design of the 1960s. This new art form focused on non-objective painting that focused on design, color, form, and line. These paintings where hand drawn or created with a mechanical aid. They featured a flat looking two dimensional design that could appear to pop out in an almost three dimensional form. Some pieces look as if they are moving due to shape and line placement creating a trick of the eye. This form of art was created to test the limits of the conscious perception of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt; Houston, Joe. Optic Nerve Perceptual Art Of The 1960s. London, New York: Merrell Publishers Limited, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright colors were no longer favored as much of [[Op Art]] is black and white with little use of color. The designs presented migrated back to the Minimalist idea of art simply existing and not representing an ideal. A well noted artist of this style is [[Bridget Riley]] who shaped the contemporary art scene of the early 50s and 70s. Her works are designed to pull the eye in such a way to stretch and disorder the perceptual sense. She is considered a ground breaking artist in the realm of modern art. Her work mainly consists of detailed line and circle patterns to create an optical challenge for the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Robertson. Bridget Riley Paintings and Drawings 1951-1971. The Hayward Gallery, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley composes her art with the thought in mind; that we all have a narrow view on how we see things and our vision is rarely stretched to new abilities. Her work confronts the observer with new imaginative sensations, and the overall purpose of the artist’s disappears and is replaced with what the viewer conceives. This form of art has no clear outlined theme therefore it allows total freedom for one to compose their imagination. Riley’s work ignores object and instead focuses on movement to create a seemingly endless pattern. Riley’s art appeared in the fashion of that era. Similar patterns still remain popular in clothing today.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Robertson. Bridget Riley Paintings and Drawings 1951-1971. The Hayward Gallery, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grendel's mother''' ({{lang-ang|Grendles mōðor}}) is one of three [[antagonist]]s in the anonymous [[Old English literature|Old English poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 700–1000 AD). The other antagonists are [[Grendel]] and the [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], all aligned in opposition to the hero [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]. She is introduced in lines 1258b to 1259a as: "Grendles modor/ides, aglæcwif".

Grendel's mother, who is never given a name in the text, is the subject of ongoing controversy among [[medieval]] [[scholars]]. This is due to the ambiguity of a few [[Old English language|words in Old English]] which appear in the original [[Nowell Codex|''Beowulf'' manuscript]]. While there is consensus over the word "modor" (mother), the phrase "ides, aglæcwif" is the subject of scholarly debate.

==Story==
{{main|Beowulf}}
The poem, ''[[Beowulf]],'' is contained in the [[Nowell Codex]]. As noted in lines 106–114 and lines 1260–1267 of ''Beowulf,'' monsters (which include Grendel's mother and [[Grendel]]) are descendants of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. After Grendel is killed, Grendel's mother attacks [[Heorot]] in revenge. Beowulf then ventures into her cave under a lake, and engages in fierce combat with Grendel's mother. She nearly kills him until he sees an ancient sword, which he kills her with, and beheads the dead Grendel. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the "ninth hour" (l. 1600, "nōn", about 3&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref&gt;Jack, George. ''Beowulf: A Student Edition,'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in and structure of the poem==
[[Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|150 px|right|The first page of the ''[[Beowulf]]'' manuscript.]]
Some scholars have argued that the female characters in ''Beowulf'' fulfill certain established roles such as ''hostess'' ([[Wealhþeow]] and [[Hygd]]) and [[peace-weaver]] ([[Freawaru]] and [[Hildeburh]]). Grendel's mother and [[Modthryth]] (before her marriage to [[Offa of Angel|Offa]]), who challenge these roles, represent "monster-women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= Dorothy | last=Porter| url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/5/porter1.html| title=The Social Centrality of Women in ''Beowulf'': A New Context| journal=The Heroic Age: A Journal of Early Medieval Northwestern Europe |issue=5| date=Summer–Autumn 2001| accessdate=2006-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Chance argues in "The Structural Unity of ''Beowulf'': The Problem of Grendel's Mother"&lt;ref name="Chance"&gt;Nitzsche, Jane Chance (1980). "The Structural Unity of ''Beowulf'': The Problem of Grendel's Mother." ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'' '''22'''(3): 287–303. {{JSTOR|40754612}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there are two standard interpretations of the poem: one view which suggests a two-part structure (i.e., the poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with [[Grendel]] and with the dragon) and the other, a three-part structure (this interpretation argues that Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother is structurally separate from his battle with Grendel). Chance stated that, "this view of the structure as two-part has generally prevailed since its inception in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' in ''Proceedings of the British Academy 22'' (1936)."&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; In contrast, she argued that the three-part structure has become "increasingly popular".&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; She later developed this argument in ''Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Nitzsche, Jane Chance. ''Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.'' Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates on Grendel's mother==
There is ongoing debate among medieval scholars concerning the ambiguity of a few [[Old English language|words in Old English]] (related to Grendel's mother) which appear in the original ''[[Nowell Codex|Beowulf manuscript]]''. Because these terms are ambiguous, scholars disagree over aspects of her nature and appearance. Indeed, because her exact appearance is never directly described in [[Old English]] by the original ''Beowulf'' poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely her descent from the biblical [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] (who was the first murderer, according to the [[Abrahamic religion]]s).  For some scholars, this descent links her and Grendel to the monsters and giants of the ''[[Cain tradition]],''&lt;ref&gt;[[David Williams (medievalist)|Williams, David]]. ''Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as Kevin Kiernan in ''Grendel's Heroic Mother''&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that there is "plenty of evidence for defending Grendel's mother as a heroic figure" &lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 31.&lt;/ref&gt; as she "accepted and adhered to the heroic ethic of the blood-feud, the main difference between Grendel's feckless feud with the noise at Heorot and his mother's purposeful one exacting retribution for the death of her son. In heroic terms, her vengeance for the death of her kinsman Grendel."&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of consensus has led to the production of a few seminal texts by scholars over the past few decades. One important focus of these articles and books concerns the numerous, and at times opposing, translations of especially the [[Old English]] compound "ides aglæcwif" (1259a).

===Monster or demon===
Until the late 1970s, all scholarship on Grendel's mother and translations of the phrase "aglæc-wif" were influenced by the edition of noted ''Beowulf'' scholar [[Frederick Klaeber]]. His edition, ''Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg'', has been considered a standard in ''Beowulf'' scholarship since its first publication in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_language_quarterly/v060/60.2bloomfield.pdf Bloomfield, Josephine. Benevolent Authoritarianism in Klaeber's Beowulf: An Editorial Translation of Kingship. "Modern Language Quarterly 60:2, June 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klaeber's glossary, "aglæc-wif" translates as: "wretch, or monster of a woman". Klaeber's glossary also defines "aglæca/æglæca" as "monster, demon, fiend" when referring to [[Grendel]] or Grendel's mother and as "warrior, hero" when referring to the character [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Klaeber|Klaeber, Frederick]]. ''Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg''. Third ed. Boston: Heath, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaeber has influenced many translations of ''Beowulf.'' Notable interpretations of  "aglæc-wif" which follow Klaeber include "monstrous hell bride" (Heaney),&lt;ref name="Beowulf: A New Verse Translation"&gt;[[Seamus Heaney|Heaney, Seamus]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0393320979&amp;id=ynD9o-LfTDMC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=4rtZ-a90PG&amp;dq=Beowulf:+A+New+Verse+Translation&amp;sig=TANJDD5siOW13PupnLi4qiw6SYk Beowulf: A New Verse Translation]''. New York: Norton, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; "monster-woman" (Chickering) &lt;ref&gt;Chickering, Howell D. ''Beowulf''. Garden City: Anchor, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; "woman, monster-wife" (Donaldson),&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, E. Talbot, and Nicholas Howe. ''Beowulf : A Prose Translation : Backgrounds and Contexts, Criticism''. 2nd ed. New York: Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ugly troll-lady" (Trask) &lt;ref&gt;Trask, Richard M. ''Beowulf and Judith : Two Heroes''. Lanham: UP of America, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and "monstrous hag" (Kennedy).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Charles W., and tr. ''Beowulf, the Oldest English Epic''. New York: Oxford UP, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doreen M.E. Gillam's 1961 essay, "The Use of the Term 'Æglæca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592," explores Klaeber's dual use of the term "aglæca/æglæca" for the heroes [[Sigmund|Sigemund]] and Beowulf as well as for Grendel and Grendel's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961): 145–69.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that "aglæca/æglæca" is used in works besides ''Beowulf'' to reference both "devils and human beings". She further argues that this term is used to imply "supernatural," "unnatural" or even "inhuman" characteristics, as well as hostility towards other creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; Gillam suggests: "Beowulf, the champion of men against monsters, is almost inhuman himself. [Aglæca/æglæca] epitomises, in one word, the altogether exceptional nature of the dragon fight. Beowulf, the champion of good, the 'monster' amongst men, challenges the traditional incarnation of evil, the Dragon: æglæca meets æglæcan."&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961):169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ides/dis (lady)===
[[Image:ValkyrieOnHorse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sculpture of a valkyrie on a horse by [[Stephan Sinding]] (1908)]]
[[Image:Gefion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Gefion Fountain]] in Copenhagen, Denmark by Anders Bundgård, 1908.]]
[[Image:Freya by Penrose.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Freyja, depicted in a painting by J. Penrose.]]

The [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[Idis (Germanic)|ides]]'', [[Old High German]] ''itis'' and Old Norse ''[[dís]]'' are cognates that all mean "lady,"&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfbf/0272.html Dis]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1907).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''idisi'' appears as the name of the [[Valkyrie]]s in the only surviving pagan source in [[Old High German]], the ''[[Merseburg Incantations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, Thomas. ''An Anthology of German Literature'', D. C. Heath &amp; co. ASIN: B0008BTK3E,B00089RS3K.  P5.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, in [[Norse mythology]], the ''[[Dísir]]'' ('ladies') are fate goddesses who can be both benevolent and antagonistic towards mortal people.

Consequently, many have pointed out that ''dís'' is probably the original term for the [[valkyrie]]s (lit. "choosers of the slain"), which in turn would be a [[kenning]] for ''dís''.&lt;ref&gt;'''Including:''' Ström, Folke (1954) ''Diser, nornor, valkyrjor: Fruktberhetskult och sakralt kungadöme i Norden''; Näsström, and Britt-Mari (1995) ''Freyja: The Great Goddess of the North''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few scholars have drawn from the work of [[Eric Stanley]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Stanley|Stanley, Eric]]. "[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/8/339 Did Beowulf Commit 'Feaxfeng' against Grendel's Mother]" ''Notes and Queries'' 23 (1976): 339–40. {{doi|10.1093/nq/23-8-339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Eric. "Two Old English Poetic Phrases Insufficiently Understood for Literary Criticism: Þing Gehegan and Senoþ Gehegan." ''Old English Poetry: Essays on Style''. Ed. Daniel G. Calder. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979. 67–90.&lt;/ref&gt; by exploring the term ''ides'' as "lady" when discussing Grendel's mother, such as Temple ("Grendel's Lady-Mother," 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Mary Kay. "Beowulf 1258–1266: Grendel's Lady Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 23.3 (March 1986): 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and Taylor&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith. "Beowulf 1259a: The Inherent Nobility of Grendel's Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 31.3 (March 1994): 13–25.&lt;/ref&gt; (who argues in his 1994 essay that the term ''Ides'' indicates that "Grendel's mother is a woman of inherently noble status.")&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith. "Beowulf 1259a: The Inherent Nobility of Grendel's Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 31.3 (March 1994): 18&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, others have suggested that Grendel's mother may be associated with the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] figures of the [[valkyrie]]s and of the goddess [[Gefjun|Gefion]] who may be an extension of [[Gefjun#Possible connections with Frigg and Freyja|Frigg and Freyja]]. [[Freyja]], the daughter of the sea god [[Njörðr]], was both a [[fertility goddess]] and a goddess of [[war]], [[battle]], [[death]], [[seiðr]], [[prophecy]] and was also sometimes [[Valkyrie#Connections with Freyja|associated with the valkyries and disir]].

[[Nora Kershaw Chadwick]] (1959)&lt;ref&gt;[[Nora Kershaw Chadwick|Chadwick, Nora K.]] "The Monsters and Beowulf." ''The Anglo-Saxons: Studies in Some Aspects of Their History''. Ed. Peter ed Clemoes. London: Bowes &amp; Bowes, 1959. 171–203.&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Helen Damico]] in two works (''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition''&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Damico|Damico, Helen]]. ''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition.'' Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature")&lt;ref&gt;Damico, Helen. "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature." In ''New Readings on Women in Old English Literature''. Eds. Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. 176–89&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Grendel's mother may refer to the myth of the valkyries. Damico states:

{{quote|in both their benevolent and malevolent aspects, the valkyries are related to a generic group of half-mortal, half-supernatural beings called ''idisi'' in Old High German, ''ides'' in Old English, and ''dis'' in Old Norse, plural, ''disir''. Both groups are closely allied in aspect and function: they are armed, powerful, priestly [...] The Beowulf poet follows the tradition of depicting the valkyrie-figure as a deadly battle demon in his characterization of Grendel's Mother. As Chadwick has argued, Grendel's Mother, that ''wælgæst wæfre'' 'roaming slaughter-spirit' epitomizes the earlier concept of the valkyrie.&lt;ref name=reflex&gt;Damico, Helen. "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature." In ''New Readings on Women in Old English Literature,'' Eds. Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990: 176, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Damico later argues in ''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition'' that Wealtheow and Grendel's mother represent different aspects of the valkyries.

Frank Battaglia also draws on the term "ides" by pairing it with "dis".&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1991q2-00415 The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf]." ''Mankind Quarterly'' 31.4 (Summer 1991): 415–46.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the "dis" were "female guardian spirit[s]" with "power over the dead and choosing who would die. In this capacity [they] might be feared."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1991q2-00415 The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf]" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 433. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Battaglia thus suggests that Grendel's mother is the Early Germanic goddess Gefion (whom he states was also a form of [[Nerthus]] and Freyja).&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 415–17. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that: "in scaldic poetry the word ''dis'' means goddess [...] [[Freyja|Freyia]] herself is called ''Vanadis,'' that is, ''dis'' of the Vanir, the Scandinavian [[chthonic]], fertility deities."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 436. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Battaglia then notes that Gefion is referenced five times in the poem: l.49 (''géafon on gársecg'' – "Gefion on the waves"), l.362 (''ofer geofenes begang'' –  "over Gefion's realm"), l.515 (''geofon ýþum'' – "Gefion welled up in waves"), l.1394 (''né on gyfenes grund'' – "Ground of Gefion"), and l.1690 (''gifen géotende'' – "Gefion gushing"). In addition, he indicates that "in Old English poetry, geofon is a word for ocean which has been seen since [[Jakob Grimm]] (1968, 198) as related to the name Gefion of the Danish Earth Goddess ... power to divide land and sea is shown by representations of Gefion in Norse literature."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''The Mankind Quarterly'', page 416. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aglæcwif (warrior)===
Contemporary scholars have suggested that the use of the term "aglæcwif" indicates that Grendel's mother is a [[women warriors in literature and culture|woman warrior]]. In 1979, ''Beowulf'' scholars Kuhn and Stanley argued against Klaeber's reading of Grendel's mother. In ''Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach''&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Sherman M. "Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach." In ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl''. Eds. Irmengard Rauch and Gerald F. Carr. The Hague, New York: Mouton Publishers, 1979. 213–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman Kuhn questioned Klaeber's translations of both "aglæc-wif" and of "aglæca / æglæca" when referring to Grendel and Grendel's mother, stating that there are {{quote|five disputed instances of áglæca [three of which are in ''Beowulf''] 649, 1269, 1512 ... In the first ... the referent can be either Beowulf or Grendel. If the poet and his audience felt the word to have two meanings, 'monster', and 'hero', the ambiguity would be troublesome; but if by áglæca they understood a 'fighter', the ambiguity would be of little consequence, for battle was destined for both Beowulf and Grendel and both were fierce fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;216–217. Mouton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus Kuhn suggested aglæca should be defined as  "a fighter, valiant warrior, dangerous opponent, one who struggles fiercely". &lt;ref name="Kuhn218"&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl'', p.&amp;nbsp;218. Mouton Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; He supported his argument by also stating that, "if there were one clear instance of áglæca referring to an unwarlike monster, a peaceful demon, or the like, this definition would fall apart."&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl'', p.&amp;nbsp;227. Mouton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn concluded that {{quote|Grendel's mother was an 'aglæc-wif', 'a female warrior' [...] there is no more reason to introduce the idea of monstrosity or of misery here than there is in line 1519 where she is called ''merewif'', defined simply as 'water-woman', 'woman of the mere'.&lt;ref name="Kuhn218"/&gt;}}

[[Eric Stanley]] added to the debate by critiquing both Klaeber and Gillam: {{quote|Grendel is described as an æglæca, a word which we do not understand. One scholar [Gillam] has, in fact, made investigation of this word a model for the methodology of establishing meaning. The attempt is of interest, but in the end we always come back to the fact that, as Klaeber's glossary shows, the word is used by the poet not only to describe Grendel as here, and later in the poem to describe the dragon, and the monsters of the mere as they attack Beowulf, but also Beowulf himself; and at one point the two enemies, Beowulf and the dragon, are described together using the plural æglæcean. As we assemble the many uses including compounds [...] it becomes clear that it is not pejorative in force. We must not follow Klaeber's distinction of 'wretch, monster, demon, fiend' for Beowulf's enemies, and 'warrior, hero' for Beowulf himself; and we must not abuse Grendel's mother when she is called aglæcwif by translating the word as Klaeber does, 'wretch,' or 'monster, of a woman.' We must never forget that she is called there ides aglæcwif (1259) and ''[[Idis (Germanic)|ides]]'', 'lady,' is not a term of abuse [...] the poet does not speak of his monsters abusively.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, E.G. (1979). "Two Old English Poetic Phrases Insufficiently Understood for Literary Criticism : Þing Gehegan and Senoþ Gehegan." ''Old English Poetry: Essays on Style'', pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Other scholars have offered varying opinions on this topic. Christine Alfano also questioned standard translations related to Grendel's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Alfano, Christine.  (1992). "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol23/iss1/art1/ The Issue of Feminine Monstrosity: A Re-evaluation of Grendel's Mother]." ''Comitatus'', 23: 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; She states that she found a "noticeable disparity between the Grendel's mother originally created by the ''Beowulf'' poet and the one that occupies contemporary ''Beowulf'' translations. Instead of being what Sherman Kuhn calls a 'female warrior', the modern Grendel's mother is a monster. This assumption informs almost all areas of ''Beowulf'' scholarship, although there is little evidence for this characterization in the original Anglo-Saxon work."&lt;ref&gt;Alfano, Christine.  (1992). "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol23/iss1/art1/ The Issue of Feminine Monstrosity: A Re-evaluation of Grendel's Mother]." ''Comitatus'', 23: 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Melinda Menzer offered a different approach,&lt;ref&gt;Menzer, Melinda J. (September 1996). "Aglaecwif (Beowulf 1259a): Implications for -Wif Compounds, Grendel's Mother, and Other Aglaecan." ''English language notes'' 34.1: 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that "aglæcwif denotes a woman, a human female, who is also aglæca."&lt;ref&gt;Menzer, Melinda J. (September 1996). "Aglaecwif (Beowulf 1259a): Implications for -Wif Compounds, Grendel's Mother, and Other Aglaecan." English language notes 34.1: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hippalectryon''' or '''hippalektryon''' ({{lang-el|ἱππαλεκτρυών}}), is a type of fantastic [[Hybrid (mythology)|hybrid creature]] of Ancient Greek folklore, half-[[horse]] (front) and half-[[chicken|rooster]] (hind), including the tail, wings and hind legs. Its colour varies between yellow and reddish. No myths related to it are currently known.

The oldest representation currently known dates back to the 9th century BCE, and the motif grows most common in the 6th century, notably in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]] and sometimes as statues, often shown with a rider. It is also featured on some pieces of currency. A few literary works of the 5th century mention the beast, most notably [[Aeschylus]] and [[Aristophanes]], who used it as one of his favourite insults.

The precise function of the Hippalectryon remains a mystery; as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] and prophylactic animal, it might have been dedicated to [[Poseidon]] and tasked to protect ships. Other studies interpret it as a grotesque beast to amuse children, or a simple fantastic decorative element without any specific function.

== Etymology ==
The term "hippalectryon", also transcribed "hippalektryon", comes directly from Ancient Greek "ἱππαλεκτρυών", a compound word that comprises ἵππος (''híppos'', "horse"), and ἀλεκτρυών (''alektryốn'', "rooster").&lt;ref name="Theoi" /&gt; The name is thus a plain description of the hybrid creature.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; The name seems to have been used for the first time by [[Aeschylus]] in ''Myrmidons'';&lt;ref name="Perdrizet"&gt;Perdrizet, [https://archive.org/stream/revuedesetudesa06pari/revuedesetudesa06pari_djvu.txt ''L'hippalectryon. Contribution à l'étude de l'ionisme''], in ''Revue des études anciennes'', tome 6, 1904, pages 7-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavalry"&gt;John McK. Camp, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=LQCSBIjycPoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT3&amp;dq=Hippalektryon ''Horses and horsemanship in the Athenian Agora''], ASCSA 1998, volume 24  of ''Athenian Agora Picture Bks'', {{ISBN|9780876616390}}&lt;/ref&gt; the comic usage made by Aristophanes suggests that by the end of the 5th Century, most of the inhabitants of Athens had never heard about the creature.&lt;ref name="Perseus"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Hippalectryon.svg|thumb]]
In [[The Birds (play)|''The Birds'']], [[Aristophanes]] describes the hippalectryon as a yellow-feathered, awkward-looking creature.&lt;ref name="Birds" /&gt; The appearance of the creature is consistent amongst the known artistic representations. It involves a horse front part, including the head, withers and the front legs; the hind part is that of a rooster, including the wings, tail and legs.

A text attributed to [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] mentions three different types of hippalectryons: a giant rooster; a giant vulture; and a creature close to [[griffin]]s as painted on fabrics from Persia.&lt;ref name="Birds"&gt;{{en icon}} W. Geoffrey Arnott, ''Birds in the ancient world from A to Z'' Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|0-415-23851-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23851-9}}, p.102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some confusion might have arisen, as some texts also refer to hippalectryons as plain horses, a coat-of-arms,  or as sea monsters.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;  Before [[Aeschylus]], no specific term appears to refer to representations of hippalectryons.&lt;ref name="Swets" /&gt;

=== Ceramic and sculpture ===
[[File:Terracotta hippalektryon Louvre CA1792-stitched-black.jpg|thumb|Warrior riding a hippalectryon, terra cotta from [[Thebes, Greece]], 500 to 470 BCE, Louvre museum]]
The oldest known representation of a hippalectryon is an [[Askos (pottery vessel)|askos]] from [[Knossos]], dating back to the 9th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Birds" /&gt;

Hippalectryons become a common theme from 575 to 480 BCE,&lt;ref name="Birds" /&gt; often depicted with an unarmed rider, typically a young boy.&lt;ref name="Perseus" /&gt;

The motif might not be an ancient Greek invention: an analysis of Aristophanes' works suggests that it could have originated in the Middle East, and the costumes worn by the people featured on pottery with hippalectryons seem to be Asian,&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; though this particular point is a matter of debate.&lt;ref name="Birds" /&gt;

Hippalectryons are displayed almost exclusively&lt;ref name="Perseus" /&gt; on [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] vases from Attica,&lt;ref name="Theoi" /&gt; and could constitute an alternative representation of [[Pegasus]].&lt;ref name="Theoi"&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Hippalektryon.html Hippalectryon] on [http://www.theoi.com Theoi].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hybrid (mythology)|Hybrids]] are a popular and common theme in archaic Greek sculpture and vase painting.&lt;ref name="Perseus"&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0047%3Aentry%3D64 Hippalektryon] par Harvey Alan Shapiro : ''Art, Myth and Culture. Greek Vases from Southern Collections'' on [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ Perseus].&lt;/ref&gt; Most hybrids appear to have reached Greece from the East, although no early representation of a hippalectryon in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian or Middle Eastern art has yet been found.&lt;ref name="Perseus" /&gt;

Hippalectryons have been found on engraved stones from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]]. Though they differ from 6th century Attic and Ionic representations, the horse head and the rooster legs and tail are featured.&lt;ref name="Swets" /&gt;

=== Numismatics ===
Five coins featuring a hippalectryon, or possibly Pegasus, were found in 1868 in the Volterra treasure, amongst 65 very old pieces of currency

== Symbolism ==
According to a study of [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Frogs]]'', hippalectryons were often painted on shields. A [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] vase featuring Athena waving a shield sporting a hippalectryon has been found; the theme probably was credited with [[apotropaic]] and [[prophylactic]] virtues.&lt;ref name="Birds" /&gt; Roosters are prophylactic as they are a symbol of solar power &lt;ref&gt;Hippalectryons are thus described in Juan Eduardo Cirlot, Jack Sage et Herbert Read, ''A dictionary of symbols'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-415-03649-8}}, p. 149 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=_pbKl-UIO_gC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Hippalectryon&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1900&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=BOOKS].&lt;/ref&gt; that routs demons with its singing at sunrise.&lt;ref name="Swets"/&gt; Horses, especially winged horses, are a funerary symbol as they guide the souls of the dead.&lt;ref name="Swets" /&gt; The grotesque and ugly hybrid supposedly induced laughter, thereby driving evil away.&lt;ref name="Swets" /&gt;

The Hippalectryon described in [[Aeschylus]]' [[Achilleis (trilogy)|''Myrmidons'']] was probably sculpted to commemorate a naval high deed. In ''The Frogs'', [[Aristophanes]] states that the motif was painted on galleys in ancient times, indicating that it could have been credited with magical powers to protect ships.&lt;ref name="Swets"/&gt;

== Occurrences in Greek texts ==
Hippalectryons are not associated with any known myth or legend.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;''Harper's New Monthly Magazine March to May 1882'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-4191-7390-5}}  [https://books.google.fr/books?id=bgegGvYpwRIC&amp;pg=PA591&amp;dq=Hippalectryon&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1900&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=BOOKS#PPA591,M1].&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, they are scarcely mentioned by Greek authors.&lt;ref name="Perseus"/&gt;

Aeschylus is the first to mention them: in ''Myrmidons'', he describes a ship featuring a "fire-coloured horse-chanticleer".&lt;ref name="Swets"/&gt;

==In popular culture ==
* Hippalectyons are seldom mentioned in modern works. There might be an occurrence in ''[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]'', a [[nursery rhyme]] published in  ''[[Mother Goose]]'' English translation, published in 1729:&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt; 
{{cquote|'''Roundelay : '''
''Ride a '''cock-horse''''' &lt;br /&gt;

''Ride on a white horse; '' &lt;br /&gt;
''Rings on her fingers, '' &lt;br /&gt;
''Bells on her toes, '' &lt;br /&gt;
''She shall have music '' &lt;br /&gt;
''Wherever she goes.'' }}

* Hippalektryons appear in the ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians]]'' series, in the fourth book,  ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]''. They are thought to be extinct, but there are some at [[Geryon]]'s Ranch.

* Hippalektryons also feature in the third book of the ''Thrones and Bones'' trilogy, ''Skyborn'', by [[Lou Anders]]. Karn and Asterius, the minotaur prince, use them to escape from the Thican soldiers at Caldera.

[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|''Birthday Book Printing'', the fourth of the six [[Walk of Ideas]] sculptures displayed in [[Berlin]] during 2006, represents a pile of modern [[codex]] books.]]

The '''history of books''' starts with the [[History of writing|development of writing]], and various other inventions such as [[paper]] and [[printing]], and continues through to the modern day business of [[book printing]]. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of [[papyrus]]. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as [[codices]] appeared. These gave way to [[printing press|press-printed]] volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the [[e-book]]. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of [[Braille]] and spoken books.

== Clay tablets ==
[[File:Tablet describing goddess Inanna's battle with the mountain Ebih, Sumerian - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07117.JPG|thumb|[[Sumer]]ian [[clay tablet]], currently housed in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]], inscribed with the text of the poem ''[[Inanna#Justice myths|Inanna and Ebih]]'' by the priestess [[Enheduanna]], the first author whose name is known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clay tablets were used in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At [[Nineveh]], over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of [[Assyria]], who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/educator/modules/gutenberg/books/early/|title=Early Writing|website=www.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing ===
Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
{{Main|Papyrus}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian Papyrus]]

After extracting the marrow from the stems of '''Papyrus reed''', a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/how-ancient-papyrus-was-made|title=How Ancient Papyrus Was Made {{!}} U-M Library|website=www.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egypt]], papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books. The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance''. American Library Association / The British Library 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian [[scribes]] was called [[hieratic]], or sacerdotal writing; it is not [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papyrus]] books were in the form of a [[scroll]] of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more.  Some books, such as the history of the reign of [[Ramses III]], were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the [[Book of the Dead]], from the early 2nd millennium BC).

== East Asia ==

Before the introduction of books, writing on [[Oracle bone|bone]], shells, [[Bamboo and wooden slips|wood]] and [[silk]] was prevalent in [[China]] long before the 2nd century BC, until [[paper]] was invented in China around the 1st century AD. China's first recognizable books, called jiance or jiandu, were made of rolls of thin split and dried bamboo bound together with hemp, silk, or leather.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2011, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the process using the bark of the blackberry bush to create paper is attributed to [[Cai Lun|Ts'ai Lun]] (the cousin of Kar-Shun), but it may be older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/amp/collection/museum_invention_paper.htm|title=Invention of Paper|website=www.ipst.gatech.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts were reproduced by [[woodblock printing]]; the diffusion of Buddhist texts was a main impetus to large-scale production. The format of the book evolved with intermediate stages of scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style, scrolls bound at one edge ("butterfly books") and so on.

Although there is no exact date known, between 618 and 907 AD–The period of the Tang Dynasty–the first printing of books started in China.&lt;ref name=mcd&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|title=A social history of the Chinese book: Books and literati culture in late imperial China|year=2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-209-782-7|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancientpages.com/2017/09/25/ancient-romans-invented-first-bound-book/|title=Ancient Romans Invented The First Bound Book {{!}} Ancient Pages|date=2017-09-25|work=Ancient Pages|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant printed book is a work of the [[Diamond Sutra]] and dates back to 868 AD, during the Tang Dynasty.&lt;ref name=mcd /&gt; The Diamond Sutra was printed by method of [[woodblock printing]], a strenuous method in which the text to be printed would be carved into a woodblock's surface, essentially to be used to stamp the words onto the writing surface medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/3-2-history-of-books/|title=3.2 History of Books {{!}} Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication|website=open.lib.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodblock printing was a common process for the reproduction of already handwritten texts during the earliest stages of book printing. This process was incredibly time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the meticulous and time-consuming process that woodblock printing was, [[Bi Sheng]], a key contributor to the history of printing, invented the process of [[Movable type|movable type printing]] (1041-1048 AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/invention-woodblock-printing-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279|title=The Invention of Woodblock Printing in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|work=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Education|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/movableprt.shtml|title=The Invention of Movable Type|last=Lee|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|website=www.silk-road.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi Sheng developed a printing process in which written text could be copied with the use of formed character types, the earliest types being made of [[ceramic]] or clay material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The method of movable type printing would later become improved by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-columbian codices of the Americas ==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dresden Codex]] (page 49)]]

In Mesoamerica, information was recorded on long strips of paper, agave fibers, or animal hides, which were then folded and protected by wooden covers.  These were thought to have existed since the time of the Classical Period between the 3rd and 8th centuries, CE.  Many of these codices were thought to contain astrological information, religious calendars, knowledge about the gods, genealogies of the rulers, cartographic information, and tribute collection.  Many of these codices were stored in temples but were ultimately destroyed by the Spanish explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, M.E. &amp; Wooudhuysen, H.R. (2013). The book: A global history. Oxford, Oxford University Press. Pages 656–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the only completely deciphered pre-Columbian writing system is the [[Maya script]].  The Maya, along with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|several]] other cultures in [[Mesoamerica]], constructed concertina-style books written on [[Amate]] paper. Nearly all Mayan texts were [[Diego de Landa|destroyed]] by the Spanish during colonization on cultural and religious grounds.  One of the few surviving examples is the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/pt/item/11621/ |title = O Códice de Dresden |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1200–1250 |accessdate = 2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although only the Maya have been shown to have a writing system capable of conveying any concept that can be conveyed via speech (at about the same level as the modern [[Japanese writing system]]), other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures had more rudimentary [[Ideogram|ideographical writing systems]] which were contained in similar concertina-style books, one such example being the [[Aztec codices]].

=== Florentine Codex ===
There are more than 2,000 illustrations drawn by native artists that represent this era. Bernardino de Sahagun tells the story of Aztec people’s lives and their natural history. The Florentine Codex speaks about the culture religious cosmology and ritual practices, society, economics, and natural history of the Aztec people. The manuscript are arranged in both the Nahuatl language and in Spanish. The English translation of the complete Nahuatl text of all twelve volumes of the Florentine Codex took ten years. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble had a decade of long work but made it an important contribution to Mesoamerican ethnohistory. Years later, in 1979, the Mexican government published a full-color volume  of the Florentine Codex. Now, since 2012, it is available digitally and fully accessible to those interested in Mexican and Aztec History.

The Florentine Codex is a 16th century ethnographic research study brought about by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The codex itself was actually named ''La Historia Universal de las Cosas de Nueva España.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516552.|title=Project MUSE|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernardino de Sahagun worked on this project from 1545 up until his death in 1590. The Florentine Codex consist of twelve books. It is 2400 pages long but divided into the twelve books by categories such as; The Gods, Ceremonies, Omens, and other cultural aspects of Aztec people.

== Wax tablets ==
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|right|Woman holding wax tablets in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]

Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or ''pugillares'' upon which they could write and erase by using a [[stylus]]. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a [[codex]]. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press 2003 [reprint], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parchment ==
{{Main|Parchment}}

Parchment progressively replaced [[papyrus]].  Legend attributes its invention to [[Eumenes II]], the king of [[Pergamon]], from which comes the name "pergamineum," which became "parchment."  Its production began around the 3rd century BC.  Made using the skins of animals (sheep, cattle, donkey, antelope, etc.), parchment proved to be easier to conserve over time; it was more solid, and allowed one to erase text.  It was a very expensive medium because of the rarity of material and the time required to produce a document. [[Vellum]] is the finest quality of parchment.

=== Greece and Rome ===
The scroll of [[papyrus]] is called "volumen" in Latin, a word which signifies "circular movement," "roll," "spiral," "whirlpool," "revolution" (similar, perhaps, to the modern English interpretation of "swirl") and finally "a roll of writing paper, a rolled manuscript, or a book."
In the 7th century [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the relation between codex, book and scroll in his ''Etymologiae'' (VI.13) as this:
{{cquote|A codex is composed of many books (''librorum''); a book is of one scroll (''voluminis''). It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''caudex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.}}

=== Description ===
The scroll is rolled around two vertical wooden axes.  This design allows only sequential usage; one is obliged to read the text in the order in which it is written, and it is impossible to place a marker in order to directly access a precise point in the text.  It is comparable to modern video cassettes.  Moreover, the reader must use both hands to hold on to the vertical wooden rolls and therefore cannot read and write at the same time.  The only volumen in common usage today is the Jewish [[Torah]].

=== Book culture ===
The authors of [[ancient history|Antiquity]] had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights.  Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents.  Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous.  This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve.  The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.

From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of [[Protagoras]] were burned because he was a proponent of [[agnosticism]] and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of Christian texts.  Some [[Christians]] later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts.  These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today.  A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty.  It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]], who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors.  This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power.  However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

=== Proliferation and conservation of books in Greece ===
Little information concerning books in Ancient [[Greece]] survives.  Several vases (6th and 5th centuries BC) bear images of volumina.  There was undoubtedly no extensive trade in books, but there existed several sites devoted to the sale of books.

The spread of books, and attention to their cataloging and conservation, as well as literary criticism developed during the [[Hellenistic]] period with the creation of large libraries in response to the desire for knowledge exemplified by [[Aristotle]].  These libraries were undoubtedly also built as demonstrations of political prestige:
* The [[Library of Alexandria]], a library created by [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy Soter]] and set up by [[Demetrius Phalereus]] (Demetrius of Phaleron). It contained 500,900 volumes (in the ''Museion'' section) and 40,000 at the Serapis temple (''Serapeion''). All books in the luggage of visitors to Egypt were inspected, and could be held for copying. The Museion was partially destroyed in 47 BC.
* The Library at [[Pergamon]], founded by [[Attalus I]]; it contained 200,000 volumes which were moved to the Serapeion by [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], after the destruction of the Museion. The Serapeion was partially destroyed in 391, and the last books disappeared in 641 CE following the [[Arab]] conquest.
* The Library at [[Athens]], the ''Ptolemaion'', which gained importance following the destruction of the [[Library at Alexandria]] ; the [[Library of Pantainos]], around 100 CE; the library of [[Hadrian]], in 132 CE.
* The Library at [[Rhodes]], a library that rivaled the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* The Library at [[Antioch]], a public library of which [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] was the director near the end of the 3rd century.

The libraries had copyist workshops, and the general organisation of books allowed for the following:
* Conservation of an example of each text
* Translation (the [[Septuagint]] [[Bible]], for example)
* Literary criticisms in order to establish reference texts for the copy (example : ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]'')
* A catalog of books
* The copy itself, which allowed books to be disseminated

=== Book production in Rome ===
Book production developed in [[Rome]] in the 1st century BC with Latin literature that had been influenced by the Greek. Conservative estimates places the number of potential readers in Imperial Rome at around 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|title=Scrolling Down the Ages|last=Beard|first=Mary|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629200012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Beard-t.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|dead-url=|quote=Imperial Rome had a population of at least a million. Using a conservative estimate of literacy levels, there would have been more than 100,000 readers in the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This diffusion primarily concerned circles of literary individuals.  [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]] was the editor of his friend [[Cicero]].  However, the book business progressively extended itself through the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, there were bookstores in [[Lyon]].  The spread of the book was aided by the extension of the Empire, which implied the imposition of the [[Latin]] tongue on a great number of people (in Spain, Africa, etc.).

[[Library|Libraries]] were private or created at the behest of an individual. [[Julius Caesar]], for example, wanted to establish one in Rome, proving that libraries were signs of political prestige.

In the year 377, there were 28 libraries in Rome, and it is known that there were many smaller libraries in other cities. Despite the great distribution of books, scientists do not have a complete picture as to the literary scene in antiquity as thousands of books have been lost through time.

== Paper ==
{{Main|History of paper}}

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China about AD 105, when [[Cai Lun]], an official attached to the Imperial court during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), created a sheet of paper using [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishnets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While paper used for wrapping and padding was used in China since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;  paper used as a writing medium only became widespread by the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century in China, sheets of paper were beginning to be used for [[toilet paper]] as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;[[#Needham, V 1|Needham, V 1]], p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD) paper was folded and sewn into square [[tea bag|bags]] to preserve the flavor of tea.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) that followed was the first government to issue [[banknote|paper currency]].

An important development was the mechanization of paper manufacture by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] papermakers. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to the 11th century in Córdoba, Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Robert I.: "Paper comes to the West, 800–1400", in: Lindgren, Uta: ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800 bis 1400.

== Middle Ages ==
{{Main|Manuscript culture|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:Codex Manesse Ulrich von Singenberg.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[codex Manesse]]'', a book from the Middle Ages]]

By the end of antiquity, between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the [[scroll]] was replaced by the [[codex]]. The book was no longer a continuous roll, but a collection of sheets attached at the back.  It became possible to access a precise point in the text quickly.  The codex is equally easy to rest on a table, which permits the reader to take notes while he or she is reading.  The codex form improved with the separation of words, capital letters, and punctuation, which permitted silent reading.  Tables of contents and indices facilitated direct access to information.  This form was so effective that it is still the standard book form, over 1500 years after its appearance.

Paper would progressively replace parchment.  Cheaper to produce, it allowed a greater diffusion of books.

=== Books in monasteries ===
A number of Christian books were destroyed at the order of [[Diocletian]] in 304 AD. During the turbulent periods of the invasions, it was the monasteries that conserved religious texts and certain works of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for the West.  But there would also be important copying centers in [[Byzantium]].

The role of monasteries in the conservation of books is not without some ambiguity:
* Reading was an important activity in the lives of monks, which can be divided into prayer, intellectual work, and manual labor (in the [[Benedictine]] order, for example).  It was therefore necessary to make copies of certain works.  Accordingly, there existed scriptoria (the plural of scriptorium) in many monasteries, where monks copied and decorated manuscripts that had been preserved.
* However, the conservation of books was not exclusively in order to preserve ancient culture; it was especially relevant to understanding religious texts with the aid of ancient knowledge.  Some works were never recopied, having been judged too dangerous for the monks.  Moreover, in need of blank media, the monks scraped off manuscripts, thereby destroying ancient works.  The transmission of knowledge was centered primarily on sacred texts.

=== Copying and conserving books ===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]

Despite this ambiguity, monasteries in the West and the Eastern Empire permitted the conservation of a certain number of secular texts, and several libraries were created: for example, [[Cassiodorus]] ('Vivarum' in Calabria, around 550), or [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].  There were several libraries, but the survival of books often depended on political battles and ideologies, which sometimes entailed massive destruction of books or difficulties in production (for example, the distribution of books during the [[Iconoclasm]] between 730 and 842).  A long list of very old and surviving libraries that now form part of the [[Vatican Archives]] can be found in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

A very strong example of the early copying and conserving books is that of the [[Quran]]. After Muhammad, his companion Abu Bakr, on the recommendation of Umar Bin Alkhattab, assigned Zayd bin Saabit to compile the first official scripture of the Quran. Zayd collected all the available scriptures of the Quran scripted by different companions of Muhammad during his life. He compiled one scripture and got it verified by all the companions who had memorized the whole book while Muhammad was alive. Then this first official scripture was kept at the house of Hafsa, the wife of the Muhammad. By the time of the third caliph Uthmaan, the Islamic state had spread over a large portion of the known world. He ordered the preparation of the official copies of the first official scripture. The copies were duly verified for accuracy. These copies were sent to each city of the caliphate so that further copies can be made locally with the perfect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran#Compilation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help preserve books and protect them from thieves, librarians would create [[Chained library|chained libraries]]. Chained Libraries were books displayed next to each other to create a tight bond. This eliminated unauthorised removal of books. One of the earliest chained libraries was in England during the 1500s. Popular culture also has examples of chained libraries, such as in [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] by [[J.K Rowling]].

=== The ''scriptorium'' ===
The scriptorium was the workroom of monk copyists; here, books were copied, decorated, rebound, and conserved.  The armarius directed the work and played the role of librarian.

The role of the copyist was multifaceted: for example, thanks to their work, texts circulated from one monastery to another.  Copies also allowed monks to learn texts and to perfect their religious education.  The relationship with the book thus defined itself according to an intellectual relationship with [[God]].  But if these copies were sometimes made for the monks themselves, there were also copies made on demand.

The task of copying itself had several phases: the preparation of the manuscript in the form of notebooks once the work was complete, the presentation of pages, the copying itself, revision, correction of errors, decoration, and [[bookbinding|binding]].  The book therefore required a variety of competencies, which often made a manuscript a collective effort.

=== Transformation from the literary edition in the 12th century ===

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The scene in [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Book]]'' (1480) reflects the presence of books in the houses of richer people in his time.]]
The revival of cities in Europe would change the conditions of book production and extend its influence, and the monastic period of the book would come to an end.  This revival accompanied the intellectual renaissance of the period. The [[Manuscript culture]] outside of the monastery developed in these university-cities in Europe in this time.  It is around the first universities that new structures of production developed: reference manuscripts were used by students and professors for teaching [[theology]] and liberal arts.  The development of commerce and of the bourgeoisie brought with it a demand for specialized and general texts (law, history, novels, etc.).  It is in this period that writing in the common vernacular developed (courtly poetry, novels, etc.).  Commercial scriptoria became common, and the profession of book seller came into being, sometimes dealing internationally.

There is also the creation of royal [[libraries]] as in the case of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The use of paper diffused through Europe in the 14th century.  This material, less expensive than [[parchment]], came from China via the [[Arabs]] in Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was used in particular for ordinary copies, while [[parchment]] was used for luxury editions.

== Printing press ==
{{Main|Printing press}}

The invention of the moveable type on the [[printing press]] by Johann Fust, Peter Schoffer and [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 marks the entry of the book into the industrial age.  The Western book was no longer a single object, written or reproduced by request.  The publication of a book became an enterprise, requiring capital for its realization and a market for its distribution. The cost of each individual book (in a large edition) was lowered enormously, which in turn increased the distribution of books.  The book in codex form and printed on paper, as we know it today, dates from the 15th century. Books printed before January 1, 1501, are called [[incunable]]s. The spreading of book printing all over Europe occurred relatively quickly, but most books were still printed in [[Latin]]. The spreading of the concept of printing books in the [[vernacular]] was a somewhat slower process.

== Contemporary era ==
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] more books began to pour off European presses, creating an early form of information overload for many readers.  Nowhere was this more the case than in Enlightenment Scotland, where students were exposed to a wide variety of books during their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership|journal=The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland|year=2012|volume=2|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The demands of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (founded 1804), the [[American Bible Society]] (founded 1816), and other non-denominational publishers for enormously large inexpensive runs of texts led to numerous innovations. The introduction of steam printing presses a little before 1820, closely followed by new steam paper mills, constituted the two most major innovations.  Together, they caused book prices to drop and the number of books to increase considerably.  Numerous bibliographic features, like the positioning and formulation of titles and subtitles, were also affected by this new production method.  New types of documents appeared later in the 19th century:  [[photography]], [[sound recording]] and [[film]].

[[Typewriter]]s and eventually computer based word processors and printers let people print and put together their own documents. [[Desktop publishing]] is common in the 21st century.

Among a series of developments that occurred in the 1990s, the spread of digital multimedia, which encodes texts, images, animations, and sounds in a unique and simple form was notable for the book publishing industry. [[Hypertext]] further improved access to information. Finally, the [[internet]] lowered production and distribution costs.

=== E-books and the future of the book ===
It is difficult to predict the future of the book in an era of fast-paced technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Darnton]], ''The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future'', New York, Public Affairs, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-826-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the "death of books" have been expressed throughout the history of the medium, perceived as threatened by competing media such as radio, television, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8xg8EfQnnAC|title=The Future of the Book|last=Nunberg|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpNtvB4YF2cC|title=This is Not the End of the Book: A Conversation Curated by Jean-Philippe de Tonnac|last=Carrière|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Eco|first2=Umberto|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-955245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views are generally exaggerated, and "dominated by fetishism, fears about the end of humanism and ideas of techno-fundamentalist progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballatore|first=Andrea|last2=Natale|first2=Simone|date=2015-05-18|title=E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal=New Media &amp; Society|pages=1461444815586984|doi=10.1177/1461444815586984|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print book medium has proven to be very resilient and adaptable.

A good deal of reference material, designed for direct access instead of sequential reading, as for example [[encyclopedia]]s, exists less and less in the form of books and increasingly on the web. Leisure reading materials are increasingly published in e-reader formats.

Although electronic books, or e-books, had limited success in the early years, and readers were resistant at the outset, the demand for books in this format has grown dramatically, primarily because of the popularity of e-reader devices and as the number of available titles in this format has increased. Since the [[Amazon Kindle]] was released in 2007, the e-book has become a digital phenomenon and many theorize that it will take over hardback and paper books in future. E-books are much more accessible and easier to buy and it’s also cheaper to purchase an E-Book rather than its physical counterpart due to paper expenses being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/opinion/current_events_politics/article/211256/Are-E-books-Taking-Over-the-Printed-World/|title=Are E-books Taking Over the Printed World? – Teen Politics Essay|website=www.teenink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important factor in the increasing popularity of the e-reader is its continuous diversification. Many e-readers now support basic operating systems, which facilitate email and other simple functions. The [[iPad]] is the most obvious example of this trend, but even mobile phones can host e-reading software.

== Reading for the blind ==
[[Braille]] is a system of reading and writing through the use of the finger tips. Braille was developed as a system of efficient communication for blind and partially blind alike.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/|title=History of Braille - Braille Works|work=Braille Works|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of sixty-three characters and is read left to right. These characters are made with small raised dots in two columns similar to a modern [[Dominoes|domino piece]] to represent each letter.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Braille-writing-system|title=Braille {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers can identify characters with two fingers. Reading speed averages one hundred and twenty-five words per minute and can reach two hundred words per minute.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The making of Braille ===
Braille was named after its creator [[Louis Braille]] in 1824 in [[France]]. Braille stabbed himself in the eyes at the age of three with his father's leather working tools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Braille spent nine years working on a previous system of communication called [[night writing]] by [[Charles Barbier]]. Braille published his book "procedure for writing words, music, and plainsong in dots", in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nfb.org/1829-braille-book|title=1829 Braille Book|date=2010-10-04|work=National Federation of the Blind|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 France made Braille the "official communication system for blind individuals".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Valentin Haüy]] was the first person to put Braille on paper in the form of a book.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1932 Braille became accepted and used in English speaking countries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 1965 the Nemeth Code of Braille Mathematics and Scientific Notation was created. The code was developed to assign symbols to advanced mathematical notations and operations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The system has remained the same, only minor adjustments have been made to it since its creation.

=== Spoken books ===
The spoken book was originally created in the 1930s to provide the blind and visually impaired with a medium to enjoy books. In 1932 the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] created the first recordings of spoken books on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silksoundbooks.com/history-of-audiobooks.html|title=The History of the audiobooks|last=Silksoundbooks|website=www.silksoundbooks.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, a British based foundation, [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]] (RNIB), was the first to deliver talking books to the blind on vinyl records.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each record contained about thirty minutes of audio on both sides, and the records were played on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. Spoken books changed mediums in the 1960s with the transition from vinyl records to cassette tapes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/a-short-history-of-the-audiobook-20-years-after-the-first-portable-digital-audio-device|title=A short history of the audiobook, 20 years after the first portable digital audio device|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next progression of spoken books came in the 1980s with the widespread use of compact discs. Compact discs reached more people and made it possible to listen to books in the car.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1995 the term [[audiobook]] became the industry standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, the internet enabled audiobooks to become more accessible and portable. Audiobooks could now be played in their entirety instead of being split onto multiple disks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Academic discipline==

[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
The history of the book as an [[academic discipline]] studies the production, transmission, circulation and dissemination of text from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to the present day. Its scope includes the book as object, the [[history of ideas]], [[history of religion]], [[bibliography]], [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], [[archiving|curation]] and the future of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/research/hb.html Johns, A. (1998) Research Guide: The History of the Book. Department of History and Philosophy of Science. University of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The history of the book came into existence in the latter half of the 20th century. It was fostered by [[William Ivins Jr.]]'s ''Prints and Visual Communication'' (1953) and [[Henri-Jean Martin]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]'s ''L'apparition du livre'' (''The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450–1800'') in 1958 as well as [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (1962).  Another notable pioneer in the History of the Book is [[Robert Darnton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=I.R.Willison|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/8/1/July.pdf|title=The History of the Book as a Field of Study within the Humanities|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Color perception.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The human eye's red-to-green and blue-to-yellow values of each one-wavelength visible color]]

[[Image:Cones SMJ2 E.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Normalized [[spectral sensitivity]] curves of the three kinds of [[cone cell]]s, which define the space of human color [[sensation and perception|sensation]]]]
'''Impossible colors''' or '''forbidden colors''' are supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.

==Types==
These impossible colors are of two types:
#Colors that would be seen if the output strengths of the human eye [[retina]]'s three types of [[cone cell]] (red, green, blue) could be set to values which cannot be produced by exposing the eye in normal seeing conditions to any possible combination of strengths of the frequencies of visible light.
#Colors that cannot be seen directly from any combination of retina signal output from one place in one eye, but can be generated in the brain's [[visual cortex]] by mixing color signals from the two eyes, or from more than one part of the same eye. Examples of these colors are yellowish-blue and reddish-green.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983/&gt; Those colors that appear to be similar to, for example, both red and green, or to both yellow and blue. (This does not mean the result of mixing paints of those two colors in painting, or the result of mixing lights of those two colors on a screen.)

==Opponent process==
{{Main|Opponent process}}
The color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. The three types of [[cone cell]]s have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels:
* Red versus green.
* Blue versus yellow
* Black versus white (this is achromatic and detects light-dark variation, or luminance).
Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color, and signals output from a place on the retina can contain one or the other but not both, for each opponent pair.

==Real colors==
{{multiple image |align= right |direction= horizontal |total_width= 440 |caption_align= left |image1= CIExy1931.png |width1= 542 |height1= 599 |caption1= The [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] color space [[chromaticity]] diagram. The white regions outside the black line correspond to imaginary colors. (Note that the colors in this figure do not reproduce the actual colors in the diagram, due to the [[sRGB color space|limitations of RGB computer displays]]) |image2= CIExy1931 ProPhoto.svg | width2= 476 |height2= 540 |caption2= The [[ProPhoto RGB color space]] uses imaginary green and blue primaries to obtain a larger gamut (space inside the triangle) than would be possible with three real primaries. However, some real colors are still irreproducible.}}
Real colors are colors that can be produced by a physical light source. Any [[additive color|additive mixture]] of two real colors is also a real color. When colors are displayed in the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]], additive mixture results in a color along the line between the colors being mixed. By mixing any three colors, one can therefore create any color contained in the triangle they describe — this is called the [[gamut]] formed by those three colors, which are called [[primary color]]s. Any colors outside of this triangle cannot be obtained by mixing the chosen primaries.

When defining primaries, the goal is often to leave as many real colors in gamut as possible. Since the region of real colors is not a triangle (see illustration), it is not possible to pick three real colors that span the whole region. The gamut can be increased by selecting more than three real primary colors, but since the region of real colors is not a polygon, there always will be some colors at the edge left out. Therefore, one selects colors outside of the region of real colors as primary colors; in other words, imaginary primary colors. Mathematically, the gamut created in this way contains so-called "imaginary colors".

In computer and television screen color displays, the corners of the gamut triangle are defined by commercially available [[phosphor]]s chosen to be as near as possible to pure red and pure green and pure blue, and thus are within the area of real colors; note that these color space diagrams inevitably display, instead of real colors outside your computer screen's gamut triangle, the nearest color which is inside the gamut triangle. See page [[Gamut]] for more information about the color range available on display devices.

==Imaginary colors==
One type of ''imaginary color'' (also referred to as ''non-physical'' or ''unrealizable color'') is a point in a [[color space]] that corresponds to combinations of [[cone cell]] responses in one eye, that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances seeing any possible light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html |title=Light and the eye|accessdate=May 5, 2007 |last=MacEvoy |first=Bruce |year=2005 |work=Handprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, no object can have an imaginary color. But such imaginary colors are useful as mathematical abstractions for defining [[color space]]s.

The [[spectral sensitivity]] curve of medium-wavelength ("M") cone cells overlaps those of short-wavelength ("S") and long-wavelength ("L") cone cells. Light of any [[wavelength]] that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones, or both, to some extent. Therefore, no wavelength (except perhaps a bit of the far red), and no non-negative [[spectral power distribution]], excites only one sort of cone. If, for example, M cones could be excited alone, this would make the brain see an imaginary color greener than any physically possible green; producing it by seeing light would need some of the red and blue parts of visible light to have negative power, which is impossible. Such a "hyper-green" color would be in the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram (left image to the right) in the blank area above the colored area and between the ''y''-axis and the line ''x''+''y''=1.

==Chimerical colors==
[[File:chimerical-color-demo.svg|thumb|By staring at a "fatigue template" for 20-60 seconds, then switching to a neutral target, it is possible to view "impossible" colors.]]
A ''chimerical color'' is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color for a while until some of the cone cells become fatigued, temporarily changing their color sensitivities, and then looking at a markedly different color. They are explained by the [[opponent process]] color theory.&lt;ref name=Churchland_2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimerical Colors: Some Phenomenological Predictions from Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2005|last1=Churchland|first1=Paul|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=527–560|doi=10.1080/09515080500264115}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, staring at a saturated primary-color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue, causing an [[afterimage]] of the [[complementary colors]]. Exploration of the color space outside the range of "real colors" by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent process theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors (e.g. "yellowish blue").&lt;ref name="Churchland_2005"/&gt; Chimerical colors include:
* Stygian colors: these are simultaneously dark and impossibly saturated. For example, to see "stygian blue": staring at bright yellow causes a dark blue [[afterimage]], then on looking at black, the blue is seen as blue against the black, but due to lack of the usual brightness contrast it seems to be as dark as the black. 
* Self-luminous colors: these mimic the effect of a glowing material, even when viewed on a medium such as paper, which can only reflect and not emit its own light. For example, to see "self-luminous red": staring at green causes a red afterimage, then on looking at white, the red is seen against the white and may seem to be brighter than the white.
* Hyperbolic colors: these are impossibly highly saturated. For example, to see "hyperbolic orange": staring at bright cyan causes an orange afterimage, then on looking at orange, the resulting orange afterimage seen against the orange background may cause an orange color purer than the purest orange color that can be made by any normally-seen light. Or, staring at something pure magenta in bright sunlight for two minutes or more, thus temporarily making the red and blue cones less sensitive, and then looking at green leaves, may result in briefly seeing an unnaturally pure green afterimage.

==Claimed evidence for ability to see colors not in the color space==

[[File:Impossible Colors, Blue and Yellow.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Yellow–Blue" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

[[File:Impossible Colors, Red and Green.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Red–Green" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

Under normal circumstances, there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues; that is, as a hue looking "redgreen" or "yellowblue".

In 1983, [[Hewitt D. Crane]] and Thomas P. Piantanida performed tests using an [[Eye tracking|eye-tracker]] device that had a field of a vertical red stripe adjacent to a vertical green stripe, or several narrow alternating red and green stripes (or in some cases, yellow and blue instead). The device could track involuntary movements of one eye (there was a patch over the other eye) and adjust mirrors so the image would follow the eye and the boundaries of the stripes were always on the same places on the eye's retina; the field outside the stripes was blanked with occluders. Under such conditions, the edges between the stripes seemed to disappear (perhaps due to edge-detecting [[neuron]]s becoming fatigued) and the colors flowed into each other in the brain's [[visual cortex]], overriding the opponency mechanisms and producing not the color expected from mixing paints or from mixing lights on a screen, but new colors entirely, which are not in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], either in its real part or in its imaginary parts. For red-and-green, some saw an even field of the new color; some saw a regular pattern of just-visible green dots and red dots; some saw islands of one color on a background of the other color. Some of the volunteers for the experiment reported that afterwards, they could still imagine the new colors for a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.221.4615.1078 |jstor=1691544 |title=On Seeing Reddish Green and Yellowish Blue |year=1983 |last1=Crane |first1=Hewitt D. |last2=Piantanida |first2=Thomas P. |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4615 |pages=1078–80 |pmid=17736657}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some observers indicated that although they were aware that what they were viewing was a color (that is, the field was not achromatic), they were unable to name or describe the color. One of these observers was an artist with a large color vocabulary. Other observers of the novel hues described the first stimulus as a reddish-green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suarez J|
title=Reddish Green: A Challenge for Modal Claims About Phenomenal Structure|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00247.x | year=2009 | last2=Suarez | first2=Juan | volume=78 | issue=2 | pages=346–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001 Vincent A. Billock and Gerald A. Gleason and Brian H. Tsou set up an experiment to test a theory that the 1983 experiment did not control for variations in the perceived [[luminance]] of the colors from subject to subject: two colors are equiluminant for an observer when rapidly alternating between the colors produces the least impression of flickering. The 2001 experiment was similar but controlled for luminance.&lt;ref name="josaa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billock|first=Vincent A.|author2=Gerald A. Gleason |author3=Brian H. Tsou |year=2001|url=http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/BillockEtAlImpossibleColorsJOSA2001.pdf|title=Perception of forbidden colors in retinally stabilized equiluminant images: an indication of softwired cortical color opponency?|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|publisher=Optical Society of America|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2398–2403|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.18.002398|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had these observations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some subjects (4 out of 7) described transparency phenomena—as though the opponent colors originated in two depth planes and could be seen, one through the other. ...

We found that when colors were equiluminant, subjects saw reddish greens, bluish yellows, or a multistable spatial color exchange (an entirely novel perceptual phenomena {{sic}}); when the colors were nonequiluminant, subjects saw spurious pattern formation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This led them to propose a "soft-wired model of cortical color opponency", in which populations of neurons compete to fire and in which the "losing" neurons go completely silent. In this model, eliminating competition by, for instance, inhibiting connections between neural populations can allow mutually exclusive neurons to fire together.&lt;ref name="josaa"/&gt;

Hsieh and Tse in 2006 disputed the existence of colors forbidden by opponency theory and claimed they are, in reality, intermediate colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.030 |title=Illusory color mixing upon perceptual fading and filling-in does not result in "forbidden colors" |year=2006 |last1=Hsieh |first1=P.-J. |last2=Tse |first2=P.

'''''In the Land of Pain''''' is a collection of notes by [[Alphonse Daudet]] chronicling the pain and suffering he experienced from [[tabes dorsalis]], its effects on his relationships with friends, family, and other people, and the various drugs he took and physical treatments he underwent in his fight against the disease. Daudet originally began making these notes for a projected book, but none of the material was published in his lifetime. He planned to use the title ''La Doulou'', a [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] word for pain. The collection was published in French in 1930 in a volume titled ''La Doulou (La Douleur): 1887–1895 et Le Trésor d'Arlatan: 1897'', and translated into English in 2002 by [[Julian Barnes]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s02X_Gm90ncC&amp;dq=in+the+land+of+pain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAn4UpX9AsT_oQTW2YCACA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA | title=''Introduction to'' In the Land of Pain | publisher=Knopf | author=Barnes, Julian | year=2002 | location=New York | pages=V-XV | isbn=0-375-41485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bouloumié |editor1-first=Arlette |title=Écriture et maladie: "du bon usage des maladies" |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bdlkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22La+Douleur%22+%22Ce+volume+constitue+l%27%C3%A9dition+originale+de+La+Doulou.%22&amp;dq=%22La+Douleur%22+%22Ce+volume+constitue+l%27%C3%A9dition+originale+de+La+Doulou.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=77v4UsnaA6iw7Qbni4CwBQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |location=Paris |publisher=Imago |publication-date=2003 |page=117 |isbn=2911416767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
Daudet records observations, experiences, and aphorisms related to his intense suffering over the course of many years. He describes his symptoms in graphic detail and charts their progression. This begins with isolated attacks of agonising nerve pain, and eventually becomes a daily litany of pain and use of drugs like opium and [[chloral hydrate]] to fight it. He comments on the effect of his illness on family and friends, and on his outlook on life.

He describes the different physical treatments he underwent, including being suspended in the air, diets, and a variety of injections. He also details his observations of fellow sufferers of the disease and his interactions with them. In his later years, he frequently spent time at sanitariums, becoming a celebrity among the other patients. He describes his time at these sanitariums in detail. Daudet stopped making these notes a few years before his death.

==Critical response==
Daudet originally planned to use his notes on his sufferings to make either a novel or an autobiography. After discussing the projected work with fellow writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]], Goncourt predicted the work would be superb because Daudet would be writing from intense personal experience. Although the book was never realized, translator Julian Barnes agrees with Goncourt's prediction in relation to the collection in its current form. He believes the notes format is appropriate and fitting for the subject because of its implication of passing time and its absence of disguise.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

According to critic Richard Eder, this work is worthy of lasting recognition. Daudet uses wit to probe a dark and distressing subject, providing the reader with powerful images. Daudet surprisingly responds to his pain often with humor and spirit, and even comments mockingly on his disease and its symptoms at times. Some of the most poignant moments in the book are Daudet's expressions of sympathy for his fellow sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/books/another-country.html | title=Another Country | publisher=New York Times | date=2 February 2003 | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Eder, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4951">'''J. M. Condé''' was an early 20th century "golden age" book illustrator and comic strip artist best known for his ink and watercolor illustrations for books by [[Joel Chandler Harris]] and [[Albert Bigelow Paine]]. He also worked on at least two comic strips, one of which was derived from Harris's "[[Br'er Rabbit]]" stories.

==Career==

Condé worked in what is known as the golden age of American illustration in the early 20th century. His energetic line work calls to mind the work of his contemporary  [[A. B. Frost]], while his use of vivid color evokes [[Winsor McKay]]. He specialized in illustrations of animals in books for children.

Condé  illustrated the "Hollow Tree" books of Albert Bigelow Paine and some of Joel Chandler Harris's "Uncle Remus" stories, as well as books by [[Martha Strudwick Young]] and ''[[Aesop's Fables]]''. Like some other illustrators of the day, Condé attempted to show animals as if drawn from life, though he also followed the 'humanizing' line of traditional animal fables and usually clothed his animal characters in trousers and coat or shirt, and sometimes shoes as well.&lt;ref name=kensinger/&gt;&lt;ref name=ui/&gt;

From June to October 1906, the McClure Syndicate ran a Sunday color comic strip entitled ''Brer Rabbit'' (sometimes referred to as ''Uncle Remus Stories''), based on Harris's stories and drawn by Condé. There were 16 episodes in the series, each with its own title, such as "Brer Rabbit &amp; the Gold Mine."&lt;ref name=strippersguide/&gt;

Another comic strip from Condé was ''Aubrey of the Tenements'' (1904), which featured a cat named Aubrey and his nameless friend, a talkative and rude parrot who gets them both into all kinds of mischief after they move from the slums to an upper-class home.&lt;ref name=barnacle/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画||kaiga, also gadō 画道}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art|Japanese visual arts]], encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the long history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and the adaptation of imported ideas, mainly from [[Chinese painting]] which was especially influential at a number of points; significant [[Western painting|Western]] influence only comes from the later 16th century onwards, beginning at the same time as Japanese art [[Japonisme|was influencing that of the West]]. 

Areas of subject matter where Chinese influence has been repeatedly significant include Buddhist religious painting, [[ink-wash painting]] of landscapes in the Chinese [[literati painting]] tradition, calligraphy of ideographs,&lt;ref&gt;J. Conder, Paintings and studies by Kawanabe Kyôsai, 1911, Kawanabe Kyôsai Memorial Museum, Japan: "It is sometimes said that Japanese painting is merely another kind of writing, but..." p.27&lt;/ref&gt; and the painting of animals and plants, especially birds and flowers.  However distinctively Japanese traditions have developed in all these fields.  The subject matter that is widely regarded as most characteristic of Japanese painting, and later [[printmaking]], is the depiction of scenes from everyday life and narrative scenes that are often crowded with figures and detail.  This tradition no doubt began in the early medieval period under Chinese influence that is now beyond tracing except in the most general terms, but from the period of the earliest surviving works had developed into a specifically Japanese tradition that lasted until the modern period.

The official [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)]] includes 158 works or sets of works from the 8th to the 19th century (though including a number of Chinese paintings that have long been in Japan) that represent peaks of achievement, or very rare survivals from early periods.

==Timeline==

===Ancient Japan and Asuka period (until 710)===
The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple figural representations, as well as botanical, architectural, and geometric designs are found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300 BC – 300 AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figural designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus|tumuli]] dating to the [[Kofun period]] and [[Asuka period]] (300–700 AD).

Along with the introduction of the Chinese writing system (''[[kanji]]''), Chinese modes of governmental administration, and [[Buddhism]] in the [[Asuka period]], many art works were imported into Japan from [[China]] and local copies in similar styles began to be produced.

===Nara period (710–794)===
[[File:Takamatsuzuka tomb mural.jpg|thumb|Mural painting from the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]]]]

With the further establishment of [[Buddhism]] in 6th- and 7th-century Japan, religious painting flourished and was used to adorn numerous temples erected by the aristocracy. However, [[Nara period|Nara-period]] Japan is recognized more for important contributions in the art of [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] than painting.

The earliest surviving paintings from this period include the [[mural]]s on the interior walls of the {{nihongo|Kondō|金堂}} at the temple [[Hōryū-ji]] in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture]]. These mural paintings, as well as painted images on the important [[Tamamushi Shrine]] include narratives such as ''[[jataka]]'', episodes from the life of [[Gautama Buddha|the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni]], in addition to iconic images of buddhas, [[bodhisattvas]], and various minor deities. The style is reminiscent of [[Chinese painting]] from the [[Sui dynasty]] or the late [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period. However, by the mid-Nara period, paintings in the style of the [[Tang dynasty]] became very popular. These also include the wall murals in the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]], dating from around 700 AD. This style evolved into the ([[Kara-e]]) genre, which remained popular through the early [[Heian period]].

As most of the paintings in the Nara period are religious in nature, the vast majority are by anonymous artists. A large collection of Nara period art, Japanese as well as from the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp/shosoinPublic/doc/about_treasure.html |title=The Imperial Household Agency "About the Shosoin" |publisher=Shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523145410/http://shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp/shosoinPublic/doc/about_treasure.html |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is preserved at the [[Shōsō-in]], an 8th-century repository formerly owned by [[Tōdai-ji]] and currently administered by the [[Imperial Household Agency]].

===Heian period (794–1185)===
With the development of the Esoteric [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects of [[Shingon]] and [[Tendai]], painting of the 8th and 9th centuries is characterized by religious imagery, most notably painted {{nihongo|[[Mandala]]|曼荼羅|mandara}}. Numerous versions of mandala, most famously the ''[[Diamond Realm]] Mandala'' and ''[[Womb Realm]] Mandala'' at Tōji in Kyoto, were created as [[hanging scrolls]], and also as [[mural]]s on the walls of temples. A noted early example is at the five-story [[pagoda]] of [[Daigo-ji]], a temple south of [[Kyoto]].

With the rising importance of [[Pure Land]] sects of [[Japanese Buddhism]] in the 10th century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include {{nihongo|[[raigō]]zu|来迎図}}, which depict [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha along with attendant bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto]]. This is also considered an early example of so-called {{nihongo|[[Yamato-e]]|大和絵|extra= "Japanese-style painting"}}, insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. ''Yamato-e'' is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

[[File:Genji emaki azumaya.jpg|thumb|Panel from ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' handscroll (detail)]]
[[File:Heiji no ran.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Sanjō Palace]]]]
The mid-Heian period is seen as the golden age of ''Yamato-e,'' which were initially used primarily for sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') and folding screens (''[[byōbu]]''). However, new painting formats also came to the fore, especially towards the end of the Heian period, including ''[[emakimono]]'', or long illustrated handscrolls. Varieties of ''emakimono'' encompass illustrated novels, such as the '' [[Genji Monogatari]] '', historical works, such as the '' [[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]] '', and religious works. In some cases, ''emaki'' artists employed pictorial narrative conventions that had been used in Buddhist art since ancient times, while at other times they devised new narrative modes that are believed to convey visually the emotional content of the underlying narrative. ''Genji Monogatari'' is organized into discreet episodes, whereas the more lively ''[[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]]'' uses a continuous narrative mode in order to emphasize the narrative's forward motion. These two ''emaki'' differ stylistically as well, with the rapid brush strokes and light coloring of ''Ban Dainagon'' contrasting starkly to the abstracted forms and vibrant mineral pigments of the ''Genji'' scrolls. The '' [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] '' is another famous example of this type of painting.

''E-maki'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[onna-e]]'' ("women's pictures") and ''[[otoko-e]]'' ("men's pictures") and  styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles. Although the terms seem to suggest the aesthetic preferences of each gender, historians of Japanese art have long debated the actual meaning of these terms, and they remain unclear. Perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the ''Tale of Genji'' handscroll, typically deals with court life and courtly romance while ''otoko-e'', often deal with historical or semi-legendary events, particularly battles.

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
These genres continued on through [[Kamakura period]] Japan. ''E-maki'' of various kinds continued to be produced; however, the Kamakura period was much more strongly characterized by the art of [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], rather than painting.

As most of the paintings in the Heian and Kamakura periods are religious in nature, the vast majority are by anonymous artists.

===Muromachi period (1333–1573)===
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - right hand screen.jpg|thumb|Right panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c. 1595]]
[[File:SesshuShuutouTou.jpg|thumb|Landscape by [[Sesshū Tōyō]]]]

During the 14th century, the development of the great [[Zen]] monasteries in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and [[Kyoto]] had a major impact on the visual arts. ''[[Suibokuga]],'' an austere monochrome style of ink painting introduced from the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty]] China largely replaced the polychrome scroll paintings of the previous period, although some polychrome portraiture remained – primary in the form of ''chinso'' paintings of Zen monks. Typical of such painting is the depiction by the priest-painter [[Kaō (painter)|Kaō]] of the legendary monk Kensu (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail.

''Catching a Catfish with a Gourd'' (located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto), by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]], marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the "new style" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome [[landscape painting]]s (山水画 ''[[Shan shui|sansuiga]]'') had found patronage by the ruling [[Ashikaga clan|Ashikaga]] family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. A further development of landscape painting was the poem picture scroll, known as [[shigajiku]].

The foremost artists of the [[Muromachi period]] are the priest-painters [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shūbun]] and [[Sesshū Tōyō|Sesshū]]. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]], created in the painting ''[[:File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|Reading in a Bamboo Grove]]'' (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. ''Landscape of the Four Seasons'' (''Sansui Chokan''; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the [[Kanō school]] and the [[Ami school]] ([[:ja:阿弥派]]) adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

Important artists in the Muromachi period Japan include:
* [[Mokkei]] (c. 1250)
* [[Mokuan Reien]] (died 1345)
* [[Kaō (painter)|Kaō Ninga]] (e.14th century)
* [[Mincho (artist)|Mincho]] (1352–1431)
* [[Josetsu]] (1405–1423)
* [[Tenshō Shūbun]] (died 1460)
* [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506)
* [[Kanō Masanobu]] (1434–1530)
* [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559)

===Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–{{not a typo|1615}})===&lt;!-- in politics, Azuchi–Momoyama ends in 1603, but in art it ends in 1615 --&gt;
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|Screen detail depicting arrival of a Western ship, attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]] (1570–1616)]]
In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. The [[Kanō school]], patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers, gained tremendously in size and prestige. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]].

However, non-Kano school artists and currents existed and developed during the Azuchi–Momoyama period as well, adapting Chinese themes to Japanese materials and [[aesthetics]]. One important group was the [[Tosa school]], which developed primarily out of the ''yamato-e'' tradition, and which was known mostly for small scale works and illustrations of literary classics in book or ''emaki'' format.

Important artists in the Azuchi-Momoyama period include:
* [[Kanō Eitoku]] (1543–1590)
* [[Kanō Sanraku]] (1559–1663)
* [[Kanō Tan'yū]] (1602–1674)
* [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]] (1539–1610)
* [[Kaihō Yūshō]] (1533–1615)

===[[Edo period]] (1603–1868)===
[[File:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Scroll calligraphy of [[Bodhidharma]]&lt;!-- "Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become Buddha",--&gt; by Hakuin Ekaku (1685 to 1768)]]

Many art historians show the Edo period as a continuation of the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Certainly, during the early Edo period, many of the previous trends in painting continued to be popular; however, a number of new trends also emerged.

One very significant school which arose in the early Edo period was the [[Rinpa school]], which used classical themes, but presented them in a bold, and lavishly decorative format. Sōtatsu in particular evolved a decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. A century later, Korin reworked Sōtatsu's style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own.

Another important genre which began during Azuchi–Momoyama period, but which reached its full development during the early Edo period was ''[[Namban]]'' art, both in the depiction of exotic foreigners and in the use of the exotic foreigner style in painting. This genre was centered around the port of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], which after the start of the [[sakoku|national seclusion policy]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was the only Japanese port left open to foreign trade, and was thus the conduit by which Chinese and European artistic influences came to Japan. Paintings in this genre include [[Nanpin school|Nagasaki school]] paintings, and also the [[Shijō school|Maruyama-Shijo school]], which combine Chinese and Western influences with traditional Japanese elements.

A third important trend in the Edo period was the rise of the ''Bunjinga'' (literati painting) genre, also known as the [[Nanga (Japanese painting)|Nanga school]] (Southern Painting school). This genre started as an imitation of the works of Chinese scholar-amateur painters of the [[Yuan dynasty]], whose works and techniques came to Japan in the mid-18th century. Master Kuwayama Gyokushū was the greatest supporter of creating the ''bunjin'' style. He theorised that polychromatic landscapes were to be considered at the same level of monochromatic paintings by Chinese literati. Furthermore, he included some Japanese traditionalist artists, such as [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]] and [[Ogata Kōrin]] of the Rinpa group, among major Nanga representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Marco, Meccarelli. 2015.  [https://www.academia.edu/20410225/Chinese_Painters_in_Nagasaki_Style_and_Artistic_Contaminatio_during_the_Tokugawa_Period_1603-1868_ "Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603–1868)"] Ming Qing Studies 2015, Pages 175–236.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later ''bunjinga'' artists considerably modified both the techniques and the subject matter of this genre to create a blending of Japanese and Chinese styles. The exemplars of this style are [[Ike no Taiga]], [[Uragami Gyokudō]], [[Yosa Buson]], [[Tanomura Chikuden]], [[Tani Bunchō]], and [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]].

Due to the Tokugawa shogunate's policies of fiscal and social austerity, the luxurious modes of these genre and styles were largely limited to the upper strata of society, and were unavailable, if not actually forbidden to the lower classes. The common people developed a separate type of art, the ''[[fūzokuga]],'' (風俗画, [[Genre art]]) in which painting depicting scenes from common, everyday life, especially that of the common people, ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre, prostitutes and landscapes were popular. These paintings in the 16th century gave rise to the paintings and woodcut prints of [[ukiyo-e]].

Important artists in the Edo period include:
* [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]] (died 1643)
* [[Tosa Mitsuoki]] (1617–1691)
* [[Ogata Kōrin]] (1658–1716)
* [[Gion Nankai]] (1677–1751)
* [[Sakaki Hyakusen]] (1697–1752)
* [[Yanagisawa Kien]] (1704–1758)
* [[Yosa Buson]] (1716–1783)
* [[Itō Jakuchū]] (1716–1800)
* [[Ike no Taiga]] (1723–1776)
* [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (c. 1725–1770)
* [[Soga Shōhaku]] (1730–1781)
* [[Maruyama Ōkyo]] (1733–1795)
* [[Okada Beisanjin]] (1744–1820)
* [[Uragami Gyokudō]] (1745–1820)
* [[Matsumura Goshun]] (1752–1811)
* [[Katsushika Hokusai]] (1760–1849)
* [[Tani Bunchō]] (1763–1840)
* [[Tanomura Chikuden]] (1777–1835)
* [[Okada Hankō]] (1782–1846)
* [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]] (1783–1856)
* [[Watanabe Kazan]] (1793–1841)
* [[Utagawa Hiroshige]] (1797–1858)
* [[Shibata Zeshin]] (1807–1891)
* [[Tomioka Tessai]] (1836–1924)
* [[Kumashiro Hi]] (Yūhi) (c. 1712–1772)

===[[Empire of Japan|Prewar period]] (1868–1945)===
[[File:Kuroda-seiki-kohan00-6-1b.jpeg|thumb|[[Kuroda Seiki]], ''Lakeside'', 1897, oil on canvas, [[Kuroda Memorial Hall]], [[Tokyo]]]]
[[File:Yoritomo in a cave.jpg|thumb|''Yoritomo in a Cave'' by [[Maeda Seison]]]]

The prewar period was marked by the division of art into competing European styles and traditional indigenous styles.

During the [[Meiji period]], Japan underwent a tremendous political and social change in the course of the [[Europeanization]] and modernization campaign organized by the [[Meiji government]]. Western-style painting (''[[yōga]]'') was officially promoted by the government, who sent promising young artists abroad for studies, and who hired [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|foreign artists]] to come to Japan to establish an art curriculum at Japanese schools.

However, after an initial burst of enthusiasm for western style art, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and led by [[art critic]] [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and educator [[Ernest Fenollosa]], there was a revival of appreciation for traditional Japanese styles ([[Nihonga]]). In the 1880s, western style art was banned from official exhibitions and was severely criticized by critics. Supported by Okakura and Fenollosa, the ''Nihonga'' style evolved with influences from the European [[pre-Raphaelite]] movement and European [[romanticism]].

The Yōga style painters formed the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) to hold its own exhibitions and to promote a renewed interest in western art.

In 1907, with the establishment of the'' [[Bunten]]'' under the aegis of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], both competing groups found mutual recognition and co-existence, and even began the process towards mutual synthesis.

The [[Taishō period]] saw the predominance of ''Yōga'' over ''Nihonga''. After long stays in Europe, many artists (including Arishima Ikuma) returned to Japan under the reign of Yoshihito, bringing with them the techniques of [[impressionism]] and early [[Post-Impressionism]]. The works of [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] influenced early Taishō period paintings. However, ''yōga'' artists in the Taishō period also tended towards [[eclecticism]], and there was a profusion of dissident artistic movements. These included the Fusain Society (''Fyuzankai'') which emphasized styles of post-impressionism, especially [[fauvism]]. In 1914, the ''Nikakai'' (Second Division Society) emerged to oppose the government-sponsored Bunten Exhibition.

Japanese painting during the Taishō period was only mildly influenced by other contemporary European movements, such as [[neoclassicism]] and late post-impressionism.

However, it was resurgent ''Nihonga'', towards mid-1920s, which adopted certain trends from post-impressionism. The second generation of ''Nihonga'' artists formed the [[Japan Fine Arts Academy]] (''Nihon Bijutsuin'') to compete against the government-sponsored ''Bunten'', and although ''yamato-e'' traditions remained strong, the increasing use of western [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and western concepts of space and light began to blur the distinction between ''Nihonga'' and ''yōga''.

Japanese painting in the prewar [[Shōwa period]] was largely dominated by [[Sōtarō Yasui]] and [[Ryūzaburō Umehara]], who introduced the concepts of [[pure art]] and [[abstract painting]] to the ''Nihonga'' tradition, and thus created a more interpretative version of that genre. This trend was further developed by Leonard Foujita and the Nika Society, to encompass [[surrealism]]. To promote these trends, the Independent Art Association (''Dokuritsu Bijutsu Kyokai'') was formed in 1931.

During the [[World War II]], government controls and [[censorship]] meant that only patriotic themes could be expressed. Many artists were recruited into the government [[propaganda]] effort, and critical non-emotional review of their works is only just beginning.

Important artists in the prewar period include:

===Postwar period (1945–present)===
In the postwar period, the government-sponsored [[Japan Art Academy]] (''Nihon Geijutsuin'') was formed in 1947, containing both ''nihonga'' and ''yōga'' divisions. Government sponsorship of art exhibitions has ended, but has been replaced by private exhibitions, such as the ''Nitten'', on an even larger scale. Although the ''Nitten'' was initially the exhibition of the Japan Art Academy, since 1958 it has been run by a separate private corporation. Participation in the ''Nitten'' has become almost a prerequisite for nomination to the Japan Art Academy, which in itself is almost an unofficial prerequisite for nomination to the [[Order of Culture]].

The arts of the [[Edo period|Edo]] and [[Empire of Japan|prewar]] periods (1603–1945) was supported by [[merchant]]s and urban people. Counter to the Edo and prewar periods, arts of the postwar period became popular. After [[World War II]], painters, [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and [[printmaker]]s flourished in the big cities, particularly [[Tokyo]], and became preoccupied with the mechanisms of urban life, reflected in the flickering lights, [[neon]] colors, and frenetic pace of their abstractions. All the "isms" of the New York-Paris art world were fervently embraced. After the abstractions of the 1960s, the 1970s saw a return to realism strongly flavored by the "op" and "pop" art movements, embodied in the 1980s in the explosive works of [[Ushio Shinohara]]. Many such outstanding avant-garde artists worked both in Japan and abroad, winning international prizes. These artists felt that there was "nothing Japanese" about their works, and indeed they belonged to the international school. By the late 1970s, the search for Japanese qualities and a national style caused many artists to reevaluate their artistic ideology and turn away from what some felt were the empty formulas of the West. Contemporary paintings within the modern idiom began to make conscious use of traditional Japanese art forms, devices, and ideologies. A number of ''[[mono-ha]]'' artists turned to painting to recapture traditional nuances in spatial arrangements, color harmonies, and lyricism.

Japanese-style or ''[[nihonga]]'' painting continues in a prewar fashion, updating traditional expressions while retaining their intrinsic character. Some artists within this style still paint on [[silk]] or paper with traditional colors and ink, while others used new materials, such as [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]].

Many of the older schools of art, most notably those of the Edo and prewar periods, were still practiced. For example, the decorative naturalism of the ''rimpa'' school, characterized by brilliant, pure colors and bleeding washes, was reflected in the work of many artists of the postwar period in the 1980s art of [[Hikosaka Naoyoshi]]. The realism of [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]'s [[Maruyama school|school]] and the calligraphic and spontaneous Japanese style of the gentlemen-scholars were both widely practiced in the 1980s. Sometimes all of these schools, as well as older ones, such as the [[Kanō school]] ink traditions, were drawn on by contemporary artists in the Japanese style and in the modern idiom. Many Japanese-style painters were honored with awards and prizes as a result of renewed popular demand for Japanese-style art beginning in the 1970s. More and more, the international modern painters also drew on the Japanese schools as they turned away from Western styles in the 1980s. The tendency had been to synthesize East and West. Some artists had already leapt the gap between the two, as did the outstanding painter [[Shinoda Toko]]. Her bold sumi ink abstractions were inspired by traditional calligraphy but realized as lyrical expressions of modern abstraction.

There are also a number of contemporary painters in Japan whose work is largely inspired by [[anime]] sub-cultures and other aspects of popular and youth culture. [[Takashi Murakami]] is perhaps among the most famous and popular of these, along with and the other artists in his [[Kaikai Kiki]] studio collective. His work centers on expressing issues and concerns of postwar Japanese society through what are usually seemingly innocuous forms. He draws heavily from anime and related styles, but produces paintings and sculptures in media more traditionally associated with fine arts, intentionally blurring the lines between commercial and popular art and fine arts.

Important artists in the postwar period include:
* [[Ogura Yuki]] (1895–2000)
* [[Uemura Shōko]] (1902–2001)
* [[Ryōhei Koiso|Koiso Ryōhei]] (1903–1988)
* [[Kaii Higashiyama]] (1908–1999)

'''Kadist''' is an interdisciplinary contemporary arts organization with an international contemporary art collection. In addition to being a collecting body, Kadist hosts artists residencies and produces exhibitions, publications, and public events. The first location was opened in Paris in 2006 by Vincent Worms and Sandra Terdjman, and a San Francisco, California location was added in 2011 in the Mission District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Del Pesco|first=Joseph|title=about page|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kadist-Art-Foundation/105972509425490?id=105972509425490&amp;sk=info|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

* '''Exhibitions''': With a gallery space both in Paris and San Francisco, Kadist hosts exhibitions by international artists and curators, often in coordination with their residency program. Artists they have worked with include [[Ryan Gander]], [[Danh Vo]], [[Francis Alÿs]], and Roman Ondàk. Additionally they have co-produced large scale artist projects, including "Klau Mich" by [[Dora García]] and "Muster" by [[Clemens von Wedemeyer]] at [[DOCUMENTA (13)]].
* '''Residencies''': Kadist provides residencies for a wide range of creative activities including and not limited to new artistic productions, publications, writers and curators. Recent residents include artists [[Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries]], bookstore Ooga Booga and publications [[White Fungus (magazine)|White Fungus]], Nero, and [[Fillip]].
* '''Events''': Kadist San Francisco hosts an ongoing series of events,frequently on Wednesdays, which have involved screenings, performances, conversations, and game shows.

==Mission==

From their mission statement: "We believe contemporary artists make an important contribution to a progressive society, their work often addressing key issues of our time. KADIST is a non-profit organization that encourages this engagement and is dedicated to extending the reach of artists represented in its collection to a global audience, thus facilitating new connections across cultures. Its programs develop collaborations with artists, curators and many art organizations around the world. Local programs in KADIST’s hubs of Paris and San Francisco include exhibitions, public events, residencies and educational initiatives. Complemented by an  active online network, they aim at creating vibrant conversations about contemporary art and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worms|first=Vincent|title=mission|url=http://kadist.org/about/|publisher=kadist . org|accessdate=29 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

The Kadist collection was established in 2001 and includes film and video, performance, painting, photography, drawings and prints, sculpture, and installations. Ultimately the collection not bound by geography, but it focuses on four greater regions: the Middle East, Asia, The Americas and Europe. Kadist has also supported the production of artworks, and commissioned artworks through its residency program, and in collaboration with international biennials—some of which are part of the collection.

{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}
This is a '''list of media''' from the Japanese [[science fiction]] series '''''[[RahXephon]]'''''.

''RahXephon'' began production as an [[anime]] [[television series]] in 2001. A [[manga]] version, a [[novelization]], [[soundtrack]]s and an [[audio drama]] were published during and after the original broadcast, which lasted from January to September 2002. The series was released on [[DVD]] in Japan during its original broadcast, and was subsequently translated and both broadcast and released on DVD in other countries.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;A television movie, a ''RahXephon'' video game, and an [[Original video animation|OVA]] episode were released a year later, in 2003. Characters, mecha and story from ''RahXephon'' were featured in a game in the ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' series. Art books, guide books and additional novels were also released. &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;This list includes video games and music, but not toys, hobby articles and other merchandise.

==Video games==
===RahXephon video game===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[RahXephon]]--&gt;
[[File:Ps2rahxephon.jpg|thumb|''RahXephon'' for PS2, regular edition cover]]
The ''RahXephon'' video game, {{nihongo|''Blue Sky [[Fantasia (music)|Fantasia]]''{{efn|name=unofftrans}}|''ラーゼフォン 蒼穹幻想曲''|''Rāzefon Soukyū Gensokyoku''}}, was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] by [[Bandai|Bandai Japan]] on 7 August 2003; there is no English version. The game is mainly an [[adventure game]] with some [[Action game|action]] sequences. The player moves around in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, learning about places and relationships, and moving the story toward one of forty different endings. In-game characters are voiced by their original Japanese [[Seiyū|voice actors]] and are animated while speaking. [[Cut scene]]s feature [[hand-drawn animation]], some of which was made for the game. In the action sequences the player fights Dolems with the RahXephon; weapons and other RahXephon variants can be un-locked.

The special ''Plusculus'' edition of the video game contains an extra booklet and a DVD with the [[#Other anime|''RahXephon'' OVA episode]].

===Super Robot Wars===
The ''RahXephon'' characters and mecha have appeared in the game ''[[Super Robot Wars MX]]'' (2004), mixed with those from other shows. ''RahXephon'''s story-line also had a major role in the game's overall mixed plot, as the series' climax was also the climax of the game. In the game, the RahXephon is a very powerful unit, with the power of a Super Robot but much of the agility of a Real Robot; although not quite as overwhelming as the [[Zeorymer]], it is one of the more effective units.

''RahXephon'' characters and mecha re-appear in the game ''Super Robot Wars Scramble Commander the 2nd'' (2007).

This is a list of the '''highest known prices paid for paintings'''. The current record price is approximately [[United States dollar|$]]450 million paid for [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|''Salvator Mundi'']] in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Lost' Leonardo da Vinci to go on display, says National Gallery|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8632230/Lost-Leonardo-da-Vinci-to-go-on-display-says-National-Gallery.html|publisher=Telegraph|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Gallery Exhibition Catalogue|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/media/15705/exhibition-guide_leonardo-da-vinci.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The most famous paintings, especially [[old master]] works done before 1803, are generally owned or held at [[museum]]s, for viewing by patrons. Since the museums rarely sell them they are considered priceless. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' as having the highest ever [[insurance]] value for a painting. On permanent display at the [[Louvre]] in Paris, the ''Mona Lisa'' was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962. Taking [[inflation]] into account, the 1962 value would be around US${{Inflation|US|100|1962|r=-1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The earliest sale on the list below (''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]]) is from March 1987; with a price of £24.75 million (£{{Inflation|UK|24.75|1987|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). This sale tripled the previous record, and introduced a new era in top art sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was £8.1 million (£{{Inflation|US|8.1|1985|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) paid by the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] for [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' at [[Christie's]] in London on April 18, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;William Wilson, [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/entertainment/ca-15137_1_mantegna-paintings Getty Pays $10.5 Million For Painting], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 19, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[constant dollars]], the highest price paid before 1987 was by the [[National Gallery of Art]] when in February 1967 they acquired [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' for around $5 million (${{Inflation|US|5|1967}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) from the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]]. The sale of Van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'' was the first time a "modern" (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder, as opposed to the [[old master painting]]s which previously had dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875 paintings among the listed top 89, and none created between 1635 and 1874.

An exceptional case is graffiti artist [[David Choe]], who accepted payment in [[share (finance)|shares]] for painting graffiti art in the headquarters of a fledgling [[Facebook]]. His shares were of limited value when he was given them, but by the time of Facebook's [[IPO]] they were valued at around $200m.&lt;ref name="NYT Facebook"&gt;Nick Bilton, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/technology/for-founders-to-decorators-facebook-riches.html?_r=2 For Founders to Decorators, Facebook Riches]," ''The New York Times'', 1/1/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Van Gogh, Picasso, and Warhol ==
[[File:Red vineyards.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[The Red Vineyard]]'' (1888), the only painting [[Vincent van Gogh]] sold during his lifetime]]
[[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Andy Warhol]] are by far the best-represented artists in the list. Whereas Picasso and Warhol became wealthy men, Van Gogh is known to have sold only one painting in his lifetime, ''[[The Red Vineyard]]'', for 400 francs (approximately $2,000 in 2018 dollars) to the impressionist painter and heiress [[Anna Boch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annaboch.com/theredvineyard/|title=The Red Vineyard Painting at annaboch.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices realised for just his nine paintings listed below, when adjusted for inflation to 2017, add up to over $900&amp;nbsp;million.

== Most expensive painting by a female artist ==
[[Georgia O'Keeffe]] holds the record for the highest price paid for a painting by a woman. On 20 November 2014 at Sotheby's, the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] bought her 1932 painting ''Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1'' for $44.4 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|44.405|2014|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/most-expensive-female-artists-at-auction-2016-500096|title=The Most Expensive Female Artists 2016 - artnet News|date=2016-05-24|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2014/american-art-n09229.html|title=American Art Auction Results|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of highest prices paid &lt;!-- at auctions or private sales (inflation adjusted) --&gt;==
This list is ordered by [[consumer price index]] inflation-adjusted value (in bold) in millions of [[United States dollar]]s in {{Inflation-year|US}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Wikipedia template uses a yearly average inflation. Using monthly averages gives slightly different numbers, most significantly for paintings sold early or late in a year with significant inflation.&lt;/ref&gt; Where necessary, the price is first converted to dollars using the [[exchange rate]] at the time the painting was sold. The inflation adjustment may change as recent inflation rates are often revised. A list in another currency may be in a slightly different order due to exchange-rate fluctuations. Paintings are listed only once, i.e. for the highest price sold.

At the same time, Bouvier was negotiating and eventually succeeded to buy the painting for $112 million from Ursula Ucicky, widow of [[Gustav Ucicky]] (the illegitimate son of Gustav Klimt and one of his models). Ucicky shared half with the heirs of the Jewish family from whom the painting had been seized in 1939.

[[File:Salon de la princesse hotel de soubise.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oval salon of the [[Hôtel de Soubise]] (now Archives Nationale), Paris (1735-40)]]
The '''Louis XV style''' or '''''Louis Quinze''''' is a style of architecture and decorative arts which appeared during the reign of [[Louis XV of France]]. From 1710 until about 1730, the period known as the Regency, it was largely an extension of the "[[Style Louis XIV]]" of his great-grandfather and predecessor, [[Louis XIV of France]]. From about 1730 until about 1750, it became more original, decorative and exuberant, in what was known as the ''[[rocaille]]'' style, under the influence of the King's mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour]].  It marked the beginning of the European [[Rococo]] movement.  From 1750 until the King's death in 1774, it became more sober, ordered, and began to show the influences of [[neoclassicism]].

==Architecture==
The chief architect of the King was [[Jacques Gabriel]] from 1734 until 1742, and then his more famous son, [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], until the end of the reign. His major works included the [[Ecole Militaire]], the ensemble of buildings overlooking the Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]]; 1761-1770), and the [[Petit Trianon]] at Versailles (1764).  Over the course of the reign of Louis XV, while interiors were lavishly decorated, the facades gradually became simpler, less ornamented and more classical. The facades designed by Gabriel were carefully rhymed and balanced by rows of windows and columns, and, on large buildings like the Place de la Concorde, often featured grand arcades on the street level, and classical pediments or balustrades on the roofline. Ornamental features sometimes included curving wrought-iron balconies with undulating rocaille designs, similar to the rocaille decoration of the interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious architecture of the period was also sober and monumental, and it tended, at the end of the reign, toward the neoclassical. Major examples include the Church of Saint-Genevieve (now the [[Panthéon]]), built from 1758 to 1790 to a design by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]], and the Church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-1777) by [[Jean Chalgrin]], which featured an enomrous barrel-vaulted nave.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Interior decoration==

Interior decoration during the reign of Louis XV fell into two periods;  the first especially featured [[rocaille]] ornament, sculpted sinuous curves and counter-curves, often in floral and vegetative patterns, applied to the panels of the walls, often with medallions in the center.  The panels large mirrors were framed in often framed with sculpted palm leaves or other floral decoration. Unlike the rococo style, the ornament was usually restrained, symmetrical and balanced. In the early period of the style, the designs were often inspired by French versions of Chinese art, animals, especially monkeys (''[[Singerie]]'') and arabesques, or themes taken from works of the artists of the period, including [[Jean Bérain the Younger]], [[Watteau]] and [[Jean Audran]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1750, in reaction to the excesses of the earlier style, the designs and moldings on the interior walls were white or pale colored, more geometric, decorated with sculpted garlands, roses, and crowns, and ornamented with designs inspired by ancient Greece and Rome. This style was found in the ''Salon de Compagnie'' at the [[Petit Trianon]], and it was the predecessor of the [[Louis XVI style]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 142-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture==
{{Main|Louis XV furniture}}
The chairs of the Louis XV style, compared with those of Louis XIV,  were characterized by lightness, comfort and harmony of lines. The traverse support of the legs disappeared, and the chairs were designed so one could sit back comfortably. The legs had a curving 'S shape. The carved decor featured sculpted fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage. The ''dossier'', or back of the chair, was ''violones'', slightly curved like a violin.  Several new variants of chairs appeared including the ''bergere'', with stuffed upholstered arms, ''A confessional'', with upholstered and padded arms; the ''Marquise'', a ''bergere'' seating two persons, with a low back, and short arms.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Console table]] was a table designed to be placed against a wall, usually used for displaying art objects;  it was almost always in the rocaille style, with undulating curves, modeled after seashells and foliage. very sinuous, twisting rocaille modeled after seashells and foliage.

The [[Commode]] was a new type of furniture which had first appeared late in the reign of Louis XIV.  It was a chest drawers resting on four S-shaped legs.  It usually featured gilded bronze ornament, but during the reign of Louis XV, it was also covered with plaques of exotic woods of different colors in geometric patterns or floral shapes.  A particular variation, called the ''façon de Chine'' or "Chinese fashion"  emerged, which contrasted the gilded bronze against black lacquered wood. A large number of skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'' from around Europe were employed to fine wood Commodes and other furniture for the King.  They included [[Jean-François Oeben]], [[Roger Vandercruse Lacroix]], [[Gilles Joubert]], [[Antoine Gaudreau]], and [[Martin Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of other new types of furniture appeared, including the ''chiffonier'', a cabinet with five drawers, and the ''table de toilette'', a kind of desk-table with three shutters, the central one having a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the reign of Louis XV, between 1755 and 1760, tastes in furniture began to change. The ''rocaille'' designs began more discreet and restrained, and the influence of antiquity and neo-classicism began to appear in new designs of furniture.  The Commodes became to have more geometric forms;  the decoration turned from rocaille to geometric forms, garlands of oak leaves, flowers and classical motifs. A new type of tall cabinet, the ''Cartonnier'', made its appearance between 1760 and 1765.  It took its inspiration from Greek mythology and architecture, with friezes, vaulting, sculpted trophies, bronze lion heads,  and other classic, elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

The dominant subjects of painting in the early reign of Louis XV were mythology and history, the same as those of Louis XV.  Later in the reign, when Louis began to construct new apartments within the palaces of Versailles and Fontanebleau, his tastes turned more to pastoral scenes and genre painting. [[Madame de Pompadour]], the king's mistress, was also one of the major patrons of the artists of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most favored artist of the King was [[François Boucher]],  He produced for the King art of every description; religious paintings, genre scenes, landscapes, pastorals, and exotic scenes, frequently featuring gatherings of cheerful and seductive nudes. As the king's other great passion was hunting, he painted ''Leopard hunt'' (1765) and ''Crocodile hunt'' (1767) for the King's new apartments at Versailles. In 1767, near the end of the career, he was named First Painter of the King.&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008) pg.76&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable painters included [[Jean Baptiste Oudry]], whose hunting scenes decorated royal apartments in Versailles, and were made into tapestries and popular engravings; the portrait artists [[Maurice Quentin de la Tour]] and [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], who made portraits for the royal family and aristocracy; and the genre painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008) pg.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Sculpture==
The sculptural styles of the ''Grand Siécle'' of Louis XIV continued to dominate during most of the reign of Louis XV.  Madame de Pompadour was a particularly enthusiastic patroness of sculpture, and many busts and statues were made of her or commissioned by her.  The most prominent sculptors of the early period were the [[Guillaume Coustou the Younger]] and his brother, [[Guillaume Coustou the Elder]], [[Robert Le Lorrain]], and [[Edmé Bouchardon]].  Bouchardon created the equestrian statue of Louis XV for the center of the new Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]]) which was modeled after that of Louis XIV in the Place Louis le Grand (now [[Place Vendôme]]) by [[François Girardon]].  After the death of Bouchardon, the statue was finished by another major monumentalist of the period, [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]]. In the later part of the reign of Louis XV, sculptors began to give greater attention to the faces; the leaders of this new style were [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] noted for his busts of celebrated authors and statesmen, and [[Augustin Pajou]], who made notable portrait busts of the natural scientist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Madame du Barry]].  Sculpture began to reach a larger popular audience during this period, thanks to reproductions made from terra cotta and unglazed porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Guéganic (2008) page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Urbanism: monumental squares and fountains==

In the later years of his reign, Louis constructed a major new square in the center of the city, Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]], with a harmonious row of new buildings, designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]. He built other monumental squares in the centers of [[Rennes]] and [[Bordeaux]].  He also constructed one monumental fountain in Paris, the [[Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons]], with statuary by [[Edmé Bouchardon]]; but it was poorly sited on a narrow street, and while it had an abundance of sculpture, because of the antiquated water supply of Paris, it produced very little water. The fountain was criticized by [[Voltaire]] in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, while it was still under construction:

{{quote|I have no doubt that Bouchardon will make of this fountain a fine piece of architecture;  but what kind of fountain has only two faucets where the water porters will come to fill their buckets?  This isn't the way fountains are built in Rome to beautify the city.  We need to lift ourselves out of taste that is gross and shabby. Fountains should be built in public places, and viewed from all the gates.  There isn't a single public place in the vast [[faubourg Saint-Germain]]; that makes my blood boil. Paris is like [[Daniel 2|the statue of Nabuchodonosor]], partly made of gold and partly made of muck.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Voltaire to Caylus, extract published in A. Roserot (1902), cited in ''Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance à nos jours'', from the Collection ''Paris et son Patrimoine'', directed by Béatrice de Andia, Délégué Général à l'Action artistique de la Ville de Paris, 1998. collection of texts on the history of Paris fountains.)Translation by D.R Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It depicts a series of compositions, "M-mination" from a woman with [[Albinism]], deemed a "Madwoman" by society because of her depth of understanding and unconditional Self Acceptance.  This art piece is presented in an interactive multimedia installation of space, UV light, 5.1 surround sound, items, images and concepts. This installation includes a one-woman live performance by Mem Nahadr, and stands as a sculptured interactive artpiece otherwise. 

Supported by a team of artists and technicians, this presentation includes a multimedia system created by [[James P. Nichols]], Broadway, Jazz and Grammy Award Winning Producer/Engineer; as well as Creative - Stage Direction by Claude E. Sloan, Jr., of the LOEB Drama Center Experimental Theater at Harvard, and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Public Theater.

Album cover for the opera was photographed by the famed fashion photographer and Human Rights organizational founder, Rick Guidotti of Positive Exposure.

An excerpt from the ''Madwoman'' opera was performed before [[Queen Beatrix]] of Holland during the 25th annual [[Veerstichting]] Symposium at the St. Pieterskerk church in Lieden, The Netherlands.

==Early life==

Hebden was born in [[Chester]] before his family moved to [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]], three weeks later.&lt;ref name="lancashire"&gt;[http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/archive/1998/03/04/6158919.I_see_Pendle_and_I_m_home/ ''I see Pendle and I'm home''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232618/http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/archive/1998/03/04/6158919.I_see_Pendle_and_I_m_home/ |date=6 November 2014 }}, [[Lancashire Evening Telegraph]], 4 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at West Gate High School and began his career as a window dresser in [[Burnley]].&lt;ref name="lancashire"/&gt;
He was involved in [[amateur dramatics]] groups, one of which included [[Richard Moore (actor)|Richard Moore]], called ''The Highcliffe Players''.&lt;ref name=LT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/whats_on/8096790.Preview__Comedians_in_Bolton/ |title=Preview: Comedians in Bolton |date=13 April 2010 |work=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When aged 28, he attended the [[Rose Bruford College|Rose Bruford Drama School]] in London&lt;ref name="lancashire"/&gt; before beginning a career in theatre.

He first appeared as [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] in 1994, a character he based on Whitworth based Michael Bunnell for his sheer nosiness and ability to get involved in other people’s business; he left in 1997, before returning to the role in December 1999 for his current stint in the show.

'''Michael David Bishop, Baron Glendonbrook''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 10 February 1942) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] businessman and [[life peer]] who rose to prominence as owner of the airline [[BMI (airline)|BMI]]. He sold his stake in the airline to [[Lufthansa]] on 1 July 2009 and has an estimated personal fortune of £280&amp;nbsp;[[million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3762149.ece |title=Sir Michael Bishop |author=[[Sunday Times Rich List]] |date=27 April 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |work=The Times |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the country's first executives.&lt;ref name="Businesses '"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8202485.stm |title=Businesses |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Michael Bishop was born in [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]], [[Cheshire]]. The son of a factory boss, aged six he was given a pleasure flight, and in 1949 his parents took him on an [[Aer Lingus]] flight to [[Dublin]] in search of [[chocolate]], a rarity in the post-war [[rationing]] in Manchester.&lt;ref name="Guard1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/may/18/theairlineindustry |title=A generation game |work=The Guardian |date=18 May 2002 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at the independent [[Mill Hill School]] in north [[London]], he enjoyed flying and as a result took a series of school holiday jobs with an [[Aerial photography|aerial photographer]].&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt;

==British Midland==
In 1963, Bishop joined the [[ground handling]] operation of Manchester-based Mercury Airlines, a schedule and charter airline, which was taken over by [[BMI (airline)|British Midland Airways]] (later re-branded as BMI) in October 1964. Bishop joined British Midland, and rose to become General Manager of the airline in 1969 and Managing Director in 1972.

In 1978, the London-based Minster Assets investment group, which owned British Midland, decided to sell its stake. With the help of an entrepreneurial [[California]]n [[dentist]], Bishop raised £2.5&amp;nbsp;million to lead the [[management buy-out]], and was subsequently appointed chairman: "I had to borrow the money from an American citizen. Most venture capitalists want a return of 40% to make up for all their other failures, and they want an exit strategy."&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt; From 1969 he was the key driving force behind the steady growth of the airline, which held eleven percent of the landing and take-off slots at [[London Heathrow]] airport, second only to [[British Airways]],&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; with a route network spanning Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.

Bishop formerly held a controlling 50% + 1 share stake of BMI, with [[Germany|German]] airline [[Lufthansa]] holding 30% minus 1 share, and [[SAS Group|SAS Airlines]] a further 20%. In October 2008, under a deal agreed in 1999 as part of the package for BMI to join the [[Star Alliance]],&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; Bishop agreed to sell his 50% stake to Lufthansa for an undisclosed sum, though reports suggested it was about £318m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7697261.stm |title=BMI being taken over by Lufthansa |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; BDLH (LH's holding vehicle) acquired Bishop's share on 1 July 2009, assuming full control of the company.

==Honours and appointments==
Between 1991 and 1993, Bishop was deputy chairman of [[Channel 4]] television, becoming chairman from 1993 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/sir-michael-bishop-quiet-man-of-bmi-has-fullthrottle-air-rage-562630.html |title=Sir Michael Bishop: Quiet man of BMI has full-throttle air rage |work=The Independent|date=9 May 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a board member at [[Nigel Rudd|Sir Nigel Rudd's]] Williams plc., and deputy chairman at [[Airtours]].&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5061705.ece |title=Lufthansa roars into Heathrow |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=O'Connell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50551 |date=14 June 1986 |page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1991 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52858 |date=10 March 1992 |page=4257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from the [[University of Leicester]] on 12 July 2007.

In an annual survey by [[The Independent]] of the UK's most influential gay men and women, Bishop was ranked as number 5 in 2005 and number 6 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |title=Gay Power: The pink list |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107115957/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |archivedate=7 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2011, Bishop was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Glendonbrook''', of [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]] in the County of [[Cheshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59690 |date=4 February 2011 |page=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Times |title=Baronies |date=4 February 2011 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] in the [[House of Lords]] on 22 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/minutes/110323/ldordpap.htm#minproc House of Lords Minute of Proceedings for 22 March 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; where he sits as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]

==Personal life==
Bishop is openly [[homosexual|gay]] and, since 2008, has spoken out publicly about gay rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-revolution-in-the-boardroom-why-it-pays-to-be-gay-901851.html |title=A revolution in the boardroom |work=The Independent |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |location=London |first=Jerome |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Businesses 'retain gay prejudice'"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8202485.stm |title=Businesses 'retain gay prejudice' |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop is often referred to as "dapper" by the press to note his keen sense of elegance. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] since the age of 17, he is chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]—which performs the operas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]—due to his personal financial sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000726/ai_n14336239/pg_2?tag=artBody;col1 |title=Twenty Questions: Sir Michael Bishop, owner and chairman of British |publisher=The Independent |date=26 July 2000 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804233504/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000726/ai_n14336239/pg_2?tag=artBody;col1 |archivedate=4 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; Bishop lives in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.192.com/ |title=– Search for Michael David Bishop in London |publisher=192.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Bruern Abbey]], West Oxfordshire, having purchased the 18th-century property in 2013.

'''''Ninety from the Nineties: A Decade of Printing''''' was an exhibition held at the [[New York Public Library]] from November 7, 2003 through May 28, 2004.

''Ninety from the Nineties'' showcased a selection of ninety books made in the 1990s that were chosen on the merit of book arts. Note that the books were not necessarily written in the 1990s; some were older texts that were used to make special books in the 1990s. And, the books were not selected on literary merit.

In a contemporary review, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the concept of the selection like this: "books, which we are accustomed to thinking of as containers — and conveyers — of information, are placed in a context in which form is valued over content. Language is less important than the type that impresses it on the page. The paper counts for more than the story told on it. The illustrations and the binding might be the story."

The books were divided into five categories: [[Bookbinding|binding]], paper, [[typography|type]], [[illustration]] and "inspiration." The exhibition was curated by Virginia Bartow.

==Books in the exhibition==

'''''Partonopeus de Blois''''' is a long poem in the [[chivalric romance]] genre written in [[Old French]] in the 1170s or 1180s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/partonopeus/generalintroduction.htm Introduction to ''Partonopeus de Blois''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003452/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/partonopeus/generalintroduction.htm |date=2015-05-05 }} at Humanities Research Institute at University of Sheffield (website also has the full text of the poem). Concerning the dating of the poem: "One view is that it was first written around 1170, while another is that it dates from the mid 1180s. This question of dating is bound up with another, namely whether ''Partonopeus'' influenced the work of the most famous writer of Old French romance, Chrétien de Troyes, or the other way around." In either case, it is widely accepted nowadays that the poem was completed at or before 1188.&lt;/ref&gt; Its author is unknown (possibly [[Denis Pyramus]] was the author).

==Plot==

Partenopeus is represented as having lived in the days of [[Clovis I|Clovis, king of France]]. He is seized while hunting in the [[Ardennes]], and carried off to a mysterious castle with invisible inhabitants. Melior, empress of [[Constantinople]], comes to him at night, stipulating that he must not attempt to see her for two and a half years. After successfully fighting against the Saracens, led by Sornegur, king of Denmark, he returns to the castle, armed with an enchanted lantern that breaks the spell. The consequent misfortunes have a happy ending.

The tale had a continuation giving the adventures of Fursin or Anselet, the nephew of Sornegur.

==Analogues==
The tale is in essence a variant of the legend of [[Cupid and Psyche]]. The name Partonopeus (or Partonopex) is generally assumed to be a corruption of [[Parthenopaeus]], one of the [[Seven against Thebes]], but it has been suggested that the word might be linked to Partenay, due to the points of similarity between this story and the legend of [[Melusine]] (see [[Jean d'Arras]]) attached to the house of [[Lusignan]], as the lords of these two places were connected. The story has also been compared with the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] story of ''[[Le Bel Inconnu]]''.

The romance, or a subsequent version of it, was translated into Old Norse as ''[[Chivalric sagas|Partalópa saga]]''.

'''Political fiction''' employs [[narrative]] to [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems and theories. Works of political [[fiction]], such as '''political novels''', often "directly criticize an existing society or present an alternative, even fantastic, reality".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wesmaps/course0102/hist294s.htm "HIST 294 - Political Fiction"], Wesleyan University, accessed 12 December 2005  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916105750/http://www.wesleyan.edu/wesmaps/course0102/hist294s.htm |date=September 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political novel overlaps with the [[social novel]], [[proletarian novel]], and [[social science fiction]].

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]] written around 380 BC, has been one of the world's most influential works of [[philosophy]] and [[Political philosophy|political theory]], both intellectually and historically.&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio (August 8, 2007). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12594668 Plato's 'Republic' Still Influential, Author Says]. Talk of the Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allphilosophers.com/ Plato: The Republic]. Plato: His Philosophy and his life, allphilosophers.com&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Republic'' is concerned with [[justice]] ([[:Wiktionary:δικαιοσύνη|δικαιοσύνη]]), the order and character of the just [[city-state]], and the just man.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhouse, Thomas and Smith, Nicholas D. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/plato.htm Plato (c. 427–347 BC)], The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, University of Tennessee, cf. ''Dating Plato's Dialogues''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other influential politically-themed works include [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' (1759), and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852).

Political fiction frequently employs [[satire]], often in the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian and dystopian]] genres.
This includes [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[dystopia]]s of the early 20th century such as [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s  ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Political satire==
The [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]]' plays are known for their political and social satire,&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in his criticism of the powerful Athenian general, [[Cleon]], in plays such as ''[[The Knights]]''. Aristophanes is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aristophanes003.html | chapter = Political and social satires of Aristophanes | editor-first = Alfred | editor-last = Bates | title = The Drama, Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization | volume = 2 | place = London | publisher = Historical Publishing | year = 1906 | pages = 55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Atkinson | jstor = 639144 | title = Curbing the Comedians: Cleon versus Aristophanes and Syracosius' Decree | journal = The Classical Quarterly | series = New | volume = 42 | number = 1 | year = 1992 | pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | title = Aristophanes: the Michael Moore of his Day | first = John Louis | last = Anderson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054115/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | archivedate = 2006-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}  His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian [[Menander]], whose early play, ''Drunkenness'', contains an attack on the politician, [[Callimedon]].

[[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' (1729) is an 18th-century [[Juvenal]]ian [[Satire|satirical]] [[essay]] in which he suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. The satirical [[hyperbole]] mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy toward the [[Irish people|Irish]] in general.

[[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) is an [[allegory|allegorical]] and [[dystopian novel|dystopian]] novella which satirises the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html|title=BBC - GCSE English Literature - 'Animal Farm' - historical context (pt 1/3)|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "[[Why I Write]]" (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p.&amp;nbsp;23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and was hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]]—an attitude that had been shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bowker, ''Orwell'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 ; Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and "Spilling the Spanish Beans", ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[Great purge|a reign of terror]]. Orwell described his ''Animal Farm'' as "a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin",{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946) he wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole."

Orwell's most famous work, however, is ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (published in 1949), many of whose terms and concepts, such as ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[doublethink]]'', ''[[thoughtcrime]]'', ''[[Newspeak]]'', ''[[Room 101]]'', ''[[telescreen]]'', ''[[2 + 2 = 5]]'', and ''[[memory hole]]'', have entered into common use. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' popularised the adjective "[[Orwellian]]", which describes official deception, secret surveillance, and manipulation of recorded history by a [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] state.&lt;ref name="English Literature 2000. p. 726"&gt;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, Sixth Edition. University of Oxford Press: 2000. p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th century==
The poet [[Jan Kochanowski]]'s play, ''[[Jan Kochanowski#Works|The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys]]'' (1578), the first [[tragedy]] written in the [[Polish language]], recounts an incident leading up to the [[Trojan War]].  Its theme of the responsibilities of statesmanship resonates to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Kieniewicz]], ed., ''Warszawa w latach 1526–1795'' (Warsaw in the Years 1526–1795), vol. II, Warsaw, 1984, {{ISBN|83-01-03323-1}}, pp. 157–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
The political [[comedy]], ''The Return of the Deputy'' (1790), by [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]]—Polish poet, playwright, statesman, and comrade-in-arms of [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]]—was written in about two weeks' time while Niemcewicz was serving as a deputy to the historic [[Four-Year Sejm]] of 1788–92.  The comedy's premiere in January 1791 was an enormous success, sparking widespread debate, royal communiques, and diplomatic correspondence.  As Niemcewicz had hoped, it set the stage for passage of Poland's epochal [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution of 3 May 1791]], which is regarded as Europe's first, and the world's second, modern written national constitution, after the [[United States Constitution]] implemented in 1789.  The comedy pits proponents against opponents of political reforms:  of abolishing the destabilizing [[Royal elections in Poland|free election]] of Poland's kings; of abolishing the legislatively destructive ''[[liberum veto]]''; of granting greater rights to [[peasant]]s and townspeople; of curbing the privileges of the mostly self-interested [[szlachta|noble class]]; and of promoting a more active Polish role in international affairs, in the interest of stopping the depredations of Poland's neighbors, Russia, Prussia, and Austria (who will in 1795 complete the dismemberment of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]).  Romantic interest is provided by a rivalry between a reformer and a conservative for a young lady's hand—which is won by the proponent of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Zdzisław Skwarczyński|Zdzisław Skwarczyński]], ''wstęp'' (introduction) to [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], ''[[:pl:Powrót posła|Powrót posła]]'' (The Return of the Deputy), Wrocław, [[Ossolineum]], 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century novel==
An early example of the political novel is ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' (1827) by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], an Italian [[historical novel]]. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years of direct Spanish rule, it has been seen sometimes as a veiled attack on the [[Austrian Empire]], which controlled [[Italy]] at the time the novel was written. It has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.&lt;ref name="Archibald Colquhoun 1954"&gt;Archibald Colquhoun. ''Manzoni and his Times.'' J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, London, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s British politician [[Benjamin Disraeli]] wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby; or, The New Generation]]'' (1844), Disraeli, in historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]]'s view, "infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England's future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians."&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/benjamin-disraeli-essays/disraeli-benjamin "Benjamin Disraeli 1804–1881"], '' Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism'', eNotes, accessed 25 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coningsby''  was followed by ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil; or, The Two Nations]]'' (1845), another political novel, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than ''Coningsby''; the "two nations" of its subtitle referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last of Disraeli's political-novel trilogy, ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred; or, The New Crusade]]'' (1847), promoted the Church of England's role in reviving Britain's flagging spirituality.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;

[[Ivan Turgenev]] wrote ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' (1862) as a response to the growing cultural schism that he saw between [[Russia]]'s liberals of the 1830s and 1840s, and the growing Russian [[nihilist movement]] among their sons. Both the nihilists and the 1830s liberals sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the [[Slavophile]]s, who believed that Russia's path lay in its [[Russian Orthodox Church|traditional spirituality]].  Turgenev's novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term "[[Nihilist movement|nihilism]]", which became widely used after the novel was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nihilismus|url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/05/0510_Nihilismus.pdf|publisher=Johannes Kepler University|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Polish writer [[Bolesław Prus]]' novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), is set in the Egypt of 1087&amp;ndash;85 BCE as that country experiences internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its [[Twentieth Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]]. The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge [[The powers that be (phrase)|the powers that be]] are vulnerable to co-option, [[seduction]], subornation, [[defamation]], intimidation, and [[assassination]]. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of [[knowledge]].  Prus' vision of the fall of an ancient civilization derives some of its power from the author's intimate awareness of the final demise of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, a century before he completed ''Pharaoh''.  This is a political awareness that Prus shared with his 10-years-junior novelist compatriot, [[Joseph Conrad]], who was an admirer of Prus' writings.  ''Pharaoh'' has been translated into 20 languages and adapted as a 1966 Polish [[Pharaoh (film)|feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2-3, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known to have been [[Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin's]] favourite book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation", p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th-century novel==
[[Joseph Conrad]] wrote several novels with political themes:  ''[[Nostromo]] (1904)'', ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907), and
''[[Under Western Eyes (novel)|Under Western Eyes]]'' (1911). ''Nostromo'' (1904) is set amid political upheaval in the fictitious [[South America]]n country of Costaguana, where a trusted Italian-descended longshoreman, Giovanni Battista Fidanza—the novel's [[eponym]]ous "Nostromo" (Italian for "our man")—is instructed by English-descended silver-mine owner Charles Gould to take Gould's silver abroad so that it will not fall into the hands of revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Conrad]], ''[[Nostromo]]'', 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of politics is paramount in ''The Secret Agent'', as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The plot to destroy [[Greenwich Observatory]] is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing "must be purely destructive" and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion "should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation."&lt;ref name="anarchist"&gt;{{Citation | first = Joseph | last = Conrad | year = 1993 | title = The Secret Agent | place = London | publisher = Penguin | page = 35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency. Conrad's third political novel, ''Under Western Eyes'', is connected to Russian history. Its first audience read it against the backdrop of the failed [[Revolution of 1905]] and in the shadow of the movements and impulses that would take shape as the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conrad: The Critical Heritage |editor=Norman Sherry |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |year=1973 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad's earlier novella, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), also had political implications, in its depiction of European [[colonialism|colonial]] depredations in [[Africa]], which Conrad witnessed during his employ in the [[Congo Free State|Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology'', 7th edition, 2000, p. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939) is a passionate depiction of the plight of the poor. However, many of Steinbeck's contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack writes: "Steinbeck was attacked as a [[propaganda|propagandist]] and a [[Socialism|socialist]] from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book's depiction of California farmers' attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a 'pack of lies' and labeled it 'communist propaganda'".&lt;ref name=cordyack&gt;{{cite web

''[[The Quiet American]]'' (1955) by English novelist [[Graham Greene]] questions the foundations of growing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s. The novel has received much attention due to its prediction of the outcome of the Vietnam War and subsequent American foreign policy since the 1950s. Graham Greene portrays a U.S. official named Pyle as so blinded by [[American exceptionalism]] that he cannot see the calamities he brings upon the Vietnamese.  The book uses Greene's experiences as a war correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[Le Figaro]]'' in [[French Indochina]] in 1951–54.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Bacevich, "Best Intentions: An Appreciation of Graham Greene".  World Affairs [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/best-intentions-appreciation-graham-greene]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proletarian novel==
The [[proletarian novel]] is written by workers, mainly for other workers. It overlaps and sometimes is synonymous with the working-class novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus, ''The Socialist Novel in Britain: Towards the Recovery of a Tradition''. ( Brighton: Harvester Press, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; socialist novel,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social problem novel|social-problem novel]] (also problem novel, sociological novel, or [[social novel]]),&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996), p.487; "social problem novel." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012.

Preston), ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory''. (London: Penguin, 1999), pp. 704, 913&lt;/ref&gt; and [[socialist realism|socialist-realism]] novel. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or of a political revolution. As such, it is a form of political fiction.

The proletarian novel may [[Political commentary|comment]] on [[political]] events, systems, and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by [[communist]], [[socialist]], and [[anarchist]] authors. It is about the lives of the poor, and the period from 1930 to 1945, in particular, produced many such novels. However, proletarian works were also produced before and after those dates. In Britain, the terms "[[working class|working-class]]" literature, novel, etc., are more generally used.

==Social novel==
A closely related type of novel, which frequently has a political dimension, is the [[social novel]] – also known as the "social-problem" or "social-protest" novel – a "work of fiction in which a prevailing social problem, such as gender, race, or class prejudice, is dramatized through its effect on the characters of a novel".&lt;ref&gt;"social problem novel" in ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 04 Nov. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/664323/social-problem-novel].&lt;/ref&gt; More specific examples of social problems that are addressed in such works include poverty, conditions in factories and mines, the plight of child labor, violence against women, rising criminality, and epidemics caused by overcrowding and poor sanitation in cities.&lt;ref&gt;"Childers, JW (2001)"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Dickens]] was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens "issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together".&lt;ref name="KucichSadoff"&gt;{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[George Orwell]], in his essay on Dickens, wrote: "There is no clear sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown, or that he believes it would make very much difference if it were overthrown. For in reality his target is not so much society as 'human nature'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eliot|first=George|title=Charles Dickens|url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/dickens/english/e_chd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickens's second novel, ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it destroyed middle-class polemics about criminals, making any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]] (1854) is set in a small [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] industrial town and particularly criticizes the effect of [[Utilitarianism]] on the lives of cities' working classes. [[John Ruskin]] declared ''Hard Times'' his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. [[Walter Allen]] characterised ''Hard Times'' as an unsurpassed "critique of industrial society",

[[File:BrownlowasLt.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Wallace Brownlow]] portraying Richard Cholmondeley in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', 1888]]

'''Sir Richard Cholmondeley''' (or '''Cholmeley''') (c. 1460–1521) was an English farmer and soldier, who served as [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] from 1513 to 1520 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  He is remembered because of his tomb at the Tower of London and because he is fictionalized as a character in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s darkly [[comic opera]], ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]''.  Cholmeley's name is frequently misspelled as Cholmondeley because of its misspelling in the plaque on his tomb, which led to the misspelling of the character's name in the opera; other branches of Cholmeley's family use the longer spelling.

Knighted in 1497 for valour in battle against the Scots, Cholmeley continued to serve as a soldier until 1513, becoming entrusted with many positions of responsibility for security of castles and fortifications in England.  He was successful as a farmer and a shrewd investor in land, much increasing his family wealth.  As Lieutenant of the Tower of London, he drew criticism for his reaction to the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517, when he ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city to suppress rioting.  He was also responsible for the rebuilding of the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]] at the Tower.   His illegitimate son, [[Roger Cholmeley]], became [[Lord Chief Justice]] of the court of [[King's Bench]].

==Life and career==
Cholmeley (pronounced "Chumley") was born at Chorley, a small settlement approximately six miles south west of [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]] near [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire|Cholmondeley]], the eldest son of Joan Eyton and John Cholmeley, wealthy sheep farmers and land owners.&lt;ref&gt;Heraldic Visitations Harl 1424 fo.36b, Harl 1505 fo.34b, Cholmondleigh vulgo Cholmeley of Chomley&lt;/ref&gt;  See the heading "Tomb and Family Name", below, regarding the family name.  While Richard was very young, his family moved to East [[Yorkshire]], where his maternal grandfather held extensive estates.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag&gt;{{cite journal| last=Chamley| first=Benson|date=June 2003| title=Sir Richard Cholmondeley, Cheshire's most famous unknown| journal=The Family History Society of Cheshire Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Cholmeley was appointed Bailiff of York in 1492 and [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1495. In 1497, he served under [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] to repel a [[Pedro de Ayala#The Sieges of Norham and Ayton Castles|Scots assault]] at [[Norham]] Castle, a stronghold of the Bishopric of [[Durham, England|Durham]].&lt;ref name=Fiction&gt;Chamley, Benson.  "''The Yeomen of the Guard'': Fact or Fiction", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 648–57&lt;/ref&gt;  For his service, Cholmeley was knighted in the field at Ayton by Lord Surrey as representative of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, William A. ''The Knights of England'', vol. 2, Sherratt and Hughes (1906, reprinted 1971, {{ISBN|0-900455-11-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, he was appointed Lieutenant of [[Berwick upon Tweed]] and Governor of [[Kingston upon Hull]].  In 1499, Cholmeley and his younger brother Roger were appointed Constables of [[Pickering Castle]], [[North Yorkshire]] and Stewards of the Honour and Foresters of the Royal Forest.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  While Roger settled in the constable's lodgings at the castle, Sir Richard purchased a small estate and house at nearby Thornton on the Hill (now part of [[Thornton-le-Dale]]).  In 1506, Cholmeley was appointed Collector of the Great Custom in the [[Port of London]].&lt;ref&gt;25 April 1506 (Membrane 15 no. 847), Appointment of Richard Cholmeley, Knight, as collector of the great custom in the port of London and in all adjacent ports and places in the place of William Tystede, late collector&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1513, the Scots invaded England to meet their treaty obligations to France under the [[Auld Alliance]]. At the [[Battle of Flodden]], the English, including a Cheshire levy under Cholmeley's command, successfully repelled the Scots. He had brought with him the Citizen Yeomenry of Hull. With English victory, Lord Surrey was restored as [[Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

===Lieutenant of the Tower===
In October 1513, Cholmeley was appointed [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] and Supervisor General of [[Richmond Castle]] and eleven other Yorkshire castles and manors.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources list Chomondeley's appointment as Lieutenant in 1509, but this is not consistent with the records of Cholmondeley's military service. See White, William. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA62 ''Notes and Queries''], Oxford University Press, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; There was no suitable house for Cholmeley and his family within the Tower precincts, and so he purchased a house in nearby [[Barking, London|Barking]], where he lived while serving as Lieutenant of the Tower.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt; The Lieutenant served under the [[Constable of the Tower]], at the time [[Thomas Lovell]].&lt;ref&gt;White, William. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA62 ''Notes and Queries''], Oxford University Press, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, p. 664&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of the Lieutenant included defence, maintenance, and custody of the prisoners at the Tower, including escorting prisoners of note to trial at [[Westminster Hall]] which, at that time, housed the courts of law.  Cholmeley's maintenance works included the complete rebuilding of the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]], the parish church of the Tower of London, which had been largely destroyed by fire in 1512.  The construction was carried out in 1519&amp;ndash;20.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

[[File:Yeomen 1906.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene from ''The Yeomen of the Guard'']]
Cholmeley lost some favour with the City of London authorities because of his reaction to the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517. During the riots, he furiously ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city during rioting by gangs of young Londoners, who attacked foreigners, especially the wealthy foreign merchants and bankers of [[Lombard Street, London]] and who took control of London for several days.  This drew the ire of the city elders.  In 1520, he resigned his post at the Tower due to ill health.  He died in March 1521 (1522 by the modern calendar system) in [[St Katharine's by the Tower]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

Cholmeley is the only historical character to appear in a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]''.  In the story of that opera, while serving as Lieutenant of the Tower, Cholmeley finds that a prominent prisoner, scheduled to be executed, has escaped.  He launches a full-scale investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Bradley|year=1996|title=The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=772|isbn = 0-19-816503-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Cholmeley became very wealthy by inheritance and shrewd property investments.  At the time of his death, he held extensive estates in [[Northumberland]], [[Cumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Essex]], [[Middlesex]], [[Kent]] and Calais, along with several properties in London.  By his will dated 26 December 1521, he left the bulk of his estate to his widow Elizabeth (''nee'' Pennington), with bequests to his only issue, his illegitimate son, named [[Roger Cholmeley|Roger]].  Cholmeley willed specific items of value to his younger brother, also named Roger.&lt;ref name=Will&gt;National Archives Records: Consistory Court of Canterbury, Wills and Probates 1383-1558 vol. 1 &amp; 2 (J. G. Challenor Smith:) Will and probate for Sir Richard Cholmeley, December 1521 and March 1522, available online at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmeley's widow, Elizabeth, later married her third husband, Sir William Gascoigne of [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]] (her first husband was Sir Walter Strickland of Sizergh).&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  She died in 1546.  His illegitimate son, [[Roger Cholmeley]], enrolled at [[Lincoln's Inn]] to study law in 1506, eventually becoming Recorder of the City of London (from 1535 to 1545), a [[member of parliament]] and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (from 1545).  He was knighted in 1534.  In May 1552, he was appointed as Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench]].  He was Lord Chief Justice for only a year because [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] would not reappoint him.  Also in 1552, he was imprisoned for six weeks in the [[Tower of London]] and fined for signing [[Lady Jane Grey]]'s instrument of succession as Queen.  He returned to work as a [[barrister]] and was a member of parliament for Middlesex in the early 1550s.  Roger died in 1565, survived by two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;"Cholmley, Sir Roger (c. 1485-1565)", ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;  He is possibly best remembered for his endowment to found a free grammar school, [[Highgate School]], at London.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. H. ''Cholmley, Sir Roger (c. 1485–1565), Judge'' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmeley's brother, Roger, had a son whom he named Richard, whose descendants are the Cholmeleys of Roxby, Bramston and [[Whitby]].  This is the line of the current [[Cholmeley baronets|7th Baronet]], Sir Frederick Sebastian Cholmeley of Easton Hall, [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]].  Cholmeley's cousin, Richard Cholmondeley of [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire]], was married to Elizabeth Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]], whose brother, [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]], was executed in 1536 on suspicion of being [[Anne Boleyn]]'s lover. That branch of the family's descendants, beginning with [[Hugh Cholmondeley (soldier)|Sir Hugh Cholmondeley]], included the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquesses and Earls of Cholmondeley]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

==Tomb and family name==
In 1522, after the rebuilding of St. Peter ad Vincula, a tomb was built in the church covered by effigies of Cholmeley and his wife. The monument is one of the oldest in the chapel, where many famous people who were executed at the Tower are buried.  The alabaster effigies lie fenced in ironwork under the central arcade.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

However, Cholmeley is not buried in this tomb.  In his will, he requests that he be buried "within the Chapel of our blessed Lady of Barking beside the Tower of London" (now called "All Hallows, Barking") and that if the Masters and Wardens would not agree, then "my body be buried in the Church of the Crutched Friars beside the Tower of London" (now called "St. Olaf's").  All Hallows was almost totally destroyed during the blitz of London during [[World War II]], and so it is not known whether he was buried there or at St. Olaf's.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  There is some evidence that he may have been buried in one of the tombs of the Cholmondeley, Cheshire branch of his family.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

Cholmeley's family can be traced back to the 12th century Robert de Chelmundelegh, second son of William le Belward, who inherited parts of the Barony of Malpas (for which [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] is named), including Cholmondeley, Cheshire, previously held by Robert Fitzhugh.  Over the centuries, the family name was spelled in many variants as [[middle-English]] developed away from French influences.  Different branches of the family spell the name differently, and Cholmeley's most famous cousins, of Cholmondeley, Cheshire, spell the name "Cholmondeley".&lt;ref&gt;Thornber, Craig. [http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/htmlfiles/cholmond.html "Cholmondeley Castle Gardens: The Cholmondeley family"], Thornber.net, 19 July 2000, accessed 6 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, Sir Richard's tomb in St. Peter ad Vincula was relocated and had a new name panel fitted.  The panel states that the Lieutenant of the Tower was named Richard "Cholmondeley".  Thus, Gilbert and Sullivan called him "Sir Richard Cholmondeley".  However, Sir Richard's father was John Cholmeley, his grandfather was William Cholmeley, and his brother was Roger Cholmeley.  His will is signed Richard Cholmeley and his illegitimate son was Sir [[Roger Cholmeley]].  After the Cholmondeley branch became the more highly titled branch of the family, Sir Richard Cholmeley, Lieutenant of the Tower, was confused with his cousin, Richard Cholmondeley of Cholmondeley, Cheshire, or one of the five knights named Richard Cholmondeley, Chomondley or Cholmeley living around the same time.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;

'''Robert Adam''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|FSA (Scot)]] [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]]}} (3 July 1728 – 3 March 1792) was a Scottish [[neoclassical architect]], interior designer and [[furniture designer]]. He was the son of [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother [[John Adam (architect)|John]], Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the [[Board of Ordnance]], after William's death.

In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]]. Here he developed the "[[Adam Style]]", and his theory of "movement" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of [[Office of Works|Architect of the King's Works]] from 1761 to 1769.

Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in [[Architecture of the United States|North America]]. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses.&lt;ref&gt;Adam silver (1953). Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London. Her Majesty's Stationery Office ([[HMSO]]), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the member of Parliament for [[Kinross-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross-shire]] from 1768 to 1774.&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waterston |first1=Charles D|last2=Macmillan Shearer |first2=A|title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002: Biographical Index|url=http://www.rse.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2011|volume=I|date=July 2006|publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-902198-84-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[Image:High School, Blackfriars 1578.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Royal High School (1578–1777) on site of Blackfriars Monastery, Edinburgh.]]
Adam was born on 3 July 1728 at Gladney House in [[Kirkcaldy]], Fife, the second son Mary Robertson (1699–1761), the daughter of William Robertson of Gladney, and architect William Adam.&lt;ref name="celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/105|title=Adam, Robert (1728–1792), architect|last=|first=|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/105}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he was noted as having a "feeble constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; From 1734 at the age of six Adam attended the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; where he learned [[Latin]] (from the second year lessons were conducted in Latin)&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 4"&gt;Graham, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; until he was 15, he was taught to read works by [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Sallust]] and parts of [[Cicero]] and in his final year [[Livy]].&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 4"/&gt; In autumn 1743 he matriculated at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 26"&gt;Graham, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and compulsory classes for all students were: the [[Greek language]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 26"/&gt; Students could choose three elective subjects, Adam attended classes in mathematics, taught by [[Colin Maclaurin]], and anatomy, taught by [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro ''primus'']].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His studies were interrupted by the arrival of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] and his Highlanders, who occupied Edinburgh during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 Jacobite rising]]. At the end of the year, Robert fell seriously ill for some months, and it seems unlikely that he returned to university, having completed only two years of study.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

On his recovery from illness in 1746, he joined his elder brother John as apprentice to his father. He assisted William Adam on projects such as the building of [[Inveraray Castle]] and the continuing extensions of [[Hopetoun House]]. William's position as Master Mason to the [[Board of Ordnance]] also began to generate much work, as the Highlands were fortified following the failed [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolt]]. Robert's early ambition was to be an artist rather than architect, and the style of his early sketches in the manner of [[Salvator Rosa]] are reflected in his earliest surviving architectural drawings, which show picturesque [[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Folly|follies]].&lt;ref name="Fleming81"&gt;Fleming, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; William Adam died in June 1748, and left Dowhill, a part of the Blair Adam estate which included a [[tower house]], to Robert.

===Architectural practice in Edinburgh===
[[Image:Hopetoun03.JPG|thumb|250px|Entrance front of [[Hopetoun House]], designed by William Adam and modified by the Adam Brothers]]

On William Adam's death, John Adam inherited both the family business and the position of Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance. He immediately took Robert into partnership, later to be joined by James Adam. The Adam Brothers' first major commission was the decoration of the grand [[state apartments]] on the first floor at Hopetoun House, followed by their first "new build" at [[Dumfries House]]. For the Board of Ordnance, the brothers were the main contractor at [[Fort George, Highland|Fort George]], a large modern fort near [[Inverness]] designed by [[military engineer]] Colonel Skinner. Visits to this project, begun in 1750, would occupy the brothers every summer for the next 10 years, and, along with works at many other barracks and forts, provided Robert with a solid foundation in practical building.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1749–1750, Adam travelled to London with his friend, the poet [[John Home]]. He took the opportunity for architectural study, visiting [[Wilton House|Wilton]], designed by [[Inigo Jones]], and the Queens Hermitage in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] by Roger Morris. His sketchbook of the trip also shows a continuing interest in gothic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his friends at Edinburgh were the philosophers [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[David Hume]] and the artist [[Paul Sandby]] whom he met in the Highlands. Other Edinburgh acquaintances included Gilbert Elliot, [[William Wilkie]], John Home and [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]].&lt;ref name="Fleming81"/&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[File:SPLIT-Adam plan restitution.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of the Diocletian palace in Split, Croatia. R. Adam 1764]]
[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Peristyle of the Diocletian palace in Split, Croatia. R. Adam 1764]]
On 3 October 1754, Robert Adam in the company of his brother James (who went as far as Brussels) set off from Edinburgh for his [[Grand Tour]], stopping for a few days in London, where they visited the [[Mansion House, London]], [[St Stephen Walbrook]],&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Paul's Cathedral]], Windsor, Berkshire, in the company of [[Thomas Sandby]] who showed them his landscaping at [[Windsor Great Park]] and [[Virginia Water Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; They sailed from [[Dover]] arriving in [[Calais]]&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; on 28 October 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Charles Hope-Weir]], brother of the [[John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun|Earl of Hopetoun]] in Brussels&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and together they travelled to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Hope agreed to take Adam on the tour at the suggestion of his uncle, the Marquess of Annandale, who had undertaken the Grand Tour himself. While in Brussels the pair attended a Play and [[wikt:masquerade|Masquerade]], as well as visiting churches and palaces in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling on to [[Tournai]], then [[Lille]], where they visited the Citadal designed by [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; By 12 November 1754 Adam and Hope were in Paris where they took lodgings in Hotel de Notre Dame.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam and Hope travelled on to Italy together, before falling out in Rome over travelling expenses and accommodation. Robert Adam stayed on in Rome until 1757, studying classical architecture and honing his drawing skills. His tutors included the French architect and artist [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]], and the Italian artist [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]. Here, he became acquainted with the work of the pioneering classical archaeologist and art historian, theorist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. On his return journey, Adam and Clerisseau spent time intensively studying the ruins of [[Diocletian's Palace]] at Spalato in [[Dalmatia]] (now known as [[Split (city)|Split]], in modern [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691 C.M. Hogan, "Diocletian's Palace", The Megalithic Portal, A. Burnham ed, 6 Oct 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were later published as ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' in 1764.

===Architectural practice in London===
[[Image:Admiralty Screen.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Screen 1759-61, Whitehall, London, one of Adam's first executed buildings after his grand tour]]
[[Image:Kedleston Hall 20080730-06.jpg|thumb|[[Kedleston Hall]]. The south front by Robert Adam, based on the [[Arch of Constantine]] in Rome]]
He returned to Britain in 1758 and set up in business in London with his brother James Adam. They focused on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] design was popular, and Robert designed a number of country houses in this style,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; but he evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] design alongside influences from [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their design. In Adam interiors, all the furnishings were custom designed to accord with the decoration of the room in a unified harmony. Often the carpets were woven to match the intricate patterns of the ceiling above, while every fitting including sconces, mirrors, and doorknobs also received a custom design emulating the motifs of the room.&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Neoclassicism| author=David Irwin| publisher=Phaidon| year=1997| p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Adams' practice was not without mishap, however. In 1768 the Adam brothers purchased a 99-year lease for a marshy plot of land beside the Thames in [[Westminster, London|Westminster]], where they built a 24-house terrace development known as the [[Adelphi Buildings|Adelphi]].&lt;ref name="Parissien"&gt;{{cite book| title=Adam Style| author=Steven Parissien| publisher=Phaidon| year=1992| p=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was very ambitious and is the first instance where terraced houses were designed individually to give unified harmony to the whole development (previously terraced houses were built to one replicated design side-by-side, around a square).&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt; However, the project became a [[white elephant]] for Robert and his brothers, with uncertain financing and costs spiraling out of control. The houses were built on a huge artificial terrace resting on vaulted substructures on the level of the Thames, which Robert Adam was certain could be leased to the British government as warehouses. However, this interest failed to materialize, and the Adam brothers were left with huge debts and in 1772 had to lay off 3,000 workmen and cease building. Adam himself moved into one of the houses in the Adelphi, along with supportive friends like [[David Garrick]] and [[Josiah Wedgewood]], who opened a showroom for his ceramics in one of the houses. In 1774, a public lottery was held to raise funds for the brothers, which allowed them to avert bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt;

==Public life==
[[Image:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One of Adam's masterpieces: [[Pulteney Bridge]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]]]

Adam was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1758 and of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1761, the same year he was appointed Architect of the [[Office of Works|King's Works]] (jointly with [[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]]). His younger brother James succeeded him in this post when he relinquished the role in 1768 to devote more time to his elected office as member of Parliament for [[Kinross-shire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross-shire]].

==Architectural style==
Robert Adam rejected the [[Palladian]] style, as introduced to England by [[Inigo Jones]], and advocated by [[Lord Burlington]], as "ponderous" and "disgustful".&lt;ref name="G&amp;M106"&gt;Glendinning and McKechnie, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from [[classical antiquity]], during his four-year stay in Europe.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M106"/&gt; Adam developed a new style of architectural decoration, one which was more archaeologically accurate than past Neoclassical styles, but nonetheless innovative and not bound only by ancient precedents. In ''Works in Architecture'', co-authored with his brother James, the brothers stated that Graeco-Roman examples should "serve as models which we should imitate, and as standards by which we ought to judge."&lt;ref name="Parissien"&gt;{{cite book| title=Adam Style| author=Steven Parissien| publisher=Phaidon| year=1992| p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries in [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] ongoing at the time provided ample material for Robert Adam to draw on for inspiration.&lt;ref name="Parissien"/&gt;

The Adam brothers' principle of "movement" was largely Robert's conception, although the theory was first written down by James. "Movement" relied on dramatic contrasts and diversity of form, and drew on the [[picturesque]] aesthetic. The first volume of the Adam brother's ''Works'' (1773) cited [[Kedleston Hall]], designed by Robert in 1761, as an outstanding example of movement in architecture.

By contrasting room sizes and decorative schemes, Adam applied the concept of movement to his interiors also. His style of decoration, described by Pevsner as "Classical [[Rococo]]", drew on Roman "[[grotesque]]" [[stucco]] decoration.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Bookcase, Robert Adam (1728-1792), 1776 -IMG 1604.JPG|thumb|right|Adam designed bookcase 1776, probably built by Thomas Chippendale]] 
Robert Adam's work had influenced the direction of architecture and design across the western world. In England his collaboration with Thomas Chippendale resulted in some of the finest neoclassicist designs of the time, most notably in the [[Harewood House]] collection of Chippendale's work. In North America, the [[Federal style]] owes much to neoclassicism as practised by Adam. In Europe, Adam notably influenced [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]], the Scotsman who designed [[Tsarskoye Selo]] and other Russian palaces for [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Glendinning &amp; McKechnie, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time of his death, Adam's neoclassicism was being superseded in Britain by a more severe, Greek phase of the classical revival, as practised by [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James "Athenian" Stuart]]. The Adam brothers employed several draughtsmen who would go on to establish themselves as architects, including [[George Richardson (architect)|George Richardson]], and the Italian [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder|Joseph Bonomi]], who Robert originally hired in Rome.

During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, ''Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam'' (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

==Death and burial==
Adam had long suffered from stomach and bowel problems,&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Roderick (2009) ''Arbiter of Elegance: A Biography of Robert Adam'', Birlinn, {{ISBN|978-1-84158-802-5}}, pp. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; probably caused by a [[peptic ulcer]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]]. While at home – 11 [[Albermarle Street]], London – on 1 March 1792, one of the ulcers burst, and on 3 March Adam died.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

The funeral was held on 10 March; he was buried in the south aisle of [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; The [[pall-bearer]]s were several of his clients: [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch]]; [[George Coventry, 6th Earl of Coventry]]; [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale]]; [[David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield]]; [[Lord Frederick Campbell]] and [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet]].&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

Knowing he was dying, he drafted his will on 2 March 1792. Having never married, Adam left his estate to his sisters Elizabeth Adam and Margaret Adam.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

His [[obituary]] appeared in the March 1792 edition of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is somewhat remarkable that the Arts should be deprived at the same time of two of their greatest ornaments, Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and Mr Adam: and it is difficult to say which of them excelled most in his particular profession... 
Mr Adam produced a total change in the architecture of this country: and his fertile genius in elegant ornament was not confined to the decoration of buildings, but has been diffused to every branch of manufacture. His talents extend beyond the lie of his own profession: he displayed in his numerous drawings in landscape a luxuriance of composition, and an effect of light and shadow, which have scarcely been equalled...to the last period of his life, Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of genius and refinement of taste: for in the space of one year preceding his death, he designed eight great public works, besides twenty five private buildings, so various in their style, and so beautiful in their composition, that they have been allowed by the best judges, sufficient of themselves, to establish his fame unrivalled as an artist.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He left nearly 9,000 drawings, 8,856 of which (by both Robert and James Adam) were subsequently purchased in 1833 for £200 by the architect [[John Soane]] and are now at the [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Soane Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;page 11, The Adam Brothers in Rome: Drawings from the Grand Tour, A.A.

'''Sarah Angelina ("Angie") Acland''' (26 June 1849 – 2 December 1930) was an English amateur photographer, known for her portraiture and as a pioneer of [[colour photography]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book| first=Giles | last=Hudson | url=http://www.bodleianbookshop.co.uk/display.asp?K=9781851243723 | title=Sarah Angelina Acland: First Lady of Colour Photography | publisher=[[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford]] | location=Oxford |  isbn=978 1 85124 372 3 | accessdate=16 January 2013 | year=2012 }} Distributed by [http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/S/bo13171216.html The University of Chicago Press] in the US.&lt;/ref&gt; She was credited by her contemporaries with inaugurating colour photography "as a process for the travelling amateur", by virtue of the photographs she took during two visits to [[Gibraltar]] in 1903 and 1904.

==Life==
[[File:Colonel William Willoughby Verner, Sanger Shepherd process, by Sarah Acland 1903.png|thumb|left|[[William Willoughby Cole Verner|Col. Willoughby Verner]], 1903 photograph by Acland.]]

Sarah Acland was the daughter of Sir [[Henry Wentworth Acland]] (1815–1900), [[Regius Professor of Medicine (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Medicine]] at [[Oxford University]], and [[Sarah Acland]] (née Cotton, 1815–1878), after whom the [[Acland Hospital]] in [[Oxford]] was named. She lived with her parents at 40–41 [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]], central Oxford.&lt;ref name="halhed"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.halhed.com/t4r/getperson.php?personID=I3996&amp;tree=tree1|title = Sarah Angelina (Angie) Acland|work = Halhed Genealogy &amp; Family Trees|accessdate = 19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Sarah Acland was photographed by [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]] (aka [[Lewis Carroll]]) with her friend Ina Liddell, the sister of [[Alice Liddell]].&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite web|first = Michael|last = Pritchard|url = http://britishphotohistory.ning.com/profiles/blogs/book-sarah-angelina-acland-re-discovered-as-one-of-the-pioneers-o|title = Book: Sarah Angelina Acland re-discovered as one of the Pioneers of Colour Photography|publisher = Ning|work = British photographic history|date = 14 September 2012|accessdate = 16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=Roger |last1=Taylor | first2=Edward | last2=Wakeling | title=Lewis Carroll: Photographer – The Princeton University Library Albums | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | location=Princeton and Oxford | ISBN=0-691-07443-7 | year=2002 | pages=160, 167, 250–251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 5, on 20 June 1855, she and one of her brothers presented a trowel to [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby]], [[Chancellor of Oxford University]], at the laying of the foundation stone for the [[Oxford University Museum]].&lt;ref name="broad-street"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/broad/history/cabmen_shelter.htm|title = The cabmen's shelter|work = Broad Street, Oxford|publisher = Headington|location = Oxford, UK|accessdate = 19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art critic [[John Ruskin]] taught her art and she also knew a number of the [[Pre-Raphaelites]]. She even assisted [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] when he was painting murals at the [[Oxford Union]].

At the age of 19, Acland met and was influenced by photographer [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Ackland took portraits and landscapes. For example, she took a portrait photograph of the Prime Minister [[William Gladstone]] during a visit by him to Oxford.&lt;ref name="oxford-mail"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/oxford/9943252.Book_provides_picture_of_photography_pioneer/ | title=Book provides picture of photography pioneer | first=Andrew | last=Ffrench | newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] | date=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the death of her mother in 1878, Sarah became her father's housekeeper at the family home in Broad Street until his death in 1900.&lt;ref name="broad-street" /&gt; In 1885, she instigated a [[cabmen's shelter]] in the middle of Broad Street, which stood there until 1912.

Acland started to experiment with colour photography in 1899. Her earliest work was accomplished using the [[Frederic Eugene Ives|Ives Kromskop]] and [[Sanger Shepherd]] colour processes, in which three separate photographs were taken through red, green, and blue filters. In 1903 Acland visited her brother [[Sir William Acland, 2nd Baronet|Admiral Acland]] at his home in Gibraltar. Acland took photographs of [[Europa Point]] looking out from Europe to Africa, pictures of flora in the Admiral's residence, [[The Mount (Gibraltar)|The Mount]], and the author and ornithologist Colonel [[William Willoughby Cole Verner]].&lt;ref name="matters"&gt;{{cite web|title = Images for news release "Sarah Angelina Acland re-discovered as one of the pioneers of colour photography"|url = http://mattersphotographical.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/sarah-angelina-acland-images/|first = Giles|last = Hudson|date = 14 November 2012|work = Mattersphotographical|accessdate = 24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, she exhibited at the Annual Exhibition of the [[Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain]] with 33 three-colour prints under the title ''The Home of the Osprey, Gibraltar''.&lt;ref name="exhibit"&gt;{{cite web| title=1904 Forty-ninth Annual Exhibition of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain | url=http://erps.dmu.ac.uk/exhibit_details.php?serial=23726 | publisher=[[De Montfort University]] | location=UK | accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later used the [[Autochrome]] process of the [[Lumiere brothers]], introduced in 1907. In her later life after the death of her father, until her death in 1930, Sarah Acland lived in [[Park Town, Oxford|Park Town]], [[North Oxford]], taking many colour photographs there. She also visited and widely photographed on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] island of [[Madeira]], staying at [[Reid's Hotel]] to the west of central [[Funchal]].

Sarah Acland was a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] (FRPS) and the [[Royal Society of Arts]] ([[FRSA]]).&lt;ref name="thepeerage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3133.htm#i31323 | title=Sarah Angelina Acland |publisher=www.thepeerage.com| accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She never married, and in 1901, the year after her father's death, she moved to Clevedon House, now 10 Park Town, Oxford, where she died in 1930.&lt;ref name="halhed" /&gt; A blue plaque was dedicated to her on this house on 24 July 2016.

'''''Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation''''' ({{lang-zh|t=冥王聖幀}}, literally "Sacred Scroll of the King of the Underworld") is a [[Yuan dynasty]] [[silk painting|silk]] [[hanging scroll]], measuring 142 × 59 centimetres and dating from the 13th century, with didactic themes: a multi-scenic narrative that depicts Mani's Teachings about the Salvation combines a sermon subscene with the depictions of [[Soteriology|soteriological]] teaching in the rest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Mani's-Pictures"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2015 |title=Mani's Pictures: The Didactic Images of the Manichaeans from Sasanian Mesopotamia to Uygur Central Asia and Tang-Ming China |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill Publishers |page=245 |isbn=9789004308947 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was regarded as a depiction of the [[Desire realm|six realms]] of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]] by [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhists]], therefore it was called "Painting of the Six Paths of Rebirth" ({{lang-ja|六道図}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kintetsu-g-hd.co.jp/culture/yamato/shuppan/binotayori/pdf/168/2009_168_5.pdf |title=「六道図（大和文華館）」をめぐって |date=2009 |website=kintetsu-g-hd.co.jp |language=ja |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being studied by scholars like {{ill|Takeo Izumi|ja|泉武夫 (美術史学者)}}, {{ill|Yutaka Yoshida (linguist)|lt=Yutaka Yoshida|ja|吉田豊 (言語学者)}}, [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]] and [[Jorinde Ebert]], they concluded that the painting is a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ma |first=Xiaohe |date=2014 |title=霞浦文書研究 |trans-title=A Study of the Xiapu Manichaean Manuscripts |url=http://img.univs.cn/webfile/event/2015/6/15/293/1434333823741_3143072.pdf |location=Lanzhou |publisher=Lanzhou University Press |language=zh-Hant |page=35 |isbn=9787311046699}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably produced by a 13th-century painter from [[Ningbo]], a city located in southern China,&lt;ref name=A-Visual-Sermon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/28628966/_A_Visual_Sermon_on_Mani_s_Teaching_of_Salvation_A_Contextualized_Reading_of_a_Chinese_Manichaean_Silk_Painting_in_the_Collection_of_the_Yamato_Bunkakan_in_Nara_Japan._Studies_on_the_Inner_Asian_Languages_23_2008_1-16 |title=A Visual Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation: A Contextualized Reading of a Chinese Manichaean Silk Painting in the Collection of the Yamato Bunkakan in Nara, Japan |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2008 |website=academia.edu |access-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is kept today in the [[Museum of Japanese Art|Museum of Japanese Art Yamato Bunkakan]] in [[Nara, Nara]].

== Description ==
The painting is divided into five scenes, with titles given by [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]], a Hungarian specialist on Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6173/2966 |title=Searching for Mani's ''Picture-Book'' in Textual and Pictorial Sources |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2011 |publisher=Heidelberg University Publishing |accessdate=27 November 2018 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Light Maiden's Visit to Heaven'': the first section at the top depicts heaven as a palatial building that forms the focus of a narration of events with the repeated images of a few mythological beings: the Maiden of Light visiting the heaven. It shows on the left the greetings by the host of heaven upon the arrival of Maiden of Light, meeting with the host in the palace in the middle and the Maiden leaving heaven on the right.
* ''Sermon Around a Statue of Mani'': the second scene is the main section and largest among the five, it depicts a sermon performed around the statue of a Manichaean deity ([[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]) by two Manichaean elects dressing in white on the right. The elect giving the sermon is seated, while his assistant is standing. On the left seated the layman dressing in red and his attendant, listen to the sermon.
* ''States of Good Reincarnation'': the third section is further divided into four small squares, each portraying one of [[Four occupations|four classes of Chinese society]] in order to capture what seems to be the daily life of the Chinese Manichaean laity. From left to right, the first scene represents itinerant labourers; the second, craftsmen; the third, farmers, and the fourth, aristocrats.
[[File:Daênâ with Her Attendants (Manichaean Sermon).jpg|thumb|left|Detail: Maiden of Light on a cloud formation with her attendants.]]
* ''The Light Maiden's Intervention in a Judgement'': the fourth scene shows a judge seated behind a desk surrounded by his aides in a pavilion on an elevated platform, to the front of which two pairs of demons lead their captives to hear their fates. In the upper left corner, the Maiden of Light arrives on a cloud formation with two attendants, to intervene on behalf of the man about to be judged. This section is a depiction of the Manichaean view of judgement after death. The French historian [[Étienne de la Vaissière]] compared the judgement scene with that displayed on the [[Sogdia]]n [[Tomb of Wirkak|Wirkak]]'s sarcophagus, and concluded that they are strikingly similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/20031662/_Wirkak_Manichaean_Zoroastrian_Khurram%C3%AE_On_bilingualism_and_syncretism_in_Sogdian_funerary_art_Papers_in_Honour_of_Professor_Yutaka_YOSHIDA_and_Professor_Masaharu_ARAKAWA_on_Their_60th_Birthday_Studies_on_the_Inner_Asian_Languages_30_2015_p._95-112 |title=Wirkak: Manichaean, Zoroastrian, Khurramî? |last=La Vaissière |first=Étienne de |author-link=Étienne de la Vaissière |date=2015 |website=academia.edu |page=100 |access-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''States of Bad Reincarnation'': the final scene depicting four fearful images of hell that include, from left to right, a demon shooting arrows at a person suspended from a red frame in the upper left corner; a person hung upside down and being dismembered by two demons; a fiery wheel rolled over a person; and lastly a group of demons waiting for their next victims.

== Analysis ==
Zsuzsanna Gulácsi states in her article ''A Visual Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation'': {{Quote|text=The [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] origin of this Chinese painting is unquestionable for three principal reasons: its dedicatory inscription that bestowed the object on a [[Chinese Manichaeism|Chinese Manichaean]] temple most likely at [[Ningbo]], in [[Zhejiang]] province; the iconography of its main deity, [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], as well as that of the elect (Manichaean priests), who are shown in Chinese versions of characteristically Manichaean attire; and the significant amount of documentary evidence on the worship of Manichaean deities (Mani and [[Jesus]]) represented in pictorial and sculptural forms by the Manichaean communities of southern China, especially [[Fujian]] and Zhejiang provinces, between the 10th and 17th centuries. […] This hanging scroll is clearly not a devotional work of art that was used for the purposes of religious worship. It is dominated by a narrative character displayed throughout its complex pictorial program that relies on a large set of uniquely arranged individual scenes. Although the sequence of the scenes is logical, it is not self-evident. Their comprehension implies a beholder familiar with Manichaean religious teaching. We have seen that various compositional elements, just as a comprehensive theme, unite the individual registers (scenes) into this intricate image that is hardly suitable for casual viewing. Therefore, this silk painting can be best interpreted as a didactic work of art designed as a visual aid for religious instruction. If so, this painting constitutes a prime example of such an image that was used by a Manichaean community in ca. 13th-century southern China, possibly in the region of Ningbo, in Zhejiang province.&lt;ref name=A-Visual-Sermon /&gt;}}

"'''Shangri-La'''" is a song written by [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]]. The song appeared on the 1969 [[concept album]], ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]].'' The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the "designed community" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration.  The song's highly ironic lyrics comment on British class society while portraying Arthur, the album's ill-fated protagonist, and his empty life in the suburbs.  The musical aspects of the song both reflect and comment on the mood of the lyrics.

"Shangri-La" was released as the second single from ''Arthur'' in the United Kingdom, backed with "This Man He Weeps Tonight." The single was a commercial failure, not reaching the charts in any countries besides the Netherlands. The members of the band, however, thought highly of the song, with both [[Dave Davies]] and [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]] singling it out for praise.

==Lyrics and music==

The initial inspiration for "Shangri-La" came when Rose Davies, the sister of Kinks members Ray and Dave Davies, moved with her husband to Australia.&lt;ref name=allday/&gt; When the band performed a show in the area during January 1964, the Davies brothers visited their sister in the [[Adelaide]] village, Little Elizabeth, where she and her family lived in a semi-detached home in a "[[Planned community|designed community]]."&lt;ref name="allday"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Doug|title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|publisher=Backbeat Books|pages=144–162|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was later used as the basis for the song in 1969.

The track forms the centrepiece of ''Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)''.&lt;ref name=rogan/&gt;  The song opens quietly with the picking of an [[acoustic guitar]] in a [[Key (music)|minor key]], soon to be joined by Davies singing.&lt;ref name="Emlen (Chords/Lyrics)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chords for "Shangri-la"|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php?chord=347|website=Dave Emlen's Unoficial Kinks Web Site|publisher=Dave Emlen's Unoficial Kinks Web site|accessdate=4 December 2015}} - chords and lyrics&lt;/ref&gt;  The lyrics are rife with commentary on British [[Social class|class society]] and are highly [[Irony|ironic]], and in the beginning seemingly condescending, as they mock the illusions of the protagonist Arthur, speaking of his modest home, which he has paid for through a life of toil and hard work, as if it is a some kind of paradise or "kingdom to command," replete with typical modern conveniences such as indoor plumbing and a rocking chair, unlike the kind of working class house in which he grew up with "lavatories in the back yard," but which has turned out to become strangling and prisonlike with "mortgage hanging over his head," "bills and the water rates and payments on the car," as well as nosy and meddlesome neighbors.&lt;ref name="Wawzenek (Arthur)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wawzenek|first1=Bryan|title=46 Years Ago: The Kinks’ Heady Ambitions Drive ‘Arthur’|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-kinks-arthur/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=4 December 2015|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchner (irony in Shangri La)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchner|first1=Stuart|title=Put the Kettle On, Mate, and Have a Cuppa Ray Davies|url=http://www.towntopics.com/mar0106/book.html|website=Record Review|publisher=Record Review|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rogan/&gt;&lt;ref name=kitts/&gt;&lt;ref name="doctorjimmy (Shagri La)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=n/a|first1=doctorjimmy|title=The Kinks-  Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/68258/The-Kinks-Arthur-Or-the-Decline-and-Fall-of-the-British-Empire/|website=Sputnik Music|publisher=Sputnik Music|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emlen (Chords/Lyrics)"/&gt;  Davies provides a note of empathy for Arthur's empty life in a line stating that he accepts this because "he's conditioned that way."&lt;ref name=kitts/&gt;  However, the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] rocks harder as the lyrics express anger at the superficial suburban lifestyle that Arthur has bought into and his fear of confronting a "false Eden."&lt;ref name=kitts/&gt;

The band's guitarist, [[Dave Davies]], has since said that the song's lyrics were misunderstood. He said, "Particularly, I like 'Shangri-La,' a very compassionate song which was totally misinterpreted as though we were having a go at the little, common man."&lt;ref name="out of the survivors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Resnicoff|first1=Matt|title=Dave Davies - Out Of The Survivors|journal=Guitar Player|date=March 1990|url=http://www.davedavies.com/articles/gp_0390.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212828/http://www.davedavies.com/articles/gp_0390.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Music critic [[Johnny Rogan]] calls the song "one of Davies' best from the period," noting that "his ambivalence to the subject is evident throughout as he takes an alternately affectionate and sardonic look at cosy middle class aspiration."&lt;ref name=rogan&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of the Kinks|author=[[Johnny Rogan|Rogan, J.]]|page=71|year=1998|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0711963142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Allmusic]] critic Stewart Mason agrees that "Shangri-La" is "one of Ray Davies' finest songs ever."&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La|author=Mason, S.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/shangri-la-mt0014690883|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Starostin, on his music review website "Only Solitaire", praises the song, saying that it "ranks as one of the top three or four Kinks' songs ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Starostin |first1=George |title=The Kinks |url=http://starling.rinet.ru/music/kinks.htm#Arthur |website=Only Solitaire |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shangri-La" was released as a single in Britain, but like the Kinks previous single, "[[Drivin' (The Kinks song)|Drivin]],{{'"}} "Shangri-La" failed to chart in the UK or US.&lt;ref name=kitts&gt;{{cite book|title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else|author=Kitts, T.M.|pages=137–140|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=041597769X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Davies has since expressed disappointment in the single's lack of commercial success, saying, "Ray was writing fantastic, sensitive words that were so relevant to what was going on - better than any politician. I was really surprised at the response we got to (single) 'Shangri-La,' because I thought it was going to be a massive, massive hit."&lt;ref name=comebackkink&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Dave|title=Comeback Kink|journal=The Guitar Magazine|date=January 1999|url=http://www.davedavies.com/articles/tgm_0199.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212833/http://www.davedavies.com/articles/tgm_0199.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say, "As a creative person you may think you've failed at something, then find out later that you've really learned from it. I wish I'd realised that when I was feeling really shitty about 'Shangri-La' not being number one." It did reach number 27 in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/charts.html|title=International Chart Positions|author=Emlen, Dave|work=Kindakinks.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sleeper hit''' is a term used in the [[Outline of entertainment|entertainment industry]] for a [[film]] that plays successfully for a long period and becomes a big success, despite having relatively little promotion or lacking a successful opening.{{sfn|Berra|2008|p=68}} It is also used in a similar sense for [[music release]]s and video games.

== In film ==
Some sleeper hits in the [[film industry]] are strategically marketed for audiences subtly, such as with [[sneak preview]]s a couple of weeks prior to release, without making them feel obliged to see a heavily promoted film. This alternative form of [[marketing strategy]] has been used in sleeper hits such as ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]'' (1997), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' (1999).{{sfn|Berra|2008|p=68}}

[[Film screening|Screenings]] for these films are held in an area conducive to the film's demographic. In the case of ''Sleepless in Seattle'', a [[romantic comedy]], screenings were held at suburban shopping malls where romantic couples in their mid 20s to early 30s spent Saturday afternoons before seeing a new film. In theory, a successful screening leads to [[word-of-mouth marketing]], as it compels viewers to discuss an interesting, low-key film with co-workers when they return to work after their weekend.{{sfn|Berra|2008|p=68}}

''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), which was created on a budget of less than $400,000, became a sleeper hit by earning $50&amp;nbsp;million and garnering attention from younger audiences with its combination of drugs, violence, motorcycles, counter-culture stance, and rock music.{{sfn|Ganeri|Bergan|2006|p=458}}

''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' was considered a flop for the first 6 months of its release until it found popularity in midnight screenings.

The 1979 Australian film ''[[Mad Max]]'', which sprung from the [[Ozploitation]] movement and helped to popularise the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic dystopia]] genre, held the record for the biggest profit-to-cost ratio for several years until it was broken by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20828245_30188940,00.html|title=Summer Sleepers: 14 Unexpected Movie Hits|author=Lanford Beard|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[independent film]] ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', which played over the course of fall 1978 through fall 1979 and relied almost completely on word-of-mouth as marketing, was also a sleeper hit, having a box-office take of $70&amp;nbsp;million on a budget of only $325,000. Its success caused other [[slasher films]] to try the same approach, although few fared as well since horror films heavily rely on opening weekend box-office and quickly fall from theaters. Other notable examples of horror sleeper-hits to follow in ''Halloween'''s wake include ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' in 1984, ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' in 1996, ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' in 1999, ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' in 2004, and ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=The slasher movie book|date=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=1556520107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
Don Howard's 1952 recording of "[[Oh Happy Day (1952 song)|Oh Happy Day]]" was one of the earliest sleeper hits. Featuring only Howard's baritone vocals and his acoustic guitar played at an amateur level, it was initially released regionally and was never expected to become a hit. A massive groundswell of support from teenagers in Howard's home base of [[Cleveland]], Ohio led to the song rapidly rising in popularity,&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889646,00.html?iid=digg_share |title=Mystery Hit – |date=9 February 1953 |work=Time |accessdate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite music industry scorn;&lt;ref name="Galvestonfeb53"&gt;{{cite news |title=No One Likes 'Happy Day' Except Public |author =  Richard N. Smith |date=19 February 1953  |work=[[Galveston Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cover version]]s (including one by [[Larry Hooper]] and the [[Lawrence Welk]] orchestra) were quickly rushed into production, and by 1953, there were no fewer than four hit recordings of the same song circulating, including Howard's original.

[[The Romantics]]' 1980 single "[[What I Like About You (song)|What I Like About You]]" was a sleeper hit. It was a minor hit upon its release and charted at number 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States, while not charting at all in the United Kingdom. It eventually became one of the most popular songs of the 1980s.{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=287}}

The R&amp;B singer [[Raphael Saadiq]]'s [[soul music|classic soul]]-inspired album ''[[The Way I See It]]'' was a sleeper hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sless-Kitain|first=Areif|date=6 August 2010|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/audio-file-blog/106052/raphael-saadiq-balkan-beat-box-javelin-at-lollapalooza-2010-l|title=Raphael Saadiq + Balkan Beat Box + Javelin at Lollapalooza 2010: Live review|journal=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|location=Chicago|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlooked upon its release in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2008/12/24/raphael-saadiqs/|title=Raphael Saadiq's 'The Way I See It': Most overlooked CD of the year|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=New York|date=24 December 2008|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it ended up charting for 41 weeks on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=raphael saadiq|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=Raphael Saadiq Album &amp; Song Chart History|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" by pop singer [[Lady Gaga]] were both released in early 2008 but did not become popular hits until the following year in certain countries, including the US and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HJQvMRtelYIC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=lady+gaga+poker+face+sleeper+hit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-iRMV9lku6&amp;sig=GY5Ve_mhRmezoHW4jmeEgAptFaY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwA2oVChMI96eRo4XoyAIVStNjCh060Qdd#v=onepage&amp;q=lady%20gaga%20poker%20face%20sleeper%20hit&amp;f=false Lady Gaga Superstar – Page 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Awolnation]]'s [[Sail (song)|"Sail]]" was initially released in November 2010, but entered at number 89 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in September 2011, spending 20 weeks on the chart before dropping out. The single re-entered the Hot 100 a year later, becoming a massive sleeper hit and reaching a new peak of number 17. "Sail" also became the first song to climb to its peak after a year on the Hot 100. It ultimately spent a then-record 79 weeks on the chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work?page=0,1|title=Ask Billboard: How Does The Hot 100 Work?|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British pop artist [[Ellie Goulding]]'s single "[[Lights (Ellie Goulding song)|Lights]]" was released in February 2011, first debuting on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in August of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2011-08-20|title=Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track reached its peak position of number 2 after 33 weeks in August 2012, a year and a half after the song's original release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2012-08-18|title=Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lights" continued its upward momentum from there, taking over two years to reach its peak position in countries like Slovenia, France and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slotop50.si/Glasbene-lestvice/Tedenske-lestvice/?year=2013&amp;week=11|title=SloTop50 {{!}} Tedenska lestvica največkrat zavrtenih skladb|last=SloTop50|website=www.slotop50.si|language=sl-SI|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Ellie+Goulding&amp;titel=Lights&amp;cat=s|title=lescharts.com - Ellie Goulding - Lights|last=Hung|first=Steffen|website=lescharts.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-681605|title=Offizielle Deutsche Charts - Offizielle Deutsche Charts|website=www.offiziellecharts.de|language=de-de|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The R&amp;B singer [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]]'s 2010 debut album ''[[All I Want Is You (Miguel album)|All I Want Is You]]'' performed poorly at first, debuting at number 109 on the ''Billboard'' 200 with sales of 11,000 copies,&lt;ref name="Lipshutz"/&gt; while underpromoted by his record label.&lt;ref name="Rytlewski"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rytlewski|first=Evan|date=9 October 2012|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/miguel-kaleidoscope-dream,86389/|title=Miguel: Kaleidoscope Dream|journal=[[The A.V.

[[Alessia Cara]]'s 2015 debut single, "[[Here (Alessia Cara song)|Here]]", became a sleeper hit near the end of the year, ultimately reaching number five on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and ranking high on several year-end lists of 2015's best songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Tufayel|date=10 November 2016|url=https://www.newsweek.com/conversation-alessia-cara-feminism-donald-trump-taylor-swift-519372|title=A COnversation with Alessia Cara on Feminism, Donald Trump and Taylor Swift|website=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' was a sleeper hit, launching with little fanfare in the game compilation [[The Orange Box|''The Orange Box'']], but becoming a "phenomenon",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/02/indies-take-the-cake-at-game-developers-conference/|title=Indies Take the Cake at Game Developers Conference|work=WIRED|access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prompting the development of a well-regarded sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]''.

In 2013, ''[[SteamWorld Dig]]'' launched on the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] from little-known developer [[Image &amp; Form]], but was one of the first [[Indie game]]s mentioned in a [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations|Nintendo Direct]], and sold over a million copies on all platforms.

'''Theater''' has been performed in '''Yemen''' since the early years of the twentieth century. It is, as elsewhere, a public and social genre: performances take place in cultural centers, at universities, at schools and language institutes, in public parks and squares, as well as at more intimate gatherings, such as wedding celebrations. By the count of one scholar of Yemeni theater, a minimum of five hundred plays of all kinds have been performed in Yemen over the course of the last century, around three hundred and seventy of which are by Yemeni authors; there are also around one hundred published Yemeni play scripts.&lt;ref&gt; Sayf, Yahya Muhammad. ''Al-Mukhtasar al-mufid fi al-Masrah al-arabi al-jadid:  al-Masrah fi al-Yaman (A Useful Introduction to New Arabic Theater:  Theater in Yemen.'' Arab Theater Institute, Sharjah 2009, p. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these plays have taken uniquely Yemeni themes as their subject matter:  particular moments or celebrated figures from Yemeni history, like Bilqis, the legendary [[Queen of Sheba]]; the 1962 revolution against the [[Imams of Yemen#Modern History|Hamid al-Din Imamate]] in the North; or the 1967 revolution against the British colonial forces in the South. But Yemeni performances have also drawn upon other traditions, including Egyptian drama, like the works of [[Yusuf Idris]], [[Alfred Farag]], and [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]], and on texts by European playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], and [[Luigi Pirandello]]. Performances vary in type from [[tragedy]] to [[Improvisational Theater|improvised comedy]], from [[Musical theatre|musical]] to [[experimental theater]], from [[Naturalism (theater)|naturalistic plays]] to [[theater of the absurd]].

== History ==

According to Yemeni theater historian Sa'id Aulaqi, the first play publicly performed by Yemeni actors was Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', in Arabic translation, staged in the city of Aden in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;'Aulaqi, Sa'id. ''Saba'un 'Aaman Min al-Masrah fii al-Yaman (Seventy Years of Theater in Yemen'').  Aden:  Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 1983, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare proved popular with Yemeni audiences:  subsequent decades saw performances of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]], [[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''[[Othello]]''. &lt;ref&gt; al-Asmar, Husayn.  ''al-Masraḥ fī al-Yaman:  taǧribah wa ṭumūḥ (Theatre in Yemen:  Experience and Ambition)'', Al-Manār al-‘Arabī Press, Giza 1991, p. 71; Aulaqi, Chs. 3 and 5; and Hennessey, Katherine. “Shylock in the Hadhramaut? Adaptations of Shakespeare on the Yemeni Stage”, ''Arablit'' 3:5 (Summer 2013). &lt;/ref&gt;
But Yemeni playwrights and actors also created their own texts.  Some of these plays sought to criticize the British occupying forces in Aden and the surrounding area, and to call for independence.  Others were less overtly political—romantic comedies, or dramatizations of foundational events in Islamic history.  The first full-length comedy performed in Yemeni dialect, Masrur Mabruk’s ''Tarfisha and Shorban'', took place in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Sayf, Yahya Muhammad.  ''‘Ālam al-adab wa ’l-fann al-masraḥī fī al-Yaman (Great Names in the Literature and Art of the Theater in Yemen)'', al-Hay’ah al-‘āmah lil-kuttāb, Ṣan‘ā’ 2006, p. 71. Also ’Aulaqi, p. 46. &lt;/ref&gt;
Performances in the early decades of the 20th century often took place in public squares or in schools, since no theaters ''per se'' existed.  Only men acted, as in the Elizabethan era, and some became famous for interpreting female characters.  This remained the case until 1956, when Nabiha Azim became the first Yemeni woman to appear on stage.&lt;ref&gt; Aulaqi, p. 80. &lt;/ref&gt;  It is also important to note that, in the first half of the 20th century, almost all performances occurred in the south of Yemen, most notably in Aden.  In the North, under the Imamate, theatrical performances were much rarer. 

The 1960s were a decade of revolution both North and South, and many Yemeni performances from these years took revolution as their theme, reflecting upon the military and political upheavals and the challenges of building new states and societies.&lt;ref&gt; Sa‘īd, ‘Abd al-Maǧīd Muḥammad. ''Nušūʾ wa taṭawwur al-masraḥ fī al-Yaman 1910 ilà 2000 (The Growth and Development of Theater in Yemen, 1910-2000)''.  Wazārat al-Ṯaqāfah, Ṣan‘ā’, 2010, pp. 45-49.  Also Aulaqi, Ch. 10. &lt;/ref&gt; The governments of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] and the [[South Yemen|People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (North and South Yemen respectively) demonstrated their interest in theater by establishing National Theater Troupes and supporting theater festivals. &lt;ref&gt; Aulaqi, Ch. 11. &lt;/ref&gt;
Yemeni theater faced new challenges in the 1980s as a result of economic crises and political upheaval (war in  1979 between North and South Yemen, a civil war in the South in 1986). The celebrations that greeted the unification of North and South as the Republic of Yemen in 1990 were short-lived. Civil war broke out in 1994, amidst a background of economic hardship resulting from the expulsion of Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia in the wake of the first [[Gulf War]].  Performances continued, however, both independently and under the auspices of the government, which sponsored important theater festivals in the 1990s that showcased the work of theater troupes from each of Yemen’s provinces.&lt;ref&gt; Sa‘īd, ‘Abd al-Maǧīd Muḥammad. ''Nušūʾ wa taṭawwur al-masraḥ fī al-Yaman 1910 ilà 2000 (The Growth and Development of Theater in Yemen, 1910-2000)''.  Wazārat al-Ṯaqāfah, Ṣan‘ā’, 2010.  C.f. pp. 61-75 for an analysis of the 1990 festival, pp. 77-91 for the festival in 1993, and pp. 92-106 for the one in 1995. &lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century has seen a resurgence of theater in Yemen, with foreign embassies, INGOs, and local organizations and institutes sponsoring theatrical productions. Among Yemen’s most notable contemporary actors and directors are ‘Amr Jamal and the Khalij Aden acting troupe, Amin Hazaber, Nargis ‘Abbad, Nabil Hizam, Ibrahim al-‘Ashmuri, and Saleh al-Saleh.  The [http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu ''Global Shakespeares'' webpage], hosted by MIT, recently added its first-ever page featuring a Yemeni production,  [http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/lamp-will-keep-you-company-hazaber-amin-2013/ a scene from ''Aismur Ma'ish al-Siraj,'' directed by Hazaber (2012, 2013)].

'''''Twilight's Last Gleaming''''' is a [[2014 in literature|2014]] [[novel]] by [[John Michael Greer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greer|first1=John Michael|title=Twilight's Last Gleaming|date=October 2014|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=1782200355|url=http://www.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/?MATCH=1|accessdate=15 April 2017|format=Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is a work of [[Speculative fiction|speculative]] [[political fiction]], in which a declining [[United States]] attempts to gain control of some desperately needed [[oil]] by [[Regime change|overthrowing]] the government of [[Tanzania]], prompting an intervention by Tanzania's ally, the [[People's Republic of China]], with disastrous consequences.

==Plot==
In the year 2024, significant oil reserves are discovered in the [[Indian Ocean]], in Tanzanian territorial waters. The following year, U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimson weed|Jameson Weed]] and his staff meet in the [[White House]]. The United States of the year 2025 was suffering from a long period of [[economic stagnation]], exacerbated by the effects of [[peak oil]] and [[global warming]]. Weed's plan to take control of the Tanzanian oil gets support from [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Leonard Gurney, a [[political hack]], and from [[National Security Adviser]] Ellen Harbin, a hawkish [[neocon]], but is opposed by [[Secretary of Defense]] Bill Stedman, who believes the plan is asking for trouble. Overconfident and unable to conceive of an American military defeat, the Weed administration decides to launch the operation.  Meanwhile, the president of Tanzania, knowing that the United States has [[Iraq War|a history]] of fighting for oil, senses danger and appeals to his country's ally, China, for protection.

The men of the Chinese government's inner circle, knowing that they have reached military parity with the declining United States, devise an ambitious plan to help their [[client state]] while delivering a blow to American military prestige, and they receive eager assistance from America's numerous enemies. The Chinese are able to keep their plan secret, and thus the American forces are taken by surprise when they launch the invasion in July 2025. The Chinese [[Hacker (computer security)|disable]] the American satellite network, severely hampering American command and control, then launch hundreds of high-speed computer-guided [[cruise missile]]s which they had smuggled into Tanzania. The American [[Naval fleet|fleet]] is not prepared to defend itself against this new generation of missiles.  It shoots down many of them, but as one missile after another finds its way through the ships' defenses, the fleet is devastated: most of the ships, including the [[aircraft carrier]] [[U.S.S. Ronald Reagan]], are either [[Shipwreck|sunk]] or disabled.

Meanwhile, the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] launch the invasion from [[Kenya]], the only American client state remaining in the region. The unexpected arrival of [[PLAAF|Chinese planes]] via [[Russia]] and [[Iran]] puts the Americans on the defensive. The American F-35 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] were selected for their ability to [[Crony capitalism|produce profits]] for their [[Military-industrial complex|politically connected manufacturers]] rather than their efficacy in combat, and the Chinese gain [[air superiority]]. Tanzania and several other African nations declare war on Kenya. The international press chronicles the fighting (reporters from [[Australia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] play a prominent role) but the Weed administration tries to keep the news out of American newspapers.  As the Chinese strategists had anticipated, the Americans are unable to imagine that they might actually be defeated, and therefore double down on their existing military strategy, further depleting American reserves and [[matériel]].

The Chinese and their African allies drive the American and Kenyan forces back into Kenya. With so many ships and aircraft already lost, the Americans cannot easily resupply them. The Weed administration escalates the conflict by attacking a Chinese military base directly. Aghast, Stedman resigns as Secretary of Defense. The Chinese retaliate by launching a surprise attack on the American base at [[Diego Garcia]], taking control of the island. By September, the government of Kenya had fallen, and the American forces are trapped and must [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]. Iran, with promises of a [[quid pro quo]] from the Chinese for stirring up trouble, launches an invasion of [[Saudi Arabia]], and the Americans are powerless to intervene.

Weed escalates the situation further, threatening a limited [[Tactical nuclear weapon|nuclear strike]] on the Chinese. The president of Russia responds by promising an all-out [[nuclear war]] if the United States acts on its threat. A nuclear crisis unfolds. When local authorities fire on panicked civilians trying to flee the city of [[Trenton, New Jersey]], several other states, led by [[Texas]], openly defy the federal government, implementing their own plans for surviving the crisis. Seeing his own government crumbling and no sign of concessions from Russia or China, Weed finally backs down and [[Suing for peace|sues for peace]].

Although the terms of the [[peace treaty]] only required the United States to accept the loss of Kenya and Diego Garcia, the defeat and the ongoing war between Iran and Saudi Arabia cause the price of imported oil, already high, to skyrocket, and the United States faces an [[energy crisis]]. Knowing that his [[United States Navy|navy]] is obsolete and U.S. troops in the [[Persian Gulf]] are vulnerable, Weed evacuates them, effectively shutting the U.S. out of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and the Indian Ocean. As [[investors]] around the world realize that the United States was no longer a [[hyperpower]], they begin selling U.S. dollar-denominated investments, causing the dollar to fall sharply. This leads to high [[inflation]] and a major [[economic crisis]] in the United States. The problem becomes worse when several [[Too big to fail|large]] [[investment banks]], who had taken [[Hedge (finance)|unhedged]] risks that had been intended to pay off when the United States won the war, became [[Insolvency|insolvent]]. With the dollar in free fall, the federal government cannot [[Bailout|bail out]] the banks without risking a [[Currency crisis|total collapse]] of the dollar, and so they fall into bankruptcy, and the United States enters an [[economic depression]]. Weed resigns the presidency and commits [[suicide]].

The new president, Gurney, inherits Weed's [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]], including Harbin, with whom he has begun an [[extramarital affair]]. He appoints [[United States Senate|Senator]] Pete Bridgeport as his new Vice President, as an incentive to protect the administration from [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearings]] on the military misadventure that had ruined the country. The hearings proceed anyway. Gurney's recovery plan involves a grandiose rearmament project that the United States can [[State bankruptcy|no longer afford]], and a domestic spending plan based almost entirely on [[unfunded mandates]]. The plan is universally condemned by the states and the people, and the government of [[Arkansas]] passes a resolution calling for a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to ban unfunded mandates.

Harbin, trying to protect the administration, arranges to have Stedman, the former Secretary of Defense, [[Assassination|murdered]] to prevent him from testifying before [[United States Congress|Congress]]. However, Stedman had [[Cover your ass|been aware]] of this possibility, leaving instructions for his computer-whiz grandson to [[Internet leak|leak]] his documents in case anything happens to him. The government falls into a [[crisis of legitimacy]], with [[Political dissent|anti-government rhetoric]] and donations to [[extremist]] [[Political party|political parties]] reaching new records. Other states join the call for a constitutional convention, and the convention opens in September 2026 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

At the convention, a resolution calling for a [[constitutional amendment]] to ban unfunded mandates passes easily, but the [[delegate]]s [[Polarization (politics)|cannot agree]] on anything else. After several weeks of [[Impasse|deadlock]], a proposal to dissolve the United States of America outright surfaces. The shocked delegates pass the resolution, and the convention closes.

In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Gurney and Harbin draw up plans to avert dissolution by means of a [[military coup]], drawing up a long list of people to be [[purge]]d, including Bridgeport and many other high-ranking government and military officials. The crisis comes to a head in October, when Stedman's grandson, still hacking government computers, discovers the plot and leaks it, alerting Bridgeport. As president of the Senate, Vice President Bridgeport seeks military protection from the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and convenes an emergency meeting of Congress. Gurney is [[Impeachment|impeached]], [[Conviction|convicted]], and removed from office in one day. Gurney flees the country and is killed by unknown assailants in [[Brazil]], while Harbin is imprisoned.

Bridgeport becomes President, and although he enjoys personal popularity and a reputation for [[honesty]], he cannot overcome the near-universal perception that the American government is broken beyond repair. As the dollar has lost more than 90% of its value over the past year, Bridgeport recalls all American troops home from overseas, and tries to work with Congress to [[Balanced budget|balance the budget]] with tax revenues a tiny fraction of what they had been before the war. It is too little, too late. States begin to ratify the dissolution amendment, starting with [[South Carolina]]. In January 2027, [[Nebraska]] becomes the thirty-eighth state to ratify, and the United States of America ceases to exist.

In the following weeks, the states begin to arrange themselves into a number of [[successor state]]s. In Washington, Bridgeport and other former government officials contemplate founding a [[Rump state|rump]] United States out of states that voted against ratification, based in the [[Rust Belt]] and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions.

==Speculations==
Some of the speculations that Greer made in this novel:
* The United States remained dependent on imported oil. All attempts to reduce this dependence, including domestic [[fracking]], [[biodiesel]], [[solar power]] and others, had either failed or remained economically unfeasible. [[Peak oil]] is a common theme of Greer's work.
* The United States had participated in wars in [[Ukraine]] and [[Venezuela]] in the years before the novel is set.
* Tanzania had become an [[oil exporter]] before the discovery of the offshore oil field. In 2015, Tanzania was not a significant oil producer.
* [[India]] is still a [[nuclear state]], but [[Pakistan]] is not, implying that Pakistan [[Nuclear disarmament|disarmed]] at some point.
* India and Brazil have been granted permanent seats on the [[United Nations Security Council]].
* [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] had become King of [[Great Britain]]. In 2015, William was second in line to the throne after his father, [[Prince Charles]].
* The name of the military operation, Blazing Torch, was supposedly named after the [[national flag]] of Tanzania. This design was actually on the flag of [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), not Tanzania. This could be a suggestion that the president's staffers were so overconfident or ignorant that they could not even name their plans right, although this is not addressed in the novel.
* The president of Russia bore a personal grudge against the United States, blaming it for his father's suicide during the Russian economic depression of the 1990s. 
* [[Automation]] is mentioned briefly, but mass [[technological unemployment]] has not occurred.
* The distinction between America's major political parties is portrayed as irrelevant. None of the major politicians' political affiliations are ever specified.

'''''Waterfall, Strath Creek''''' is an 1862 [[oil painting]] by Austrian artist [[Eugene von Guerard]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian - 30 December 2014 - The stories behind seven Australian paintings"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/australia-books-blog/2014/dec/30/the-stories-behind-seven-australian-paintings|title=The stories behind seven Australian paintings|last=[[Barry Pearce (curator)]]|date=30 December 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is in the collection of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Waterfall, Strath Creek, (1862) by Eugene von Guérard - The Collection - Art Gallery NSW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/OA3.1967/|title=Waterfall, Strath Creek, (1862) by Eugene von Guérard - The Collection - Art Gallery NSW|work=[[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts [[Strath Creek Falls]], a waterfall located in the [[Mount Disappointment State Forest]] in the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Government of Victoria - Imants Tillers - Panorama: A Question of Perspective - Culture Victoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cv.vic.gov.au/stories/creative-life/panorama-a-question-of-perspective/imants-tillers/|title=Imants Tillers - Panorama: A Question of Perspective - Culture Victoria|work=[[Culture Victoria]]|publisher=[[Government of Victoria]]|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1980 painting ''A waterfall (Strath Creek)''  by Australian artist [[William Delafield Cook]] that won that year's [[Wynne Prize]] identified the painting's influence as "I found the spot where he had sat to do his drawing … The waterfall was almost exactly as it was in von Guérard's picture. He was at Strath Creek on 14 January 1862; I was there 23 January 1980."&lt;ref name="Art Gallery of New South Wales - A waterfall (Strath Creek) - William Delafield Cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/65.1981/|title=A waterfall (Strath Creek) - William Delafield Cook|work=[[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 work by artist [[Imants Tillers]] titled ''Untitled (Deaf)''  used ''Waterfall, Strath Creek'' to address "the vexed issue of Australian identity"&lt;ref name="Government of Victoria - Imants Tillers - Panorama: A Question of Perspective - Culture Victoria"/&gt;
