[[File:Gentile da fabriano, adorazione dei magi.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Adoration of the Magi (Gentile da Fabriano)|''Adoration of the Magi'']], [[Gentile da Fabriano]], 1423]]

The '''Adoration of the Magi''' or '''Adoration of the Kings''' is the name traditionally given to the subject in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]] in which the [[Biblical Magi|three Magi]], represented as kings, especially in the West, having found Jesus by following a [[star of Bethlehem|star]], lay before him gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]], and worship him. It is related in the Bible by [[Matthew 2:11]]: "On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to [[Herod the Great|Herod]], they left for their own country by another path".

Christian [[iconography]] has considerably expanded the bare account of the [[Biblical Magi]] given in the second chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] ([[Matthew 2:1|2:1]]–[[Matthew 2:11|22]]) and used it to press the point that Jesus was recognized, from his earliest infancy, as king of the earth.  The scene was often used to represent the Nativity, one of the most indispensable episodes in cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' as well as the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.

In the [[church calendar]], the event is commemorated in [[Western Christianity]] as the Feast of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (January 6). The [[Orthodox Church]] commemorates the Adoration of the Magi on the [[Christmas|Feast of the Nativity]] (December 25).  The term is [[anglicized]] from the [[Vulgate]] Latin section title for this passage: '''A Magis adoratur'''.

==History of the depiction==
[[File:Adoration magi Pio Christiano Inv31459.jpg|thumb|Adoration of the Child Jesus by the three wise men or Magi; [[Sarcophagus]] relief (4th century.), Vatican]]
[[File:Jan Gossaert 001.jpg|thumb|[[The Adoration of the Kings (Gossaert)|''Adoration'' by Jan Gossaert]], c. 1510]] 
[[File:After Hieronymus Bosch - Adoration of the Magi - Petworth House.jpg|thumb|''Adoration of the Magi'' after Hieronymus Bosch]]
[[Image:Dieric Bouts 004.jpg|thumb|right| |[[Dirk Bouts]], 15th century]]

In the earliest depictions, the Magi are shown wearing Persian dress of trousers and [[Phrygian cap]]s, usually in profile, advancing in step with their gifts held out before them.  These images adapt [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] poses for barbarians submitting to an Emperor, and presenting golden wreaths, and indeed relate to images of [[tribute]]-bearers from various Mediterranean and ancient Near Eastern cultures going back many centuries.  The earliest are from [[catacomb]] paintings and [[sarcophagus]] reliefs of the 4th century.  Crowns are first seen in the 10th century, mostly in the West, where their dress had by that time lost any Oriental flavour in most cases.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;Schiller, Gertrud; Seligman, Janet (1971). ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I: Christ's incarnation, childhood, baptism, temptation, transfiguration, works and miracles,'' (English translation from German), pp. 100–114 and figs. 245–298. London: Lund Humphries. {{OCLC|59999963}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The standard Byzantine depiction of the Nativity included the journey or arrival of the mounted Magi in the background, but not them presenting their gifts, until the post-Byzantine period, when the western depiction was often adapted to an [[icon]] style.  Later Byzantine images often show small pill-box like hats, whose significance is disputed.

The Magi are usually shown as the same age until about this period, but then the idea of depicting the three ages of man is introduced: a particularly beautiful example is seen on the façade of the [[Orvieto Cathedral|cathedral of Orvieto]].  Occasionally from the 12th century, and very often in Northern Europe from the 15th, the Magi are also made to represent the three known parts of the world: Balthasar is very commonly cast as a young African or Moor, and old Caspar is given Oriental features or, more often, dress.  Melchior represents Europe and [[middle age]].  From the 14th century onward, large retinues are often shown, the gifts are contained in spectacular pieces of [[goldsmith]] work, and the Magi's clothes are given increasing attention.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;   By the 15th century, the ''Adoration of the Magi'' is often a bravura piece in which the artist can display their handling of complex, crowded scenes involving horses and camels, but also their rendering of varied textures: the silk, fur, jewels and gold of the Kings set against the wood of the stable, the straw of Jesus's manger and the rough clothing of Joseph and the shepherds.

The scene often includes a fair diversity of animals as well: the ox and ass from the [[Nativity scene]] are usually there, but also the horses, camels, dogs, and falcons of the kings and their retinue, and sometimes other animals, such as birds in the rafters of the stable.  From the 15th century onwards, the Adoration of the Magi is quite often conflated with the [[Adoration of the Shepherds]] from the account in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (2:8–20), an opportunity to bring in yet more human and animal diversity; in some compositions ([[triptych]]s for example), the two scenes are contrasted or set as pendants to the central scene, usually a [[Nativity scene|Nativity]].

The "adoration" of the Magi at the crib is the usual subject, but their arrival, called the "Procession of the Magi", is often shown in the distant background of a Nativity scene (usual in Byzantine icons), or as a separate subject, for example in the [[Magi Chapel]] frescos by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]] in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], [[Florence]].  Other subjects include the Journey of the Magi, where they and perhaps their retinue are the only figures, usually shown following the [[Star of Bethlehem]], and there are relatively uncommon scenes of their meeting with [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and the ''[[Dream of the Magi]]''.

The usefulness of the subject to the Church and the technical challenges involved in representing it have made the Adoration of the Magi a favorite subject of Christian art: chiefly painting, but also sculpture and even music (as in [[Gian-Carlo Menotti]]'s opera ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'').  The subject matter is also found in [[stained glass]].

'''''Akeelah and the Bee''''' is a 2006 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Doug Atchison]]. It tells the story of Akeelah Anderson ([[Keke Palmer]]), an 11-year-old girl who participates in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], her mother ([[Angela Bassett]]), her schoolmates, and her coach, Dr. Joshua Larabee ([[Laurence Fishburne]]). The cast also features [[Curtis Armstrong]], J.R. Villarreal, Sean Michael Afable, [[Erica Hubbard]], [[Lee Thompson Young]], Julito McCullum, Sahara Garey, [[Eddie Steeples]], and [[Tzi Ma]].

The film was developed over a period of 10 years by Atchison, who came up with the initial concept after seeing the 1994 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] and noting that a majority of the competitors came from well-off socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]] in 2000, which attracted producers [[Sid Ganis]] and [[Nancy Hult Ganis]]. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]''. [[Lionsgate Films]] undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in [[South Los Angeles]] on a budget of over $6 million.

Atchison remarked that his theme for the film, deemed an inspirational film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He also said that he wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizing the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.

Released in the United States on April 28, 2006, ''Akeelah and the Bee'' was positively received by critics and audiences. Reviewers praised its storyline and cast, lauding Palmer's performance, although a few critics panned the story as familiar and formulaic, and were critical of the portrayal of Asian-American characters. The film grossed $19 million, and received a number of awards and nominations, including the [[Black Reel Awards]] and the [[NAACP Image Award]]s. Film critics highly praised it for avoiding [[Stereotypes of African Americans|African-American stereotypes]] common in Hollywood films, while scholars were less favorable, even saying it reinforces some clichés.

==Plot==
Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old spelling enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, a predominantly [[black school]] in [[South Los Angeles|South]] [[Los Angeles]]. She lives with her disgruntled [[widow]]ed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she sign up for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee, which she initially refuses. After being threatened for detention for the remaining of the semester, she gives in, enters the spelling bee, and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old [[Mexican American]] boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] middle school.

At Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a [[Chinese American]] boy who had won second place at the past two national spelling bees. Contemptuous, he asks her to spell "[[xanthosis]]". When she starts with a "z", he tells her she needs a coach. At the conclusion of the spelling club meeting, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party. At the party, Akeelah nearly beats Dylan in [[Scrabble]]. The boy is reprimanded by his father for nearly losing to "a little black girl". After the party, Tanya is depressed over Terrence's bad behavior after getting caught by the police for acting out with his thugs, her husband's death after a criminal shot and killed him on his way home from work and concerned about her daughter's grades and frequent [[truancy]]. As she finds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she subsequently forbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee. To circumvent this prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father Samuel's signature on the consent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee. During the state bee, Tanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word. Tanya relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch, especially giving Akeelah double chores for three months as a punishment for giving it a secret behind her back. Javier protects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return. Dylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

As Christmas approaches, Akeelah goes out to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his deceased daughter Denise: being very sick caused her death and that caused his wife Patricia to move into another city. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells her that if she looked around her, she would realize that she has "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to [[Washington, D.C.]] with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to [[match fixing|intentionally lose]] by deliberately misspelling "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.

==Production==

===Writing===
Doug Atchison first had the idea of making a film about spelling bees after watching the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] of 1994 and noticing that most of the contestants had "privileged backgrounds".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}} Atchison also considered spelling bees to contain "all the drama and tension and entertainment value of a sporting event", and felt that this could be made into a film.&lt;ref name=doug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahda042406.htm |title=Interview with 'Akeelah and the Bee' Writer/Director Doug Atchison |author=Murray, Rebecca |year=2006 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QPMGnSL2?url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahda042406.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2014 |deadurl=no |pp=1–2 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=studlife&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studlife.com/archives/Cadenza/2006/04/07/AkeelahandtheBeeAnInterviewwithDougAtchison/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee: An Interview with Doug Atchison |author=Stitt, Brian |date=April 7, 2006 |work=[[Student Life (newspaper)|Student Life]] |publisher=[[Washington University in St. Louis]] |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QPafZYYE?url=http://www.studlife.com/archives/Cadenza/2006/04/07/AkeelahandtheBeeAnInterviewwithDougAtchison/ |archivedate=June 18, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this, he got the idea to write a script following the story of a child who had talent for spelling bee but was from a low-income neighborhood so did not "have access to the resources or coaching to pursue it as these other kids had."&lt;ref name=kpbs/&gt;{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}} He had the desire of making a "''[[Rocky]]''-like story" and although made it a "dramatic" plot, he declared it is "essentially a sports movie".&lt;ref name=kpbs/&gt;

Atchison started his screenplay in 1999, when he wrote a five-page [[Film treatment|treatment]] in about a month.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; In addition to the fact he was working on other projects, Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he "thought someone else would do it first." This did not happen, so he began to write by himself.&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older man (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has summarized that "the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those were always the same."&lt;ref name=doug/&gt;

===Development===
In 2000, Atchison submitted his script to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] along with about 4,500 others, in hopes of winning the [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]]. Atchison's script ended up being one of five scripts selected, and he won the grant.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/fellows/1986-present.html | title=Academy Nicholl Fellows 1986–Present | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | accessdate=June 17, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302233824/http://oscars.org/awards/nicholl/fellows/1986-present.html | archivedate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editor [[Glenn Farr]], then a member of the committee, offered to edit Atchison's film as soon as it was finished.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; Producer [[Sid Ganis]] was also attracted to the story during the award presentation ceremony.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=5}} [[Nancy Hult Ganis]], Sid's wife who was interested in public education, encouraged him to follow through with the film.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}}

The film was produced by [[Lionsgate Films]], [[2929 Entertainment]], [[Starbucks Entertainment]], Out of the Blue Entertainment, Reactor Films and Cinema Gypsy Productions,{{efn|name=companies}} with a budget around $6–8 million.&lt;ref name=ppgaz/&gt;&lt;ref name=box/&gt; However, the Ganis couple found it difficult to secure funding for the film.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} In August 2001, Danny Llewelyn's Panoptic Pictures acquired the rights of Atchison's script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/panoptic-buzzes-to-bee-1117851262/ |title=Panoptic buzzes to 'Bee' |author=Swanson, Tim |date=August 14, 2001 |work=Variety |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aCQdEfUX?url=http://variety.com/2001/film/news/panoptic-buzzes-to-bee-1117851262/ |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=wpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; --&gt;, documentary ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]'' was released and attracted attention to spelling bees, which, according to Hult Ganis, "helped us in some way".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} In November 2004, Lionsgate Films announced they would fund and distribute the film;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/lions-gate-gets-busy-on-bee-drama/ |title=Lions Gate Gets Busy on 'Bee' Drama |author=Foreman, Liza |date=November 30, 2004 |work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aCTbTVHd?url=http://www.backstage.com/news/lions-gate-gets-busy-on-bee-drama/ |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in collaboration with 2929 Entertainment they would co-finance the production.&lt;ref name=bonnet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/features/lions-gate-puts-bee-in-its-bonnet-1117914121/ |title=Lions Gate puts 'Bee' in its bonnet |author=Dunkley, Cathy |date=November 29, 2004 |work=Variety |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aB8JwN8P?url=http://variety.com/2004/film/features/lions-gate-puts-bee-in-its-bonnet-1117914121/ |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Starbucks announced a partnership with Lionsgate to market it.&lt;ref name=starbucks/&gt;

Another factor in not having a studio attached before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but Atchison felt "it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her."&lt;ref name=kpbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2006/may/04/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee |author=Accomando, Beth |date=May 4, 2006 |publisher=KPBS |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aBtNP9m4?url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2006/may/04/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionsgate's President of Production Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script, claiming that he was the only person who could do it because the story "was in his heart and in his mind".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}}

===Filming===
Filming began in February 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/bassett-on-bee-spree-1117916235/ |title=Bassett on 'Bee' spree |date=January 12, 2005 |author=Dunkley, Cathy |work=Variety |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aCiYfp8a?url=http://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/bassett-on-bee-spree-1117916235/ |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the crew filmed for ten hours a day for thirty-one days.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' [[child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]], which necessitated spending at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, "I honestly don't know how we figured it out, but we did".{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}} To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer [[M. David Mullen|David Mullen]], the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes.&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}}&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; Most of the filming took place in [[South Los Angeles]],{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=9}} which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget.&lt;ref name=rfree/&gt; Scenes were also filmed at the [[University of Southern California]], [[Hollywood Palladium]]—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and [[Venice High School (Los Angeles)|Venice High School]].{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=10}}

===Authenticity===
To bring authenticity to the film's portrayal of spelling bees, George Hornedo, who competed in spelling bees in real life, was hired to play contestant Roman and be "an unofficial technical consultant." Hornedo helped the actors to recreate "certain habits and idiosyncrasies they do on stage to help them spell."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=10}} Thus, Akeelah skipping rope to memorize the words was added as "something that was normal for the spelling bee" but Atchison tried to create it in a "subtle" way as he thought the audience could consider this unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahkp042006.htm |title=Keke Palmer Steals the Show in Akeelah and the Bee |author=Murray, Rebecca |year=2006 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QPJ2PX6b?url=http://movies.about.com/od/akeelahandthebee/a/akeelahkp042006.htm |archivedate=2014-06-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornedo and other children who had never acted before were cast because of their authentic portrayals of nervous contestants; other kids, in Atchison's eyes, were "too old in how they acted".&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; Also, [[Jacques Bailly]], who won the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1980 and is currently the contest's official pronouncer, since 2003, played himself in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1900587,00.html | title=Spelling Bee Pronouncer Jacques Bailly | author=Stephey, M.J. | date=May 26, 2009 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To further help the staff, Atchison asked Paige Kimball, director of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, to be a consultant. Kimball "was amazed at not only at how precise it was in its recreation, but also how authentic the individuals and the casting for the event was."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=10}} However, she and the organization did have some disagreements. Atchison has admitted that he originally created a more dramatic story than she wanted. However, he believed most of the disagreements were about technical procedures, "things you wouldn't even notice". For example, the children were originally sponsored by newspapers to compete, but Atchison felt this detail did not improve the story, so he removed it. There were some concerns about the screenplay, and Atchison changed some of them "because [he] thought it didn't matter one way or another so [he] just made them happy."&lt;ref name=doug/&gt;

===Music===
The film features a musical score by [[Aaron Zigman]], who wrote 45 minutes of compositions in two and a half weeks. He had planned to score ''Akeelah and the Bee'' over the holidays, but Lionsgate pushed its release date up, so Zigman was pressed for time to write the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=219 |title=Aaron Zigman - Interview |author=Goldwasser, Dan |date=February 2007 |publisher=[[Soundtrack.Net]] |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYG3XLF?url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=219 |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew inspiration from Fishburne's performance to write it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmag.com/music/aaron-zigman.html |title=An Interview With Aaron Zigman |author=Tran, Kim |work=In Magazine |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYU4iDv?url=http://www.inmag.com/music/aaron-zigman.html |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A soundtrack album consisting of 16 tracks was released by Lionsgate Records in a deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]'s [[RED Distribution]] on April 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee Soundtrack (2006) |publisher=Soundtrack.Net |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYeaQqP?url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee/ |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Lionsgate's New Tracks | author=Martens, Todd | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=April 15, 2006 | issue=15 | volume=118 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked at number 193 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and reached the 19th and sixth spot on the [[Billboard Top Independent Albums|''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums]] and Top Soundtracks respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-soundtrack-mw0000533256/awards |title=Akeelah and the Bee [Original Soundtrack] - Original Soundtrack − Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYwjVNP?url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-soundtrack-mw0000533256/awards |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original score, consisting of 37 tracks, was also released on April 4 as an [[iTunes]] exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-score/ |title=Akeelah and the Bee - Original Score (2006) |publisher=Soundtrack.Net |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYgIpbi?url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/akeelah-and-the-bee-original-score/ |archivedate=June 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/lionsgate-releases-tylers-bug-score-online_article_54690.html |title=Lionsgate releases Tyler's BUG score online |author=Larson, Randall |date=May 18, 2007 |publisher=Mania.com |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QWYqGTAn?url=http://www.mania.com/lionsgate-releases-tylers-bug-score-online_article_54690.html |archivedate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's overcoming the fear of being great, before you can be great."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=11}} Sid Ganis described it as a film "about hope and doing great things against all the odds,"{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} while a ''[[New York Press]]'' reviewer declared it "addresses the human condition".&lt;ref name=nypress/&gt;

After attending USC School of Cinematic Arts and working at a youth center in South Los Angeles,&lt;ref name=doug/&gt; Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who do well in school are said to be "[[acting white]]". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities.&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; These doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that "Spelling Bee is for someone else".&lt;ref name=bonnet/&gt; She "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy,"&lt;ref name=bonnet/&gt; and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it "empowers her to ... accomplish this task."{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=6}} Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing".&lt;ref name=ppgaz/&gt; The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing on their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all audiences "but particularly for kids [[person of color|of color]] to see a little black girl who does something powerful."&lt;ref name=ppgaz/&gt;

The director also attributed Akeelah's low-esteem and doubt of her own capacities to the public school system, where she is bullied and "her intellectual curiosity is kind of crushed".&lt;ref name=kpbs/&gt; As such, Akeelah is portrayed as an "undermotivated student",&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; who "[u]nwilling to be stigmatized as a freak or a brainiac," avoids showing her abilities.&lt;ref name=turan/&gt; According to Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the film shows "the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable environment."&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; Ann Hornaday from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Akeelah's sentence "Why would I want to represent a school that doesn't even have doors on the toilets?" is "one of the film's many subtle critiques of the country's education policies."&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt; Writing in the ''[[English Journal]]'', Amanda L. Hodges said it suggests a new approach on teaching with the "50,000 coaches" part; she declared it deconstructs the image of teachers "as those who keep order and disseminate knowledge" and shows that "[t]eaching is not an isolated activity that begins and ends at the classroom door."&lt;ref name=hodges&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Critical Close-Up: Three Films and Their Lessons in Critical Literacy | author=Hodges, Amanda L. | journal=English Journal | publisher=[[National Council of Teachers of English]] | volume=99 | issue=3 | date=January 2010 | page=73 | doi=10.2307/40503486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villarreal commented that the film "teaches you not to let your friends down",&lt;ref name=utsd/&gt; while Fishburne believed that the theme of community was important.{{Sfn|Production|2006|p=8}} Marrit Ingman of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' said the film indicates "a community-based, cooperative model of group success,"&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; while Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said it "focuses ... on the bee's community-uniting impact."&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; Hodges said Akeelah goes to the spelling bee because she recognizes it "proves that someone from their neighborhood can achieve success, and her achievement is, in a real sense, their own".&lt;ref name=hodges/&gt; In contrast, Bernard Beck wrote for ''Multicultural Perspectives'' that it depicts "the success of individual perseverance",{{sfn|Beck|2009|p=149}} while ''Red Feather Journall''{{'}}s Kathryn Linder expressed a similar opinion about individual success.{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=24}} Nevertheless, [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented "it raises important points about the ... obstacles to success that kids from poor neighborhoods face."&lt;ref name=turan/&gt; The ''New York Press''{{'}}s reviewer went further and said social class was its "real subject" as it "depicts the basics of class mobility that are routinely taken for granted".&lt;ref name=nypress/&gt; However, Chang asserted it shows the spelling bee contest as "a democratizing force",&lt;ref name=chang/&gt; while Rob Asghar, for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', wrote it treats English as "the quintessential American tool for success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060518&amp;slug=asghar18 |title=One nation, one anthem, sung in our common tongue |author=Ashgar, Rob |date=May 18, 2006 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aTAUTzk9?url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060518&amp;slug=asghar18 |archivedate=August 2, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Fishburne and Bassett also remarked that an important message of ''Akeelah and the Bee'' is to "speak properly" rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett emphasized the importance of the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees.&lt;ref name=radiofree/&gt;&lt;ref name=bassett/&gt; Atchison added that beyond learning how to spell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee "looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition."&lt;ref name=studlife/&gt; In spite of knowing its importance, it "deconstruct[s] the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman.&lt;ref name=austinc/&gt; Fishburne noted not only children but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the most important is that they should pay attention to their children's abilities.&lt;ref name=radiofree/&gt; Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents would be able to ponder if they are "push[ing] their kids to follow their own dreams and not the children's dreams."&lt;ref name=villa/&gt;

Scholars Charise Pimentel and Cathleen Sawyer from the [[Texas State University]] published an article titled "''Akeelah and the Bee'': Inspirational Story of African-American Intellect and Triumph or Racist Rhetoric Served Up On Another Platter?" on the May 2011 issue of journal ''Multicultural Perspectives''.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} On a [[critical discourse analysis]], the authors argue that despite appearing to be an "inoccent enough" film, it has major approaches that make it racist.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} First, it implies that African-Americans needs to be rescued by others;{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} second, depicts African-Americans community as "marked by homelessness, poverty, criminality, unemployment, and remnants of gang activity";{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} third, indicates that black people usually only achieve success through sports by "linking the very essence of Akeelah's phenomenal ability to spell to her rhythmic abilities";{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103}} and shows that African-Americans only can succeed outside their communities, "far from the oppressive clutches of their own."{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=104}}

Linder, on her September 2011 paper "Spelling Out Racial Difference: Moving Beyond the Inspirational Discourses in ''Akeelah and the Bee''", also criticizes it saying it "acts as a platform for a racial melodrama through which ideals of whiteness are reinforced and strengthened."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=19}} Using [[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Linda Williams]]' categories of what constitutes a racial [[melodrama]], Linder argues that it is described as an "inspirational" film because of "[its] portrayal of Akeelah's victimization by the black community that surrounds her" and of redemption only achieved "through the idealized discourse of young people's educational success as defined by dominant (white) culture."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=22}} Linder said characters "are mostly represented as having 'no interest in escape' from societal oppressions and limitations" and that "there is no sign throughout the film of any kind of lasting change for Akeelah's school or her young peers."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}}

Linder affirms that it creates a dichotomy between "success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness)."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}} Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee as the one who makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of [[African American Vernacular English]].{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that "legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual."{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} Another contraposition commented by scholars was "between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother."{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=28}} Pimental and Sawyer said she is portrayed as "an African-American obstructionist",{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103-104}} while scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of "ignorant Black woman".{{sfn|Ladson‐Billings|2009|p=93}} Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the "[[white savior narrative in film|white authority figure saves the underclass child]]" plotline by introducing Larabee,&lt;ref name=fuchs/&gt; Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103-104}}{{sfn|Ladson‐Billings|2009|p=93}} After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is "a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white culture and who can be depended on to help assimilate others".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}}

[[File:Beunans Meriasek (The life of St Meriasek) (f.56v.) Middle Cornish Saint's Play.jpg|thumb|Beunans Meriasek (f. 56 v.)]]
'''''Beunans Meriasek''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Life of Saint Meriasek'') is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] play completed in 1504. Its subject is the legends of the life of Saint [[Meriasek]] or Meriadoc, patron saint of [[Camborne]], whose veneration was popular in Cornwall, [[Brittany]], and elsewhere. It was written in the [[Cornish language]],  probably written around the same time and in the same place as ''[[Bewnans Ke]]'', the only other extant Cornish play taking a saint's life as its subject.

The manuscript of Beunans Meriasek is held in the [[Peniarth Manuscripts|Peniarth Collection]] at the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=Alan M.|title=The literature of Cornwall : continuity, identity, difference, 1000-2000|date=2000|publisher=Redcliffe Press|location=Bristol|isbn=1900178281|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Outline==
The legend of [[Meriasek]], son of a [[Duke of Brittany]], who, for love of the [[priest]]ly profession, refused marriage with a wealthy princess and led the life of a miracle-working [[hermit]], first in [[Cornwall]] and afterwards in [[Brittany|his native land]]; the legend of [[Pope Sylvester I|Saint Sylvester]], who healed the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] of [[leprosy]] by a dip in the [[baptismal font]], and then aided him in establishing [[Christianity]] throughout his broad dominion; and the curious legend of a mother who, on the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]]'s continued disregard of her [[prayer]] for the deliverance of a son in [[Hostage|captivity]], carried off the [[Christ Child]] from the arms of the Virgin's statue, and refused to yield up the baby to the Madonna until her own son was restored to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Lee Bates|Bates, K.

'''Bibliography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βιβλίον ''biblion'', "book" and -γραφία ''-graphia'', "writing"), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of [[book]]s as physical,  cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as '''bibliology'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |title=bibliology |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''). Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as objects (descriptive bibliography).

== Etymology ==
The word ''bibliographia'' (βιβλιογραφία) was used by Greek writers in the first three centuries AD to mean the copying of books by hand. In the 12th century, the word started being used for "the intellectual activity of composing books". The 17th century then saw the emergence of the modern meaning, that of description of books.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Rudolf. ''Bibliographia, an inquiry into its definition and designations''. Translated by Mathilde V. Rovelstad. Chicago, Ill.: American Library Association; Folkestone, Kent, England: Dawson, 1980. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8389-0146-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the field of bibliography has expanded to include studies that consider the book as a material object.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Bibliography. http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/sb/&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliography in its systematic pursuit of understanding the past and the present through written and printed documents describes a way and means of extracting information from this material. Bibliographers are interested in comparing versions of texts to each other rather than in interpreting their meaning or assessing their significance.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan Hardy, M. (2017). Bibliographic enterprise and the digital age: Charles Evans and the making of early American literature. ''American Literary History, 29''(2), 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field of study ==
Bibliography is a specialized aspect of [[library science]] (or [[library and information science]], LIS) and [[documentation science]]. It was established by a [[Belgian]], named [[Paul Otlet]] (1868-1944), who was the founder of the field of documentation, as a branch of the information sciences,  who wrote about "the science of bibliography."&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). ''Les sciences bibliographiques et la documentation''. Bruxelles, Institut international de bibliographie.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). "The science of bibliography and documentation"2. In Rayward, W.B. (trans. and ed.), (1990), ''International organisation and dissemination of knowledge: Selected essays of Paul Otlet''. FID, Amsterdam: Elsevier.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have recently been voices claiming that "the bibliographical paradigm" is obsolete, and it is not today common in LIS. A defense of the bibliographical paradigm was provided by Hjørland (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2007). "Arguments for 'the bibliographical paradigm'. Some thoughts inspired by the new English edition of the UDC", Information Research, 12(4) paper colis06. [Available at http://InformationR.net/ir/12-4/colis06.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantitative study of bibliographies is known as [[bibliometrics]], which is today an influential subfield in LIS.

== Branches ==
Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as physical objects (descriptive bibliography). These two distinct concepts and practices have separate rationales and serve differing purposes. Innovators and originators in the field include [[W. W. Greg]], [[Fredson Bowers]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[G. Thomas Tanselle]].

Bowers (1949) refers to enumerative bibliography as a procedure that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and  provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.

Descriptive bibliographers follow specific conventions and associated classification in their description.  Titles and title pages are transcribed in a quasi-facsimile style and representation. Illustration, typeface, binding, paper, and all physical elements related to identifying a book follow formulaic conventions, as Bowers established in his foundational opus, ''The Principles of Bibliographic Description''. The thought expressed in this book expands substantively on W. W. Greg's groundbreaking theory that argued for the adoption of formal bibliographic principles (Greg 29). Fundamentally, analytical bibliography is concerned with objective, physical analysis and history of a book while descriptive bibliography employs all data that analytical bibliography furnishes and then codifies it with a view to identifying the ideal copy or form of a book that most nearly represents the printer's initial conception and intention in printing.

In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches (enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual), Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Fredson Bowers, "Four Faces of Bibliography" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 10 (1971):33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers.

D. F. McKenzie extended previous notions of bibliography as set forth by W. W. Greg, Bowers, Gaskell and Tanselle. He describes the nature of bibliography as "the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include "non-book texts" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artifacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books [as well as other texts] how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gaskell, ''A New Introduction to Bibliography'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic works differ in the amount of detail depending on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of [[publication]]s in a particular category and analytical or critical bibliography, which studies the production of books.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, Terry.

Institut d'histoire du livre, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times, bibliography mostly focused on books.

=== Enumerative bibliography ===
[[File:Pn-samara-n-a-2000-11.jpg|thumb|Bibliographer workplace in Russia]]
An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as [[academic journal|journal]] [[article (publishing)|article]]s. Bibliographies range from "works [[citation|cited]]" lists at the end of books and articles, to complete and independent publications. A notable example of a complete, independent publication is Gow's, ''A. E. Housman: A Sketch, Together with a List of His Classical Papers'' (1936). As separate works, they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right, or computerized [[bibliographic database]]s. A [[library catalog]], while not referred to as a "bibliography," is bibliographic in nature. Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be [[tertiary source]]s.

Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.

Citation styles vary.

An entry for a book in a bibliography usually contains the following elements:
* creator(s)
* title
* place of publication
* publisher or printer
* date of publication

An entry for a journal or periodical article usually contains:
* creator(s)
* article title
* journal title
* volume
* pages
* date of publication

A bibliography may be arranged by author, topic, or some other scheme. [[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. These descriptions, usually a few sentences long, provide a summary of the source and describe its relevance. [[Reference management software]] may be used to keep track of references and generate bibliographies as required.

Bibliographies differ from [[library catalog]]s by including only relevant items rather than all items present in a particular library. However, the catalogs of some [[national library|national libraries]] effectively serve as {{illm|National bibliography|de|Nationalbibliografie|lt=national bibliographies}}, as the national libraries own almost all their countries' publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ifla.org/node/2216 |work= Ifla.org |title= National Bibliographic Register |accessdate= 1 December 2017 |publisher=[[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] |location=The Hague }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/refworks/natbib/bibprint.html |work= Help for researchers |title=National bibliographies and books in print |publisher=British Library |accessdate= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptive bibliography ===
Fredson Bowers described and formulated a standardized practice of descriptive bibliography in his ''Principles of Bibliographical Description''
(1949). Scholars to this day treat Bowers' scholarly guide as authoritative. In this classic text, Bowers describes the basic function of bibliography as, "[providing] sufficient data so that a reader may identify the book described, understand the printing, and recognize the precise contents" (124).

==== Descriptive bibliographies as scholarly product ====
Descriptive bibliographies as a scholarly product usually include information on the following aspect of a given book as a material object:
*Format and Collation/Pagination Statement&amp;nbsp;– a conventional, symbolic formula that describes the book block in terms of sheets, folds, quires, signatures, and pages
:::According to Bowers (193), the format of a book is usually abbreviated in the collation formula:
::::Broadsheet: I° or b.s. or bs.
::::Folio: 2° or fol.
::::Quarto: 4° or 4to or Q° or Q
::::Octavo: 8° or 8vo
::::Duodecimo: 12° or 12mo
::::Sexto-decimo: 16° or 16mo
::::Tricesimo-secundo: 32° or 32mo
::::Sexagesimo-quarto: 64° or 64mo
:::The collation, which follows the format, is the statement of the order and size of the gatherings.
::::For example, a quarto that consists of the signed gatherings:
:::::2 leaves signed A, 4 leaves signed B, 4 leaves signed C, and 2 leaves signed D
::::would be represented in the collation formula:
:::::4°: A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B-C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*Binding&amp;nbsp;– a description of the binding techniques (generally for books printed after 1800)
*Title Page Transcription&amp;nbsp;– a transcription of the title page, including rule lines and ornaments
*Contents&amp;nbsp;– a listing of the contents (by section) in the book
*Paper&amp;nbsp;– a description of the physical properties of the paper, including production process, an account of chain-line measurements, and a description of watermarks (if present)
*Illustrations&amp;nbsp;– a description of the illustrations found in the book, including printing process (e.g. woodblock, intaglio, etc.), measurements, and locations in the text
*Presswork&amp;nbsp;– miscellaneous details gleaned from the text about its production
*Copies Examined&amp;nbsp;– an enumeration of the copies examined, including those copies' location (i.e. belonging to which library or collector)

=== Analytical bibliography ===
This branch of the bibliographic discipline examines the material features of a textual artifact&amp;nbsp;– such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book&amp;nbsp;– to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. Analytical bibliography often uses collateral evidence&amp;nbsp;– such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc.&amp;nbsp;– to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography.&lt;ref name="New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropaedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Fredson|title=Bibliography|year=1974|edition=2nd|pages=978–981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, [[bookbinding|binding]], and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations&amp;nbsp;– and the aetiology of variations&amp;nbsp;– in a text with a view to determining "the establishment of the most correct form of [a] text (Bowers 498[1]).

== Bibliographers ==
[[File:Paul Otlet à son bureau.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Otlet]], to work in an office built at his home following the closure of the [[Mundaneum|Palais Mondial]] in June 1937]]
A ''bibliographer'' is a person who describes and lists books and other publications, with particular attention to such characteristics as authorship, publication date, edition, typography, etc. A person who limits such efforts to a specific field or discipline is a subject bibliographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitz|first= Joan M. |year=2010|url= http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx |title=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science|publisher=abc-clio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliographer, in the technical meaning of the word, is anyone who writes about books. But the accepted meaning since at least the 18th century is a person who attempts a comprehensive account—sometimes just a list, sometimes a fuller reckoning—of the books written on a particular subject. In the present, bibliography is no longer a career, generally speaking; bibliographies tend to be written on highly specific subjects and by specialists in the field.

The term ''bibliographer'' is sometimes—in particular subject bibliographer—today used about certain roles performed in libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/bib_bibliographers |title=MLA Field Bibliographers |publisher=mla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bibliographic database]]s.

== Non-book material ==
Systematic lists of media other than books can be referred to with terms formed analogously to ''bibliography'':
* [[Discography]]&amp;nbsp;– recorded music
* [[Filmography]]&amp;nbsp;–  films
* [[Webography]] (or webliography)&amp;nbsp;– websites (the first use of the word "webliography" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from June 1995)

Arachniography is a term coined by [[NASA]] research historian Andrew J. Butrica, which means a reference list of [[URL]]s about a particular subject. It is equivalent to a bibliography in a book. The name derives from ''[[arachne]]'' in reference to a spider and its web.&lt;ref name=atlantic2007&gt;{{cite book | author=Staff | page=28 | title=Encyclopedia Of Information Technology | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors | year=2007 | isbn=81-269-0752-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKenzie|first=D.

The '''DC Animated Universe''' ('''DCAU'''; also referred to as the '''Timmverse''' by fans) is the [[shared universe]] centered on a group of [[Animated series|animated television series]] based on [[DC Comics]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] from the early 1990s to mid-2000s; beginning with ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in 1992, and ending with ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p7.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greatestcartoons"&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html "The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons of All Time"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529093939/http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}. IGN. January 26, 2007. Retrieved May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the associated media franchise including [[direct-to-video]] feature films and [[Short film|shorts]], comic books, video games and other multimedia adaptations are also included in the continuity.

== List of DCAU media ==
[[File:DCAU batsuits.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Batman]]'s various character designs from the DCAU; he has been the most-featured character in this animated continuity, due to being the star of the original TV series in the DCAU.]]
While there have been several animated projects based upon DC Comics characters over the decades, what is commonly accepted as the DC animated universe consists of the stable of TV series and films that spin off from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' (1992–1995), the first TV show in this continuity. Two characters outside of the normal [[Batman]] canon, [[Zatanna]] and [[Jonah Hex]], appeared on the show, but the first series to indicate a shared continuity with other well-known characters was the subsequent show, ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', in which the [[Superman|title character]] has encounters with heroes such as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and the [[Green Lantern]].

Older shows such as ''[[Super Friends]]'' and newer shows such as ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' are not part of this continuity. The direct-to-video [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], such as ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' and ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', are also not considered part of the DCAU, despite utilizing similar character designs and several of them featuring much of the same voice cast as previous DCAU series.

An animated series based on the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comic books was planned for the DC animated universe during the mid-1990s, but was finally scrapped.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521063619/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |archivedate=May 21, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a ''Teen Titans'' series not related to the DC animated universe was released. Also, after the success of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' in the early 1990s, Fox approached producer [[Bruce Timm]] to create a spin-off series focusing on [[Catwoman]], but the project never materialized.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Feature-length films ===
The following animated feature films also are part of the DCAU continuity:

*''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' (1993; theatrical release)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ca.ign.com/articles/2010/06/25/top-25-animated-movies-of-all-time| title=''Top 25 Animated Movies of All-Time''| publisher= [[IGN]]|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm/ |title=''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''| work =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate=2008-01-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080130003635/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm/| archivedate= January 30, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (1998; direct-to-video)
*''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' (2000; direct-to-video)
*''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' (2003; direct-to-video)

&lt;!--editnote | NOTE: Do not add a series or section to the "DC animated universe" article without first reading the edit guidelines and criteria section at the top of the talk page (found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:DC_animated_universe). Any additions made will be reverted unless said guidelines are followed. Thank you!--&gt;
Before the release of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', a third animated feature based on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' was planned, entitled ''Batman: Arkham''. The film was supposed to be a follow-up for ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', and [[Boyd Kirkland]] was attached to write and direct; but the project was soon scrapped. A second ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' movie was planned for release but was finally scrapped due to the dark tones and controversies of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516063839/http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2003, during the production of ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] approached Kirkland to write a [[Catwoman]] [[direct-to-video]] feature film as a tie-in with the [[Catwoman (film)|2004 live-action film]]. Although the script was written, the project was soon scrapped after the poor reception of the live-action film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/kirkland.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010942/http://worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/kirkland.php |archivedate=May 30, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a direct-to-video feature-length animated film entitled ''Justice League: Worlds Collide'' was planned to connect ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' with its follow-up ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', but the production was finally cancelled in 2004, and the script was later rewritten for the animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', that was not part of the DC animated universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182731/http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action%3Dfullnews%26id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920221050/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=222 |archivedate=September 20, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short films ===
&lt;!-- While the Superman 75th Anniversary short does feature a few frames in the DCAU styling, please do not include it on this list. The short is an homage to Superman as a character throughout the years and not set in the canon of the DCAU --&gt;
&lt;!-- Batman Strange Days is not part of the DCAU. While it features a similar style due to being drawn by Bruce Timm, it's set in a different time period, and the character models are different. Please do not include it on this list--&gt;
*''The Dark Knight's First Night'' (1990) – A short film which acted as the developmental pilot for ''Batman: The Animated Series''.
*''[[Chase Me]]'' (2003)&amp;nbsp;– A short film with no dialogue based on ''The New Batman Adventures''.
*''Batman Black &amp; White: Two of a Kind'' (2008) - A motion comic adaptation of Bruce Timm's "Two-Face: Two of a Kind"
*''Mad Love'' (2008) - A 3 part motion comic adaptation of Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's "Batman Adventures: Mad Love"
*''Batman Beyond'' (2014) – A short film based on ''Batman Beyond'' created by [[Darwyn Cooke]] for Batman's 75th anniversary. The short features the original voice cast of the show, as well as cameos of robotic batmen from ''The New Batman Adventures'', ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Michael Keaton]]'s Batman, [[Adam West]]'s Batman, and the original comic book Batman from 1939.

=== Web cartoons ===
*''[[Gotham Girls]]'' (2000–2002)&amp;nbsp;– A [[Adobe Flash|Macromedia Flash]] web cartoon series, this was downloadable from the WB website, and featured DCAU versions of characters voiced by their original actors. A DC Comics [[miniseries]] inspired by the web series was released in 2004. All three seasons of ''Gotham Girls'' were released on the ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' DVD box set in 2008.
*''[[Lobo (DC Comics)#Webseries|Lobo]]'' (2000)&amp;nbsp;– A Flash cartoon series starring [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], the galactic bounty hunter, the web-series is a spin-off of the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' episode "The Main Man." A wax statue with the same character design as Lobo in this series appeared in an episode of ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' and he also made a reappearance in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter" briefly becoming a member of the Justice League. Both of these examples somewhat support that the webseries is part of the official DCAU, although this is still disputed. Unlike the other cartoons set in the DCAU, it has graphic violence, sexual content and strong profanity.

=== Comic books ===
{{Main article|DC animated universe (comics)}}
Many of the DCAU productions have also had [[comic book]]s created based on the characters of the various series, though their canonicity is disputable. The comics are:
&lt;!-- While some may see it as debatable that the Beyond series from 2010-2014 are canon due to their inclusion of elements from mainstream DC comics, author Kyle Higgins has stated that they "continue the animated universe" and thus should be left on the list. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Although the Shadow of Sin Tzu comics don't use the animated style, they are a follow up to the DCAU based game and thus should be left on the list. --&gt;

== Characters adapted from the DCAU ==
{{See also|List of DC animated universe characters}}

Though the DCAU is an offshoot of the mainstream DC comics universe, it has also affected the DC universe in return. The following characters were originally created for their respective series in the DCAU, but were eventually adapted via [[retroactive continuity]] into the mainstream DC comic continuity:

*[[Nora Fries]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Harley Quinn]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Renee Montoya]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Sewer King (Batman)|Sewer King]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Condiment King|The Condiment King]] (''Batman: The Animated Series'')
*[[Mercy Graves]] ''(Superman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] ''(Superman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Roxy Rocket]] ''(The New Batman Adventures)''
*[[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]]/Batman ''(Batman Beyond)''
*[[Gray Ghost (DC animated universe)|Gray Ghost]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''

;Retroactive continuity
In addition, the backstory of [[Mr. Freeze]] was adapted from his portrayal in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and the visuals and/or characterization of [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], [[Supergirl]], [[Toyman]], [[Two-Face]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Metallo]], [[Clayface]], and many others have been applied to their comic counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} On a different note, issue #22 of DC Comics' ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series, which explores alternate realities, had [[Bizarro]] transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]] patrolled by a [[Batman]] using the ''Batman Beyond'' version of the costume. A version of the future of ''Batman Beyond'' made an appearance in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #21, as part of the new Multiverse in the wake of the ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''52'', and a ''Batman Beyond'' series is planned. In January 2015, DC published ''[[The Multiversity|The Multiversity Guidebook]]'' which revealed that a universe inspired by the DCAU is Earth-12 in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], and currently in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' era, while the Justice Lords Earth from the ''Justice League'' episode "A Better World" has also been added to the canon as Earth-50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|penciller=Wyatt, Jake|title=Maps and Legends|volume=1|issue=1|date=January 28, 2015|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City|page=35|panel=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Daggett]] was adapted into the live-action film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' as a minor [[antagonist]] (renamed "John Daggett") and CEO of a rival company to Wayne Enterprises.

== The future of the DCAU ==
With the conclusion of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' animated series, Warner Bros has moved on to adapting new versions of the various DC comics properties rather than reviving the DCAU counterparts.

The last script written for DCAU continuity was titled ''Justice League: Worlds Collide''. This screenplay was created to bridge the several month gap between ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''. The draft was eventually adapted into the February 2010 film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', with the removal of any references specific to DCAU continuity, replacing Green Lantern John Stewart with Hal Jordan, and the casting of different voice actors than those of the DCAU.

In 2009, [[Bruce Timm]] was asked at a ToonZone forum if the DCAU will return in the future, and he stated this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CrTCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA517&amp;lpg=PA517&amp;dq=I+very+much+appreciate+that+so+many+of+you+guys+have+so+much+love+for+the+old+series,+from+BTAS+through+JLU+(I+do+too)+--+but+frankly,+I+doubt+that+we%27ll+be+formally,+%22officially%22+doing+another+movie+or+TV+series+set+in+that+continuity+(...)+anything+is+possible,+so+conceivably+that+could+change+someday+--+instead+of+saying+%22THE+DCAU+IS+DEAD%22,+maybe+we+can+just+say+it%27s+in+a+state+of+suspended+animation+until+further+notice...?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmuYnKz-wF&amp;sig=G1RqXQ0vAvkRHKxZtjUBUqgUea4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbvurG0r7UAhVK5SYKHY50C8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Green Lantern History: An Unauthorized Guide to the DC Comic Book Series|publisher=google.com|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Kevin Conroy said work on the DCAU had stalled because the writers ran out of ideas for stories and believed stopping was best, as they did not want to "compromise on the quality of what they had and start creating kind of silly stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonomolo|first1=Cameron|title=Kevin Conroy Reveals The Real Reason They Stopped Making ‘Batman: The Animated Series’|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/05/27/kevin-conroy-batman-animted-series-stopped-making/|website=ComicBook.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018|date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comics ===
The ''Batman Beyond'' comic series is a loose adaptation of the ''Batman Beyond'' franchise, intended to fit the character and storylines from the series into the mainstream DC continuity. The miniseries began in June 2010, under the title ''Future Evil''. In August 2010, the series was announced to continue following the completion of the first arc as an ongoing series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/08/28/batman-beyond-to-receive-an-ongoing-series/ |title=Batman Beyond To Receive An Ongoing Series |publisher=Inside Pulse |date=August 28, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; That series concluded alongside the entire line of ongoing monthly [[DC Comics]] superhero books during the 2011 revamp and relaunch, titled [[The New 52]].

''Superman Beyond'', a one-shot comic set in the same universe as ''Batman Beyond'', was released in 2011.

''Batman Beyond Unlimited'', a title chronicling the adventures of the future Justice League introduced in the DCAU, was released in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/11/14/dc-comics-launches-batman-beyond-unlimited/ |title=DC Comics Launches Batman Beyond Unlimited |publisher=DC Comics |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series published monthly triple-sized issues, containing three stories of Terry McGinnis, Clark "Cal" Kent, and the future Justice League Unlimited, respectively.&lt;ref name=june2013solicit&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics' FULL June 2013 Solicitations|url=http://www.newsarama.com/11080-dc-comics-full-june-2013-solicitations.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=July 14, 2013|quote=...don't miss the epic conclusion of Superman Beyond!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman Beyond Universe'' succeeded ''Unlimited'' in August 2013, condensing to double-monthly issues upon the elderly Superman's rejoining the future Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics' FULL August 2013 Solicitations|url=http://www.newsarama.com/17794-dc-comics-full-august-2013-solicitations.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry McGinnis was the central figure in ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'' weekly series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w.newsarama.com/21147-dc-reveals-creative-line-ups-for-september-s-futures-end-titles.html|title=DC Reveals Creative Line-Ups For September's Futures End Titles|last=Arrant|first=Chris|publisher=Newsarama|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015-2016, DC Comics and [[IDW Publishing]] released a jointly produced, six-issue miniseries comic titled ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Batman/TMNT]]'', where the ''New 52'' Batman encounters the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|IDW incarnation]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. The success of this miniseries inspired a similar crossover story, with Batman's DCAU incarnation meeting the ''Amazing Adventures'' comic version of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 CGI series']] Turtles. The concept was first announced in late July 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press |first=Official |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-classic-90s-cartoon-batman-is-teaming-up-with-the-n-1784128183 |title=The Classic '90s Cartoon Batman Is Teaming Up With the Ninja Turtles for a New Comic |publisher=io9.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is scheduled for a six-issue release starting November 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press |first=Official |url=http://batman-news.com/2016/07/22/animated-style-batmanteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-announced/|title=Animated-style Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover announced|publisher=Batman-news.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elftown''' is an Internet community or social networking site for people interested in fantasy and science fiction. It was started as the official [[Elfwood]] social networking site in February 2002 by Henrik Wallin. Later on the project separated and became more like a sister site. The split became more tangible in 2007 when Elfwood's servers moved from [[Lysator]], while Elftown's hardware remained there.

The community comprises mainly Elfwood users and other people interested in fantasy, science fiction, art or related subjects. Elftown has features such as diaries, a messaging system, a wiki, [[internet forum|forums]], guestbooks and user generated polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esarcasm.com/5710/which-social-network-is-right-for-you/|title=Which Social Network Is Right For You?|website=www.esarcasm.com|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elftown runs on small modern hardware bought by donations from its users, and is built on a unique software solution built on [[Roxen (web server)|Roxen Webserver]] and [[Pike (programming language)|Pike]]. There is an application process to become a member of Elftown. People using [[netspeak]] may be locked out.

==History==
The original plan behind Elftown was to build a site based around software designed for building [[dating site]]s as a replacement for Elfwood’s [[LiveJournal]] community. The dating site software seemed to be far more adjustable to the running  of discussion forums, the building of art galleries, and other things that interested the people of Elfwood. Elfwood had thought about using [[LysKOM]] as the software for its forums, but decided against it because many users found it too complicated. LysKOM was, however, a strong source of inspiration for the Elftown forums.

Later, a [[wiki]] was added. Elftown’s wiki is now about 20 GByte of text (mostly compressed). The wiki is filled mostly with Elftown’s members’ personal pages, galleries and chat-rooms, but there are also resources on fantasy and mythological creatures. Elftown now has functions for voting and poll creation, blogging, webpage-building (in the wiki), and a unique forum system.

In September 2004, approximately 14,000 users logged into the site, making it one of the biggest online communities in Sweden, and the third largest on Lysator. In February 2007 it had over 180,000 members. It has about 3000 unique visitors per day according to [[Google Trends]].{{when|date=January 2013}}

'''Environmental art''' is a range of artistic practices encompassing both historical approaches to nature in art and more recent ecological and politically motivated types of works.&lt;ref name=Profusion&gt;{{cite web|last=Bower|first=Sam|title=A Profusion of Terms|url=http://greenmuseum.org/generic_content.php?ct_id=306|publisher=greenmuseum.org|year=2010|accessdate=29 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203816/http://greenmuseum.org/generic_content.php?ct_id=306|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WEAD&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinman|first=Susan|title=WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory|url=http://weadartists.org|publisher=WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental art has evolved away from formal concerns, worked out with earth as a [[Sculpture|sculptural material]], towards a deeper relationship to systems, processes and phenomena in relationship to social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, J. and Wallis, B.

The term "environmental art" often encompasses "ecological" concerns but is not specific to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Linda|title=Untangling Eco from Enviro|url=http://lindaweintraub.com/blog/item/untangling-eco-from-enviro|publisher=Artnow Publications|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily celebrates an artist's connection with nature using natural materials.&lt;ref name=Profusion /&gt;&lt;ref name=WEAD/&gt; The concept is best understood in relationship to historic [[Land art|earth/Land art]] and the evolving field of [[ecological art]]. The field is interdisciplinary in the fact that environmental artists embrace ideas from science and philosophy. The practice encompasses traditional media, new media and critical social forms of production. The work embraces a full range of landscape/environmental conditions from the rural, to the suburban and urban as well as urban/rural industrial.

==History: Landscape painting and representation==

[[File:Claude Monet - Waterloo Bridge, London.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''Waterloo Bridge, London'']]
It can be argued that environmental art began with the [[Paleolithic religion|Paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]] of our ancestors. While no landscapes have (yet) been found, the cave paintings represented other aspects of nature important to early humans such as animals and human figures. "They are prehistoric observations of nature. In one-way or another, nature for centuries remained the preferential theme of creative art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/11/the-landscape-in-art-nature-in-the-crosshairs-of-an-age-old-debate/|title=The Landscape in Art: Nature in the Crosshairs of an Age-Old Debate - ARTES MAGAZINE|website=ARTES MAGAZINE|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404205809/http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/11/the-landscape-in-art-nature-in-the-crosshairs-of-an-age-old-debate/|archivedate=2016-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern examples of environmental art stem from landscape painting and representation.  When artists painted onsite they developed a deep connection with the surrounding environment and its weather and brought these close observations into their canvases. [[John Constable|John Constable's]]  sky paintings "most closely represent the sky in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Monet's [[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|London Series]]  also exemplifies the artist's connection with the environment. "For me, a landscape does not exist in its own right, since its appearance changes at every moment; but the surrounding atmosphere brings it to life, the air and the light, which vary continually for me, it is only the surrounding atmosphere that gives subjects their true value."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Challenging traditional sculptural forms==
[[File:Observatorium Robert Morris 1.JPG|thumb| [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], ''Observatorium'', Netherlands]]
[[File:Skulpturenweg Karsee Caroline Laengerer Polygonum Kugel 2.jpg|thumb|Caroline Laengerer, Poygonum-Kugel, Weide, 2002]]
The growth of environmental art as a "movement" began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  In its early phases it was most associated with sculpture—especially [[Site-specific art]], [[Land art]] and [[Arte povera]]—having arisen out of mounting criticism of traditional sculptural forms and practices that were increasingly seen as outmoded and potentially out of harmony with the natural environment.

In October 1968, Robert Smithson organized an exhibition at Dwan Gallery in New York titled “Earthworks.” The works in the show posed an explicit challenge to conventional notions of exhibition and sales, in that they were either too large or too unwieldy to be collected; most were represented only by photographs, further emphasizing their resistance to acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, Jeffrey and Wallis, Brian (1998) ''Land and Environmental Art'', London: Phaidon Press, p. 23, {{ISBN|0-7148-3514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these artists escaping the confines of the gallery and modernist theory was achieved by leaving the cities and going out into the desert.

”They were not depiciting the landscape, but engaging it; their art was not simply of the landscape, but in it as well.”&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in the late 1960s and 1970s represents an avant garde notion of sculpture, the landscape and our relationship with it. The work challenged the conventional means to create sculpture, but also defied more elite modes of art dissemination and exhibition, such as the Dawn Gallery show mentioned earlier. This shift opened up a new space and in doing so expanded the ways in which work was documented and conceptualized.&lt;ref name=Overlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippard|first=Lucy|title=Overlay: Contemporary Art and the Art of Prehistory|year=1995|publisher=The New Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-56584-238-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, artists such as [[Nils Udo]], [[Jean-Max Albert]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Becker, Sculpture Nature, Centre d'Arts Plastiques Contemporain, Bordeaux, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piotr Kowalski]],&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Kowalski, by Jean-Christophe Bailly : Éditions Hazan, Paris, 1988,&lt;/ref&gt; among others, had been creating environmental art such as [[Sculptures Bachelard]] since the 1960s.

In 1978 Barry Thomas and friends illegally occupied a vacant CBD lot in Wellington New Zealand. He dumped a truck load of topsoil then planted 180 cabbage seedlings in the shape of the word "Cabbage" for his 'vacant lot of cabbages. The site was then inundated with contributing artists' work - the whole event lasted 6 months and ended with a week long festival celebrating native trees and forests. In 2012, [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]—the country's largest cultural institution—purchased all of the cabbage patch archives citing it as 'an important part of our artistic and social history'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives | date=November 2, 2012 | first=Sarah |last=Farrar | publisher=[[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]
| url=http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation-enters-te-papas-archives/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this earlier work was mostly done in the deserts of the American west, the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s saw works moving into the public landscape. Artists like Robert Morris began engaging county departments and public arts commissions to create works in public spaces such as an abandoned gravel pit.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Herbert Bayer used a similar approach and was selected to create his [[Mill Creek Canyon Earthworks]] in 1982. The project served functions such as erosion control, a place to serve as a reservoir during high rain periods, and a 2.5 acre park during dry seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucy Lippard]]'s groundbreaking book, on the parallel between contemporary land art and prehistoric sites, examined the ways in which these prehistoric cultures, forms and images have "overlaid" onto the work of contemporary artists working with the land and natural systems.&lt;ref name=Overlay/&gt;

The expanding term of environmental art also encompasses the scope of the urban landscape. [[Agnes Denes]] created a work in downtown Manhattan ''Wheatfield - A Confrontation'' (1982) in which she planted a field of wheat on the two-acre site of a landfill covered with urban detritus and rubble. The site is now Battery Park City and the World Financial Center: morphing from ecologic power to economic power.
[[File:Paroucheva Source Energie pcp.jpg|thumb|Paroucheva Source Energie pcp]] Electric art: In 1999, the Bulgarian artist Elena Paroucheva created a new concept for the electricity pylons of  power lines.

[[Alan Sonfist]] introduced the key environmentalist idea of bringing nature back into the urban environment with his first historical Time Landscape sculpture, proposed to New York City in 1965, and visible to this day at the corner of Houston and LaGuardia in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Today Sonfist is joining forces with the broad enthusiasm for environmental and green issues among public authorities and private citizens to propose a network of such sites across the metropolitan area, which will raise consciousness of the key role that nature will play in the challenges of the 21st century. The sacredness of nature and the natural environment is often evident in the work of Environmental Artists.

Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. "Many environmental artists now desire not merely an audience for their work but a public, with whom they can correspond about the meaning and purpose of their art."&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Polli|Andrea Polli's]] installation ''Particle Falls'' made particulate matter in the air visible in a way that passersby could see.&lt;ref name=Particle&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensing Change: Particle Falls|publisher=Science History Institute|year=2013|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/particle-falls|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''HighWaterLine'' [[Eve Mosher]] and others walked through neighborhoods in at-risk cities such as [[New York City]] and [[Miami]], marking the projected flood damage which could occur as a result of [[climate change]] and talking with

[[Superstorm Sandy]] initiated numerous artists responses to New York City's forgotten waterfront and historical waterways. The exhibition, ''Silent Beaches, Untold Stories: New York City's Forgotten Waterfront'', curated by St. John's University professor, [[Elizabeth Alpert]], presented a range of artists approaches to the urban environment and complex [[ecological systems]] of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trapasso|first=Clare|title=St. John’s University exhibit sheds light on forgotten waterfront|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/exhibit-highlights-forgotten-city-waterfront-article-1.1448006|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EcoArt==

It manifests as socially engaged, activist, community-based restorative or interventionist art. Ecological artist, [[Aviva Rahmani]] believes that  "Ecological Art is an art practice, often in collaboration with scientists, city planners, architects and others, that results in direct intervention in environmental degradation. Often, the artist is the lead agent in that practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmani |first=Aviva |title=Triggering Change: A Call to Action |journal=Public Art Review |date=Spring–Summer 2013 |issue=48 |page=23 |url=http://avivarahmani.com/artistInfo/avivarah/biblio/12.pdf?1166 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222194543/http://avivarahmani.com/artistInfo/avivarah/biblio/12.pdf?1166 |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfeap.org&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous approaches to EcoArt including but not limited to:

Contributions by women in the area of EcoArt are significant, many are cataloged in WEAD, [[Women Environmental Artists Directory]] founded in 1995 by Jo Hanson, Susan Leibovitz Steinman and Estelle Akamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Jo, Leibovitz Steinman, Susan and Akamine, Estelle|title=WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory|url=http://www.weadartists.org/magazine|publisher=WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoArt definition:'''
There is discussion and debate among Ecological Artists, if Ecological Art or EcoArt, should be considered a discrete discipline within the Arts, distinct from Environmental Art. A current definition of Ecological Art, drafted collectively by the EcoArtNetwork is "Ecological Art is an art practice that embraces an ethic of social justice in both its content and form/materials. EcoArt is created to inspire caring and respect, stimulate dialogue, and encourage the long-term flourishing of the social and natural environments in which we live. It commonly manifests as socially engaged, activist, community-based restorative or interventionist art.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Sacha (2014). The practice of ecological art. [plastik] 4 . Available online at: http://art-science.univ-paris1.fr/plastik/document.php?id=866. {{ISSN|2101-0323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Artists considered to be working within this field subscribe generally to one or more of the following principles:

'''• Focus''' on the web of interrelationships in our environment—on the physical, biological, cultural, political, and historical aspects of ecological systems.&lt;br&gt;
'''• Create''' works that employ natural materials or engage with environmental forces such as wind, water, or sunlight.&lt;br&gt;
'''• Reclaim''', restore, and remediate damaged environments.&lt;br&gt;
'''• Inform''' the public about ecological dynamics and the environmental problems we face.&lt;br&gt;
'''• Revise''' ecological relationships, creatively proposing new possibilities for coexistence, sustainability, and healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISE's Beverly Naidus publishes "Arts for Change"|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/2009/04/ises-beverly-naidus-publishes-arts-for-change/|publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considering environmental impact==
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb| [[Robert Smithson]], ''Spiral Jetty'', 2005]]

[[File:Leibfriedscher Garten, 091.jpg|thumb| [[Herman de Vries|herman de vries]], ''Sanctuarium'',  Leibfriedschen Garten, Stuttgart, 2013]]
[[File:Environmental Art Balloch.JPG|thumb|Environmental Art in the woods at Balloch, Scotland]]

Within environmental art, a crucial distinction can be made between environmental artists who do not consider the possible damage to the environment that their artwork may incur, and those whose intent is to cause no harm to nature. For example, despite its aesthetic merits, the American artist [[Robert Smithson]]’s celebrated sculpture ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1969) inflicted permanent damage upon the landscape he worked with, using a bulldozer to scrape and cut the land, with the spiral itself impinging upon the lake. Similarly, criticism was raised against the European sculptor [[Christo]] when he temporarily wrapped the coastline at Little Bay, south of Sydney, Australia, in 1969.  Conservationists' comments attracted international attention in environmental circles and led contemporary artists in the region to rethink the inclinations of land art and site-specific art.

[[Sustainable art]] is produced with consideration for the wider impact of the work and its reception in relationship to its environments (social, economic, biophysical, historical, and cultural). Some artists choose to minimize their potential impact, while other works involve restoring the immediate landscape to a natural state.&lt;ref name=WEAD/&gt;

British sculptor [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] has for several decades made temporary outdoor sculptural work by rearranging natural materials found on site, such as rocks, mud and branches, which will therefore have no lingering detrimental effect. [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]] instituted a work entitled "[[Medicine Wheel]]" which was the fruit and result of a daily meditative walk, once a day, for a calendar year.  The deliverable of this work was a mandala of mosaicked found objects: nature art as [[process art]]. [[Crop art]]ist Stan Herd&lt;ref&gt;Herd, Stan (1994) ''Crop Art and Other Earthworks", New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., {{ISBN|0810925753}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows similar connection with and respect for the land.

Leading environmental artists such as the Dutch sculptor [[Herman de Vries]], the Australian sculptor [[John Davis (sculptor)|John Davis]] and the British sculptor [[Andy Goldsworthy]] similarly leave the landscape they have worked with unharmed; in some cases they have revegetated damaged land with appropriate indigenous flora in the process of making their work. In this way the work of art arises out of a sensitivity towards habitat. Perhaps the most celebrated instance of environmental art in the late 20th century was ''[[7000 Oaks]]'', an ecological action staged at Documenta during 1982 by [[Joseph Beuys]], in which the artist and his assistants highlighted the condition of the local environment by planting 7000 oak trees throughout and around the city of [[Kassel]].

==Ecological awareness and transformation==
[[File:Give-if-you-can.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacek Tylicki]] ''Give if you can – Take if you have to,'' Palolem Island, India]]

Other artists, like [[eco-feminist]] artist [[Aviva Rahmani]] reflect on our human engagement with the natural world, and create ecologically informed artworks that focus on transformation or reclamation. In the last two decades significant environmentally concerned work has been made by [[Rosalie Gascoigne]], who fashioned her serene sculptures from rubbish and junk she found discarded in rural areas. Similarly, [[Marina DeBris]] uses trash from the beach to create [[trashion]], educating people about beach and ocean trash.  [[Patrice Stellest]] created big installations with junk, but also incorporated pertinent items collected around the world and solar energy mechanisms. [[John Wolseley]] hikes through remote regions, gathering visual and scientific data, then incorporates visual and other information into complex wall-scale works on paper. Environmental art or ''Green art'' by Washington, DC based glass sculptors Erwin Timmers and [http://www.torpedofactory.org/artists/sigethy_a.htm Alison Sigethy] incorporates some of the least recycled building materials; structural glass. EcoArt writer and theoretician [[Linda Weintraub]] coined the term, "cycle-logical" to describe the correlation between recycling and psychology. The 21st century notion of artists' mindful engagement with their materials harkens back to paleolithic [[midden]] piles of discarded pottery and metals from ancient civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Linda, with Shuckmann, Skip|title=Cycle-Logical Art: Recycling Matters for Eco-Art|year=2007|publisher=Artnow Publications: Avant-Guardians Textlets on Art and Ecology|location=New York|isbn=0-9777421-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weintraub cites the work of MacArthur Fellow [[Sarah Sze]] who recycles, reuses, and refurbishes detritus from the waste stream into elegant sprawling installations. Her self-reflective work draws our attention to our own cluttered lives and connection to consumer culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sze|first=Sarah|title=Sarah Sze Selected Exhibitions|url=http://www.sarahsze.com|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sze|first=Sarah|title=At Venice Biennale, Sara Sze's 'Triple Point'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/arts/design/at-venice-biennale-sarah-szes-triple-point.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigitte Hitschler]]'s ''Energy field'' drew power for 400 red diodes from the to-be-reclaimed potash slag heap upon which they were installed, using art and science to reveal hidden [[material culture]].&lt;ref name="HYLE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hitschler |first1= Brigitte |title=Energy Field|page=16|journal= HYLE – International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |series= Chemistry in Art - A Virtual Art Exhibition Jointly Published with the Special Issue on "Aesthetics and Visualization in Chemistry" |date=2003 |volume=9 |issue=3 |url= http://www.hyperzine.de/files/downloads/hyle/files/chemistry_in_art.pdf |location=Karlsruhe, Germany |accessdate= 27 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological artist and activist, [[Beverly Naidus]], creates installations that address environmental crises, nuclear legacy issues, and creates works on paper that envision transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Beverly Naidus |url= http://weadartists.org/artist/naidusb |publisher= WEAD Women Environmental Artist Directory |accessdate= 8 February 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140221162543/http://weadartists.org/artist/naidusb |archivedate= 21 February 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her community-based permaculture project, ''Eden Reframed'' remediates degraded soil using phytoremediation and mushrooms resulting in a public place to grow and harvest medicinal plants and edible plants.

==Renewable energy sculpture==
[[File:Worldsavingmachine III.jpg|thumb|[[Ralf Sander]], ''World Saving Machine III'', MoA Museum of Art, Seoul, South Korea]]
[[Renewable energy sculpture]] is another recent development in environmental art. In response to the growing concern about global climate change, artists are designing explicit interventions at a functional level, merging aesthetical responses with the functional properties of energy generation or saving. [[Andrea Polli|Andrea Polli's]] ''Queensbridge Wind Power Project'' is an example of [[experimental architecture]], incorporating wind turbines into a bridge's structure to recreate aspects of the original design as well as lighting the bridge and neighbouring areas.&lt;ref name=Queensbridge&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queensbridge Wind Power Project

'''''Epiphany Jones''''' is the [[debut novel]] by [[Michael Grothaus]] published in June 2016. The novel is a literary thriller, social [[satire]], and [[dark comedy]] about America's obsession with sex, celebrity, and the internet, which explores a [[pornography addict]]’s unwilling relationship with a woman who thinks she can speak to God and their entanglement with sex traffickers that cater to the Hollywood elite. Grothaus has stated that his personal experiences at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and his disillusionment with the Hollywood [[film industry]] were strong inspiration for the novel.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Robin|title=Audible Interview With Michael Grothaus: Audible Sessions|url=http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Arts-Entertainment/FREE-Audible-Interview-With-Michael-Grothaus-Audiobook/B01K4TTVKG|publisher=Audible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

The novel’s protagonist is Jerry Dresden an employee at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] who suffers from a [[Pornography addiction|porn addiction]] as well as [[psychotic depression]]. Both are the result of the tragic deaths of his little sister and high-flying Hollywood father years earlier. As a result of his psychotic depression, Jerry suffers from psychotic delusions which make him see people who don’t really exist—people Jerry calls "figments". His mundane but stable life is interrupted one day when his colleague at the museum is murdered and a famous painting by [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]] (''Self-Portrait'', Spring 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-05|title=Portraits of Vincent van Gogh|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portraits_of_Vincent_van_Gogh&amp;oldid=768701711|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is stolen. Returning from work that night Jerry finds the stolen painting in his apartment and the next day he discovers that a woman who he thought was just one of his figments his entire life turns out to be a real person.

This former figment tells Jerry her name is Epiphany Jones and admits she stole the painting and killed Jerry’s colleague in order to frame him and blackmails him into helping her find someone she is looking for. Left with no choice, Jerry flees with her to Mexico, then Portugal, and finally to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France as Epiphany, which says the voice of God is speaking to her and telling her what to do, tracks down a sex trafficking ring that caters to the Hollywood elite. Along the way, Jerry discovers Epiphany is not all she seems to be as their journey grows increasingly fraught with danger and he discovers secrets about both their pasts that will change his life forever.

== Reception ==

Epiphany Jones received positive reviews in the mainstream press and on book blogs. [[The Bookseller]] described the novel as "an energetic, inventive, gritty and deeply moving thriller cum dark comedy, ''Epiphany Jones'' addresses the challenging subject of [[sex trafficking]] in a powerful narrative driven by exceptionally well-drawn, unforgettable protagonists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Lisa|title=Orenda Books signs dark comedy thriller|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/orenda-books-signs-dark-comedy-thriller-305370|website=The Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Sunday Express]] named ''Epiphany Jones'' as one of the 'Best Reads for the Summer', calling it "gloriously funny but dark as hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/686792/Holiday-book-selection-July-2016|title=Your holiday's booked: Our pick of the best reads for summer|last=|first=|date=|website=The Sunday Express|publisher=|access-date=|last1=Kerridge|first1=Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Guardian]] named it one of the best recent novels, saying ''Epiphany Jones'' is "complex, inventive and a genuine shocker, this is the very opposite of a 'comfort' read."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Laura|title=The best recent crime novels – review roundup|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/31/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Maxim Jakubowski]] called ''Epiphany Jones'' "a truly impressive debut" and "a twisting tale at the same time realistically gripping and sardonic" and praised Grothaus' writing for having "a delicate fluency which contrasts with the depravity of his subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jakubowski|first1=Maxim|title=Lovereading view...|url=https://www.lovereading.co.uk/book/16082/Epiphany-Jones-by-Michael-Grothaus.html|website=LoveReading}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Daily News]] said ''Epiphany Jones'' "is a captivating story that manages to be funny, sinister and surprising" and praised Grothaus' main characters as "complex and well-rounded—equal parts sympathetic, mad and maddening."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/epiphany-jones-sex-crimes-psychosis-dark-thriller-article-1.2764346|title='Epiphany Jones' book review: Sex crimes and psychosis in darkly funny thriller|last=Chopin|first=Allison|date=August 24, 2016|website=The New York Daily News|publisher=The New York Daily News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Going to America'''" is the final episode of the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''. It is the eighth episode of the third series and the 25th episode overall. The show's star [[Dermot Morgan]] died the day after filming was completed.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Batch 2091.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Father Kevin falls victim to depression.]]
After [[Father Ted Crilly|Ted]] prevents a [[clinical depression|depressed]] Father Kevin ([[Tommy Tiernan]]) from jumping to his death at the "It's Great Being a Priest" conference, an American priest, Father Buzz Cagney ([[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]]), asks him if he will come to a parish in [[Los Angeles]]. Ted cannot wait and excitedly tells [[Father Jack Hackett|Jack]], [[Father Dougal McGuire|Dougal]] and [[Mrs. Doyle]], who incorrectly think they will be able to come with him. Ted does not have the heart to tell them otherwise and brings them to the airport, leaving them there while he gets on the plane. However, Ted has second thoughts when Buzz mentions the gang culture around Ted's new parish in Los Angeles and its violent state. Realising he is in serious trouble, Ted abandons going on his trip and rejoins Jack, Dougal and Mrs Doyle. It transpires that the three of them never wanted to go to the States anyway, with the possible exception of Jack, who yells 'Feck!' when he learns of what has gone wrong, though the promise of a drink cheers him up. The group leaves the airport and heads for home, and Ted resigns himself to the fact he is probably never going to escape [[Craggy Island]].

===Alternate ending===
The episode was always intended to be the last ''[[Father Ted]]''; in the original script, the last scene was to be set at the "It's ''Still'' Great Being a Priest" conference with Father Kevin once again on the window ledge and once again Ted arriving on the ledge, except this time it is not to stop him from jumping but to join him, because he was depressed that the intended trip to America fell through and he would have to stay on Craggy Island forever. This ending was abandoned in favour of a montage of clips from all three series of the show, although this was not (as believed) because of the death of [[Dermot Morgan]]. Rather, the writers did not think that their original ending was very funny.

The episode was filmed on 27 February 1998, the day before Morgan died.

==Production==
This episode does not normally contain a credits sequence at the end, as it is replaced by the clips montage. The episode's guest cast is listed alongside the lead actors in the opening credits.

While filming the scene in which Ted dances to "[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]," Tommy Tiernan continually flubbed his lines. As a result, Dermot Morgan was required to perform the dance repeatedly, despite pains in his heart. In a 2009 interview, Tiernan speculated that this contributed to Morgan's fatal heart attack the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/features/interviews/TOMMY%20TIERNAN%20IN%20THE%20CHAT%20ROOM/5849883.html?|title=TOMMY TIERNAN IN THE CHAT ROOM|work=hotpress.com|last=Tyaransen|first=Olaf|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*Father Kevin is cured of his depression by listening to a cover of [[Issac Hayes]]' "[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]" by Eddie &amp; the Soul Band, before falling back into depression by the song "[[Exit Music (For a Film)]]" by [[Radiohead]].
*[[Brian Eno]] makes a brief cameo appearance in the episode as Father Brian Eno. Linehan has claimed that the idea came as "we used to see him around [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] wearing a fez."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linehan|first1=Graham|title=Twitter post|url=https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/21351832408301568|website=Twitter|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When Ted discusses a fictional [[Harrison Ford]] film with Dougal, the details mentioned are identical to those of ''Firestorm'', a fictional film previously described by characters in the American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''.

[[File:HenryFChorleya.jpg|right|frame|Drawing of Chorley, 1841]]

'''Henry Fothergill Chorley''' (15 December 1808 – 16 February 1872) was an English literary, art and music critic, writer and editor.  He was also an author of novels, drama, poetry and lyrics.

Chorley was a prolific and important music and literary critic and music gossip columnist of the mid-nineteenth century and wrote extensively about music in London and in Europe.  His opera libretti and works of fiction were far less successful.  He is perhaps best remembered today for his lyrics to "[[The Long Day Closes (song)|The Long Day Closes]]", a part song set by [[Arthur Sullivan]] in 1868.

==Life and career==
Chorley was born in Blackley Hurst, near [[Billinge, Merseyside|Billinge]], Lancashire, England.  Chorley was the youngest of four children of [[Quaker]] parents, John Chorley (1771–1816), an iron worker and lock maker, and Jane Chorley, née Wilkinson (1779–1851).  Chorley's father died, leaving his mother alone with young children.  Jane Chorley moved her family to Liverpool to help take care of her half-brother, Dr Rutter, when he became ill.  Chorley was educated by private tutors in Liverpool and then the school of the [[Royal Institution]].  His youth was shaped partly by spending time in the household of the wealthy and intellectual Mrs Benson Rathbone of [[Broughton East|Green Bank]], and he became a close friend of her son Benson, who died in an accident in 1834.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Bledsoe, Robert.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5350 "Chorley, Henry Fothergill (1808–1872)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 6 October 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/5350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism and non-fiction works===
He began working in merchants' offices, hoping to become a musician, but his uncle discouraged that as an impractical ambition.  However, Chorley soon took to musical and literary criticism.  He began to write for the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' in 1830 and remained its music and literature critic until 1868.  While there, he reviewed approximately 2,500 books&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; and wrote reviews and musical gossip columns discussing composers and performers in Britain and on the European continent.  In this position, he had much influence.  He had strongly conservative views and was a persistent opponent of innovation, but was a lively chronicler of London life.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Preface by Robin Gordon-Powell, Archivist &amp; Music Librarian of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, to the score of ''The Masque at Kenilworth'', published by The Amber Ring in 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 and 1851, Chorley edited the ''Ladies' Companion'', which covered fashion and domestic women's issues.  In the ''Athenaeum'' and elsewhere, Chorley often criticised the music of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Wagner]] for what he called "decadence".&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In addition to criticism for journals, Chorley wrote voluminously on literature and art.  His non-fiction books were widely read and included ''Music and Manners in France and Germany'' (1841), which includes a detailed description of contemporary opera in Paris and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s career in [[Leipzig]], Germany.  He expanded the German section of this book and published it 1854 as ''Modern German Music''.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern German Music – Recollections and Criticisms", ''The Times'' review, 25 April 1854, p. 8, col. B&lt;/ref&gt; His masterpiece was ''Thirty Years' Musical Recollections'' (1862), which covers, year-by-year, the opera seasons of European operas in London between 1830 and 1859.  In the work, he blames the autocratic manager of [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], Benjamin Lumley, for a decline in the quality of performances there.  On the other hand, he praises the efforts of [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Mario (tenor)|Mario]] and [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]], together with a group of journalists (including himself), for successfully creating the [[Royal Italian Opera]] at [[Covent Garden]] in 1847.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote the well-received ''Memorials of Mrs. Hemans'' (1836), ''Handel Studies'' (1859), an annotated edition [[Mary Russell Mitford]]'s letters (2 vols., 1872) and ''The National Music of the World'' (1882).

===Fiction and playwriting===
Chorley also wrote, with far less success, novels, stories, drama and verse, and various [[librettos]].  His works of fiction included ''Sketches of a Seaport Town'' (1834), a collection of stories, essays, and novellas related to Liverpool.  The next year, he wrote ''Conti the Discarded''.  Neither of these achieved success.  His plays, ''Old Love and New Fortune'' (1850) and ''Duchess Eleanour'' (1854), did not gain a following.  He wrote two novels, ''Roccabella'' (1859) and ''A Prodigy: a Tale of Music'' (1866).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  His libretti included ''The Amber Witch'' for composer [[William Vincent Wallace]], ''The May Queen – A Pastoral'' (1858) for [[William Sterndale Bennett]], and two for his friend [[Arthur Sullivan]]: ''[[The Sapphire Necklace]]'' and ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Birmingham Musical Festival", ''The Times'' review, 12 September 1864, p. 10, col. A&lt;/ref&gt; He published an English version of [[Meyerbeer]]'s ''Dinorah'', and wrote the words for several well-known songs, including [[Gounod]]'s "Nazareth",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicaustralia.org/apps/MA?function=searchResults&amp;term1=Chorley,%20Henry%20Fothergill,&amp;scope=scope&amp;parameter1=phrase&amp;location1=Anywhere Songs with English lyrics by Chorley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Loder]]'s "The Brave Old Oak" and "The Three Ages", the English form of the Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria", Sullivan's "[[The Long Day Closes (song)|The Long Day Closes]]", and the hymn "[[God, the Omnipotent!]]".

[[File:HenryFothergillChorleyBrompton01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London]]
[[File:HenryFothergillChorleyBrompton02.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Detail of monument]]
Chorley wrote the English libretto for Gounod's ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', for its first presentation in London in 1863 (at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]]).  During rehearsals, it was found that the lines were unsingable.  Both [[Sims Reeves]] and [[Charles Santley]] made strenuous and persistent complaints to Messrs. [[Chappell's]], and new translations were made secretly, since no-one dared to tell Chorley.  The first he knew of it was at the first performance.  Chorley, as reviewer, waited to make his comment until the final announced performance, of which he wrote that it was "seriously imperilled by a singular translation". Unfortunately for him, the final performance in question had not taken place, so the ''Musical World'' was able to compliment him on his poetic imagination.&lt;ref&gt;C. Pearce, ''Sims Reeves – Fifty Years of Music in England'' (Stanley Paul, London 1924), pp. 241–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Chorley's translations of several songs from ''Faust'' were published and widely performed, such as "The Flower Song", "When All Was Young" and "Glory and Love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicaustralia.org/apps/MA?function=searchResults&amp;term1=Chorley,%20Henry%20F.&amp;scope=scope&amp;parameter1=phrase&amp;location1=Anywhere Translations of Gounod songs by Chorley]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar Chorley effort, albeit of an obscure work, fared better: his translation of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] ''[[Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde]]'', which Chorley rendered as "''Son and Stranger''," for the work's London premiere in 1851&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Aldrich, Richard.

===Personality and last years===
Chorley was considered eccentric and abrasive, but he was respected for his integrity and kindness.  Chorley enthusiastically gave and attended dinner parties and was known as a big drinker.  He cultivated friendships with [[Elizabeth Barrett]] and Mendelssohn, and later [[Charles Dickens]], [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Charles Santley]], among others.  After the death of his brother, [[John Rutter Chorley]] (1806–1867), he inherited enough money to retire from the ''Athenaeum'', although he continued to contribute articles for that paper and also for ''The Orchestra''.

In spite of his efforts to promote the music of Charles Gounod in England, the composer disliked Chorley intensely.  When Gounod lived in England during the early 1870s, he wrote a satirical character piece for piano that was intended to be a parody of Chorley's personality.  It greatly amused Gounod's English patron, [[Georgina Weldon]], who described Chorley as having a "thin, sour, high-pitched sopranish voice" and moving like a "stuffed red-haired monkey."&lt;ref&gt;Harding, pp. 179–80&lt;/ref&gt; Gounod intended to publish the piece with a dedication to Chorley, but the latter died before this was possible.  Weldon then invented a new program for the piece, which was re-titled ''[[Funeral March of a Marionette]]''.  It became popular as a concert piece,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, Philip. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMwqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA1298&amp;lpg=RA1-PA1298&amp;dq=Chorley+Gounod+%22Funeral+March+of+a+Marionette%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6d0PrY3O9O&amp;sig=J8_v53FLubEEcluUuSxKAMxKWlE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result ''Programme'', Boston Symphony Orchestra]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1950s, its opening phrases became well known as the theme music for the television program ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Chris.

'''''Ibraaz''''' is an [[online]] forum for [[visual culture]] in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. 

== Publication ==
''Ibraaz'' publishes an annual online platform that focuses on research questions conceived through a network of editorial contributors based in the Middle East and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/platforms/|title=Where to Now? Shifting Regional Dynamics and Cultural Production in North Africa and the Middle East|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key editorial aim is to publish emerging writers and artists, alongside work by internationally renowned writers, academics, curators, activists, and filmmakers.

''Ibraaz'' works by posing annual ‘platforms’ where a question is put to writers, thinkers and artists about an issue relevant to the [[MENA]] region. This platform is sent to respondents both within and beyond the MENA region. Content is added to the website every month. Contributions are archived every twelve months when a new platform begins. 

''Ibraaz ''also publishes a series of books, edited by Anthony Downey, under the 'Visual Culture in the Middle East' title. To date, these have included ''Future Imperfect: Contemporary Art Practices and Cultural Institutions in the Middle East ''(Sternberg Press, 2016); ''Dissonant Archives: Contemporary Visual Culture and Contested Narratives in the Middle East ''([[I.B. Tauris]], 2015); and ''Uncommon Grounds: New Media and Critical Practices in North Africa and the Middle East'' (I.B. Tauris, 2014).

== History ==
''Ibraaz'' was set up from discussions between Anthony Downey, Kamel Lazaar and Lina Lazaar. It was founded as a research platform to rethink stereotypical frames of reference that have defined discussions around cultural production from within and beyond the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/essays/8|title=Beyond the Former Middle East|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural platform was launched as part of the 54th [[Venice Biennale]] in June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/news/1|title=Ibraaz Launch Venice|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the exhibition ''The Future of a Promise'', the largest Pan-Arab exhibition to be held at the Venice Biennale. ''Ibraaz'' Platform 001 responded to regional developments across North Africa and the Middle East, the so-called ‘[[Arab Spring]]’ and its effects upon the visual culture of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/platforms/1|title=What do we need to know about the MENA region today?|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ibraaz'' is an initiative of the [[Kamel Lazaar Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kamellazaarfoundation.org/project/ibraaz|title=Ibraaz|date=2016-09-19|work=Kamel Lazaar Foundation|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope of coverage and activities ==
''Ibraaz''’s content covers mostly contemporary visual culture from or about the Middle East and its [[diaspora]]. However, it can also include non-visual culture, such as [[Sound art|sound-based art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/projects/53|title=98weeks: Our Lines Are Now Open|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other periods, such as [[Modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/reviews/39|title=Re-Framing Modernism|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content consists of essays, interviews, reviews, artists' projects, platform responses and video contributions in its online channel.

In addition to the online platform and publications, ''Ibraaz'' organize and co-host events relating to visual culture in the Middle East. These include book launches,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://delfinafoundation.com/whats-on/book-launch-uncommon-grounds-with-ibraaz-and-ib-tauris/|title=Delfina Foundation — Book Launch: Uncommon Grounds with Ibraaz &amp; I.B. Tauris|website=delfinafoundation.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; panel discussions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/channel/57|title=Ibraaz Talks: 13th Istanbul Biennial|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the annual JAOU Tunis conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/news/120|title=JAOU Tunis 2015|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''Ibraaz'' held the conference ''Future Imperfect: Cultural Propositions and Global Perspectives'' at [[Tate Modern]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/conference/future-imperfect|title=Future Imperfect: Cultural propositions and global perspectives – Conference at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured contributors including [[Douglas Coupland]], [[Raqs Media Collective]], [[Joana Hadjithomas]] &amp; [[Khalil Joreige]], [[Zineb Sedira]], and others.

''Ibraaz'' periodically collaborates with a range of international artists and organisations, frequently publishing online exhibition catalogues and audiovisual content. Such partnerships have included with [[Asia Contemporary Art Week]]'s FIELD MEETING Take 4: Thinking Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/publications/129|title=FIELD MEETING Take 4: Thinking Practice|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; held at the [[Solomon R.

'''SÁM 66''' (''Stofnun Árna Magnússonar á Íslandi'') is an 18th-century manuscript now at the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]], [[Iceland]]. Reference information and a copy of this manuscript can be found online[1].  According to the website [1] this book was written in Iceland in 1765 and 1766. The back cover is dated 1765.  The text follows that of earlier manuscripts and printed books [2]. However the book contains a nice collection of illustrated pages on pages 73-80 (many of which are reproduced below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5298">'''[[Iceland]]ic art''' has been built on [[Western painting|northern European traditions]] of the nineteenth century, but developed in distinct directions in the twentieth century, influenced in particular by the unique [[Geography of Iceland|Icelandic landscape]] as well as by Icelandic mythology and [[Culture of Iceland|culture]].

Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of [[Þórarinn Þorláksson]], who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in [[Copenhagen]], returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Þorláksson was not the only Icelandic artist learning in Denmark at that time: there were several Icelanders, both men and women, at the Academy in the closing years of the century, and these included [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]], who together with Þorláksson created a distinctive portrayal of their home country's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style.

==Landscape painting==
The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement toward [[History of Iceland#Home rule and sovereignty|home rule and independence]], which was very active in this period. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þorláksson and Jónsson. These included [[Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval|Jóhannes Kjarval]], [[Jón Stefánsson (artist)|Jón Stefánsson]], and [[Júlíana Sveinsdóttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment.

==The emergence of abstract art==
[[Abstract art]] became prominent in Iceland in the mid-twentieth century, spearheaded by artists such as [[Svavar Guðnason]] and [[Nína Tryggvadóttir]]. However some of the country's prominent artists working in that period eschewed abstractionism, such as [[Gunnlaugur Scheving]] who instead favoured narrative content and an approach to colour and form possibly influenced by [[fauvism]] and [[cubism]]; and [[Louisa Matthíasdóttir]], based in New York, who learned from [[abstract expressionism]] but nevertheless painted from life.

==The return of figurative art==
[[Einar Hákonarson]]'s show in 1968 distinguished itself from its Icelandic art scene then current as Hákonarson’s paintings were [[Pop art|pop]], [[Figurative art|figurative]] and [[expressionistic]]. This exhibition brought the figure back into the Icelandic painting, which had been dominated by the abstract art for years.&lt;ref&gt;Visir ''23.3 1968 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakonarson said he was more influenced by feeling for nature, rather than by trying to paint a specific part of it.&lt;ref&gt;[RUV] Icelandic state TV ''interview 1976 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Icelandic art from the late twentieth century==
[[File:Iceland in April 2016 11.JPG|right|thumb|In Iceland, Ms. Emilía Björg Sigurðardóttir displayed her creation, ''Next Soil'', as part of product design art.]]
The portrayal of the landscape through visual art has remained a prominent (perhaps the most prominent) theme in Icelandic art to the present day, often reflected in the exhibitions at the country's [[National Gallery of Iceland|national gallery]]. Its 2007 summer exhibition, for example, was called "Alas Nature!" and described as an exhibition which "aims to examine nature in a different light and from a different angle from what is generally accepted".&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Iceland, ''Alas Nature!'', http://www.listasafn.is/?expand=0-114&amp;i=114&amp;root=1. Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Debate has occurred within the artistic community as to whether an appropriate balance has been struck in the support of galleries and public institutions for different media, traditions and subjects in Icelandic visual art.&lt;ref&gt;Einar Hákonarson, ''Biography'', http://www.einarhakonarson.com/bio.html. Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the Red''''' is a three-part [[BBC Two]] [[black comedy]]-[[crime drama]] 1998 series featuring [[Warren Clarke]] as BBC Reporter George Cragge and [[Alun Armstrong]] as [[Superintendent (police)|Police Superintendent]] Frank Jefferson, investigating a series of murders of London bank managers, a small political party contesting a by-election, and a plan to overthrow the [[Director-General of the BBC]].

The series was adapted by [[Malcolm Bradbury]] from [[Mark Tavener]]'s [[In the Red (novel)|novel of the same name]] ([[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]], 1989), which had been inspired by the writer's early experiences working for the [[BBC]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="RHH01"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=In the Red |publisher=''radiohaha'' |date=|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pq/radiohaha/INTHERED.html |accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conclusion of the series, the characters of Charles Prentis, played by [[Stephen Fry]], and Martin McCabe, played by [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], who also appeared in [[In the Red (radio series)|the radio adaptation of the book]] (BBC Two, 1995-1999), were featured in their own spin-off series ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]'' ([[BBC Radio 4]], 2000-2006/[[BBC Two]], 2003-2005), which was also created and written by Tavener.

'''Irving Penn''' (June 16, 1917{{spaced ndash}}October 7, 2009)&lt;ref name="Grundberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08penn.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=Irving Penn, Fashion Photographer, Is Dead at 92|last=Grundberg|first=Andy|date=2009-10-07|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American photographer known for his [[fashion photography]], [[portraits]], and [[still life]]s.  Penn's career included work at [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]], and independent advertising work for clients including [[Issey Miyake]] and [[Clinique]].  His work has been exhibited internationally and continues to inform the art of photography.

==Biography==
Penn was born to a [[Russian Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/bonnie_and_clyde_director_arthur_penn_dies_at_88_20100929/ Jewish Journal: "‘Bonnie and Clyde’ director Arthur Penn dies at 88" by Danielle Berrin] September 29, 2010 (Age 0)&lt;/ref&gt; on June 16, 1917 in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], to Harry Penn and Sonia Greenberg. Penn's younger brother, [[Arthur Penn]], was born in 1922 and would go on to become a film director and producer. Penn attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (now the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]) from 1934 to 1938, where he studied drawing, painting, graphics, and industrial arts under [[Alexey Brodovitch]]. While still a student, Penn worked under Brodovitch at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' which published several of Penn's drawings.

Penn worked for two years as a freelance designer and making his first amateur photographs before taking Brodovitch's position as the art director at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] in 1940. Penn remained at Saks Fifth Avenue for a year before leaving to spend a year painting and taking photographs in Mexico and across the US. When Penn returned to New York, [[Alexander Liberman]] offered him a position as an associate in the [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]] Art Department. Penn worked on layout for the magazine before Liberman asked him to try photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Penn|first=Irving|title=Passage|year=1991|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-40491-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn's first photographic cover for ''Vogue'' magazine appeared in October 1943. The art department of the Office of War Information in London offered him a job as an "artist-photographer" but he volunteered with the [[American Field Service]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d22dvihj4pfop3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2017/05/01152009/AFS-Janus-2010-January.pdf|title=AFS Janus - January 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Naples with a boatload of American troops in November 1944. Penn drove an ambulance in support of the [[British Eighth Army]] as it alternately waited out weather and slogged its way north through a miserable winter in the Italian [[Apennines]]. In July 1945, he was transferred from Italy to India. He photographed the soldiers, medical operations, and camp life for the AFS, and various subjects while bivouacked in India. He sailed back to New York in November 1945.

Penn continued to work at ''Vogue'' throughout his career, photographing covers, portraits, still lifes, fashion, and photographic essays. In the 1950s, Penn founded his own studio in New York and began making advertising photographs.  Over the years, Penn's list of clients grew to include [[General Foods]], [[De Beers]], [[Issey Miyake]], and [[Clinique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenough|first=Sarah|title=Irving Penn Platinum Prints|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10906-7|pages=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn met Swedish fashion model [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] at a photo shoot in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Irving Penn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/6272245/Irving-Penn.html|date=2009-10-08|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mightypenn&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mighty Penn|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguedaily/2009/10/the-mighty-penn/|date=July 2007|work=Vogue|author=Fraser, Kennedy|df=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the two married at [[Chelsea Register Office]], and two years later Lisa gave birth to their son, Tom Penn, who would go on to become a metal designer.&lt;ref name=mightypenn /&gt; Lisa Fonssagrives died in 1992. Penn died aged 92 on October 7, 2009&lt;ref&gt;https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/irving-penn-92-is-dead/?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; at his home in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08penn.html ''New York Times'' obituary by Andy Grundberg, October 8, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"/&gt;

==Photography==
Best known for his fashion photography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gan|first=Vicky|title=Iconic Photography by the Legendary Irving Penn Comes to the American Art Museum|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/iconic-photography-by-the-legendary-irving-penn-comes-to-the-american-art-museum-25926352/|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn's repertoire also includes portraits of creative greats; ethnographic photographs from around the world; [[Modernist]] still lifes of food, bones, bottles, metal, and found objects; and photographic travel essays.&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quintana"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurría-Quintana|first=Angel|title=Irving Penn retrospective|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1a5c191a-1ce5-11df-aef7-00144feab49a.html#axzz2qhTe2IjK|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn was among the first photographers to pose subjects against a simple grey or white backdrop and he effectively used it's simplicity.&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|title=Irving Penn, 92: Fashion, Celebrity Photographer Found Beauty in the Commonplace|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/07/AR2009100703848.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=8 October 2009|author2=Rees-Shapiro, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quintana"/&gt;  Expanding his austere studio surroundings, Penn constructed a set of upright angled backdrops, to form a stark, acute corner. Subjects photographed with this technique included [[Martha Graham]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

Penn's still life compositions are sparse and highly organized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jffrank.com/home/latest/london-photography-exhibitions-7-january-2016/|title=London Photography Exhibitions January 2016|date=2016-01-07|newspaper=jfFrank online|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; assemblages of food or objects that articulate the abstract interplay of line and volume. Penn's photographs are composed with a great attention to detail, which continues into his craft of developing and making prints of his photographs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Photography Exhibitions November 2017|url=https://www.jffrank.com/home/latest/london-photography-exhibitions-november-2017/|website=jfFrank online|publisher=jfFrank|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Penn experimented with many printing techniques, including prints made on aluminum sheets coated with a platinum emulsion rendering the image with a warmth that untoned silver prints lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenough|first=Sarah|title=Irving Penn Platinum Prints|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10906-7|pages=5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His black and white prints are notable for their deep contrast, giving them a clean, crisp look.

While steeped in the Modernist tradition, Penn also ventured beyond creative boundaries. The exhibition ''Earthly Bodies'' consisted of series of posed nudes whose physical shapes range from thin to plump; while the photographs were taken in 1949 and 1950, they were not exhibited until 1980.

==Major collections==

The Art Institute of Chicago holds the Irving Penn Paper and Photographic Archives, which were donated to the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries and the Department of Photography in 1995. In addition, the Art Institute of Chicago has more than 200 of Penn's fine art prints in its collection, and has mounted several exhibitions of work by the artist including the retrospective ''Irving Penn: A Career in Photography'' (1997–98) which traveled internationally as well as ''Irving Penn: Underfoot'' (2013).

The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM)]] possesses a large collection of Penn's works, including a silver gelatin print of Penn's ''The Tarot Reader'', a photograph from 1949 of [[Jean Patchett]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Bridget Bate Tichenor|Bridget Tichenor]].&lt;ref name="Irving Penn"&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=19489 The Tarot Reader (Jean Patchett and Bridget Tichenor) - New York 1949 by Irving Penn SAAM]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the museum received 100 images as a gift from the Irving Penn Foundation, significantly increasing the number of Penn's works in the collection to 161 images.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Southall (August 9, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/irving-penn-photographs-to-bolster-smithsonian-collection/ Irving Penn Photographs to Bolster Smithsonian Collection] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irving Penn Foundation's gift forms the basis of the exhibition, ''Irving Penn: Beyond Beauty'', which is on view at SAAM before traveling to other museum venues around the United States.&lt;ref name=beyondbeauty /&gt;

==Quotations==
:"Photographing a cake can be art." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photo-seminars.com/Fame/irving_penn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209043128/http://www.photo-seminars.com/Fame/irving_penn.htm |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A good photograph is one that communicates a fact, touches the heart, and leaves the viewer a changed person for having seen it; it is in one word, effective." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn.

:"Sensitive people faced with the prospect of a camera portrait put on a face they think is one they would like to show the world. ...Very often what lies behind the facade is rare and more wonderful than the subject knows or dares to believe." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn, 1975.

:"I found pictures trying to show peoples in their natural circumstances generally disappointing [but] feel secure in the artificial circumstances of the studio [accepting] for myself a stylization that I felt was more valid than a simulated naturalism." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L., “Ethnographic Portraits, 1967-71.” Pp. 212-219, 366-367.

'''''Jammin' on the Avenue''''' is an [[outdoor sculpture]] by American artist [[John Spaulding (artist)| John Spaulding]]. It is located on the border of the [[Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI) campus, which is near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], at the intersection of [[Indiana Avenue]], North Street, and Blackford Street. The historic [[Lockefield Gardens]] apartments flank the sculpture to its back. [[Madame Walker Theatre Center]] is located across the street.&lt;ref name=JazzArt&gt;Organissimo Jazz Discussion Forum, "Jazz Art." November 2, 2009. http://www.organissimo.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=19326&amp;mode=threaded&amp;pid=355339&lt;/ref&gt; This sculpture is documented in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] database, which is the inspiration for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?view=grid&amp;dsort=&amp;date.slider=&amp;fq=data_source%3A%22Art+Inventories%22&amp;q=jammin+on+the+avenue|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture!

==Description==
The sculpture is a collage of brass wind instruments welded together and arranged in a square column.&lt;ref&gt;Discover Indiana Avenue, "Outdoor Art." November 2, 2009. http://www.discoverindianaavenue.com&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments consist of [[saxophone]]s, [[sousaphone]]s, [[trombone]]s, [[trumpet]]s, and [[tuba]]s. The sculpture sits in a fountain basin, which has non-chlorinated running water and illumination for the sculpture. The fountain basin is a large trapezoidal shape and the sculpture is set in its most central point. The basin is made of cement and tile.  The dimensions of the sculpture are 9'6" × 4' × 4'. The dimensions of the fountain basin are approximately 26" × 35'6" × 70'.&lt;ref&gt;SIRIS Database, "Jammin' on the Avenue."

==Information==
''Jammin' on the Avenue'', fabricated in 1989, was commissioned by the Sexton Companies. The sculpture stands at the south entrance to the new section of Lockefield Gardens.&lt;ref name=Greiff&gt;{{cite book | last =Greiff | first =Glory-June | title =Remembrance, Faith &amp; Fancy: Outdoor Public Sculpture in Indiana | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press | year =2005 | location =Indianapolis | pages =169&amp;ndash;70 | isbn =0-87195-180-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute to the rich [[jazz]] and musical heritage that was a part of the Indiana Avenue cultural district.&lt;ref name=JazzArt/&gt;

==Location history==
The location of  ''Jammin' on the Avenue'' reflects the spirit of this sculpture. It faces [[Indiana Avenue]] and the [[Madame Walker Theatre Center]] to remind all those who pass of the rich cultural heritage that was and still is a part of this area near the IUPUI campus. The sculpture's location in front of Lockefield Gardens is also significant because the artist was born here. Lockefield Gardens was a public housing project built in 1938. New construction has been added to seven surviving historic buildings, which have been renovated, to create the Lockefield Gardens apartment complex. The sculpture can be found at the south entrance to the complex, which is home to IUPUI students, staff, faculty, and anyone who want to live in this historic and cultural tapestry. Another Spaulding sculpture, ''[[Untitled (Jazz Musicians)]]'', stands nearby on West Street, across form the Madame Walker Theater Center.&lt;ref name=Greiff/&gt;

== Documentation ==
A [[Museum Studies]] course at IUPUI in collections care and management recently undertook the project of researching and reporting on the condition of 40 outdoor sculptures on the university campus. This documentation was influenced by the successful [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]], a 1989 campaign organized by Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation in partnership with the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]. Throughout the 1990s, over 7,000 volunteers in the U.S. have cataloged and assessed the condition of more than 30,000 publicly accessible statues, monuments, and sculptures installed as outdoor public art across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/Sos/aboutsos.htm|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture!

'''Japanische Kampfhörspiele''', formed in 1998, is a [[grindcore]] band from [[Krefeld, Germany]]. Their name translates to "Japanese Combat Radio Plays." On later releases, they incorporated some [[death metal]] influences, but the band referred to their sound as "grindpunk". They played their farewell concert on January 29, 2011, at the Feierwerk in [[München]], a recording of which formed their final release, the DVD ''Abschiedskonzert''. A reunion followed in 2014.

== History ==
Japanische Kampfhörspiele was founded in 1998 by Klaus Nicodem and Christof Kather. Their debut CD was released in 2001 on Blutwurscht Productions. The band then added Daniel and Simon Schaffrath and Marco Bachmann to the line-up for live performances. In 2002, Japanische Kampfhörspiele released ''Die Großstadt Stinkt, Ist Laut Und Septisch''. Simon Schaffrath left the band, and the band stopped playing live. The band focused on song-writing, and in 2003 Bastardized Recordings released the EP ''Fertigmensch''. The band played its first live show in October 2003.

In spring 2004 the band went into the studio again to record ''Hardcore Aus Der Ersten Welt''. Japanische Kampfhörspiele continued to record and release their music through various labels, the last being ''Kaputte Nackte Affen'' on Unundeux Records.

'''''L'Atelier Rouge''''', also known as '''''The Red Studio,''''' is a painting by [[Henri Matisse]] from 1911, in the collection of [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78389|title=Henri Matisse. The Red Studio. Issy-les-Moulineaux, fall 1911 {{!}} MoMA|last=|first=|date=|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/775426] ''Matisse and "The Red Studio",'' Robert F. Reiff, Art Journal, Vol. 30, No. 2 (Winter, 1970-1971), pp. 144-147, retrieved online December 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''L'Atelier Rouge'' came in at No. 5 in a poll of 500 art experts voting for the most influential of all works of [[modern art]], along with works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref&gt;1 December 2004 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm "Duchamp's urinal tops art survey"] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal Analysis ==
This work depicts Matisse's ''[[atelier]]'' (studio) that he had built for himself in 1909, entirely awash in one tone of vibrant, rusty red. At 64 inches by 51 inches, the interior still life successfully accomplishes a monumentality while also seeming inviting. Unassertive yellow lines create the outlines of Matisse's furniture, creating objects out of the expansive red space. A grandfather clock sits approximately in the center of the composition, serving as a vertical axis that brings balance and harmony to the spatial discontinuities of the studio. The paintings and objects within the room, seemingly suspended in the sea of red, establish a sense of spatial depth by creating angles and perspective in an otherwise flat picture. They also give the eye a place to rest and bring a sense of harmony to the colors. Most of the objects are painted with whites, blues, and greens, colors that contrast and balance the thinly-applied red paint. There is also a tabletop that dominates the bottom left corner of the canvas, jutting out from the edge as if the viewer were next to it and looking down from a corner of the room. The spatial discontinuities of the table, the objects in the room, the chairs on the right side of the canvas, and the window on the left wall give the sense that this is the artist's environment, dominated by creativity and color more than laws of natural order.&lt;ref name="moma" /&gt;

== Influences ==
If one was to put ''L'Atelier Rouge'' in the chronology of Matisse's artistic production, it would land immediately after his Fauvist paintings. Created in 1911, the work is a singular, culminating expression of several key aspects of Matisse's artistic development up to that point. That is to say, the painting reflects the influence of [[Fauvism]], [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], his early travels abroad, and his own emerging artistic code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the red that dominates the canvas is evocative of his earlier work ''[[The Dessert: Harmony in Red (The Red Room)|The Dessert: Harmony in Red]]'' (1908), yet it also illustrates compelling differences: exaggerated forced perspective, thinner washes of color, and a pared down composition. These differences are indicative of Matisse's growing concern with "a) the orchestration of pure colors and b) the search for a stable composition with the simplest means."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, the painting bears the influence of Impressionism in its lack of focal point, but it is clear that focal point was abandoned in favor of the compositional balance and harmony Matisse so desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of the Western World: From Greece to Post-modernism|last=Cole|first=Bruce|last2=Gealt|first2=Adelheid|last3=Wood|first3=Michael|publisher=Summit Books|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the expressive use of color and forced perspective is comparable to Post-Impressionist [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[The Night Café]]'', yet once again it is clear how Matisse adapted these elements to his own aesthetic interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''L'Atelier Rouge'', the expressive use of color and lack of focal point work together to create harmony and balance. Even [[Fauvism]], a style which Matisse himself developed with other artists in Paris, leaves its mark on the work in the use of bold color and disdain for realistic, representational painting.

Matisse also made several significant trips just prior to the creation of ''L'Atelier Rouge''. He visited an Islamic exhibition in [[Munich]]; the [[Moors|Moorish]] cities of [[Seville]], [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], and [[Granada]] in Spain; and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Watkins. "Matisse, Henri." ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online.'' Oxford University Press, accessed March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; One can see how this impacted the development of his aesthetic, as his tones and decorative motifs become more exotic–almost playful in his experimentation with forms and colors.

== Legacy ==
Matisse's technique in ''L'Atelier Rouge'' to use just one bold, rich color to create the entirety of the composition–by strategically using the absence of the red–would significantly impact the succeeding generations of [[Modernism|Modern]] artists. This accomplishment is considered by some a direct precursor to [[Color Field painting|color field painting]], best exemplified by artists such as [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Kenneth Noland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Sooke, "Matisse." In ''Modern Masters''. BBC. September 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, upon closer inspection, the pale "lines"—that carve the objects out of the red space and dictate the perspective of the room—are not lines at all. Rather, the lines themselves are constructed by the absence of the red paint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is to say, Matisse originally painted the canvas a pale yellow. He then painted over that color with a thinly applied rusty, rich red, leaving thin bands of the under-color to serve as line. This same approach can be seen in works by [[Frank Stella]], although he left bands of raw canvas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, the technique of layering color to establish depth or perspective—without formal use of line—serves as a crux for most of [[Color Field painting|color field painting]].

'''Light art''' or '''luminism'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fi/books?id=vyiiW3uL49sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22light%20art%22&amp;f=false Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[applied arts|applied art]] form in which [[light]] is the main medium of expression.  It is an art form in which either a [[sculpture]] produces [[light]], or light is used to create a "sculpture" through the manipulation of light, colours, and shadows. These sculptures can be temporary or permanent, and can exist in two distinctive spaces: indoor galleries, such as museum exhibits, or outdoors at events like festivals. Light art can be an interaction of light with in an architectural space. Light artists are those that devote all their creative experimentation to light art, some artists experiment with light and neon signage and use light in their practice.

The first examples of modern light art appeared after the discovery of electric lighting made longterm lighting safe and affordable at the end of the 19th century. Light art however didn't become a dedicated form of art until the late 20th century, due in large part due to pioneering work begun in 1969, as part of an experimental program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, by Robert Irwin and James Turrell.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;Glenn Shrum, [http://www.archlighting.com/projects/light-art-matters_o Light Art Matters - A closer look at the ideas behind the work]&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Modernism, Constructivism and the Bauhaus (1920–1935)===
{{see also|Modern art|Constructivism (art)|Bauhaus}}
Light has been used for architectural effect throughout human history. However, the modern concept of light art emerged with the development of artificial electric [[Incandescence|incandescent]] [[light sources]] and experimentation by [[modern art]]ists of the Constructivist and Bauhaus movements.&lt;ref name=Weibel /&gt; "''Prounenraum'' (''Proun Room'') (1923), by [[El Lissitzky]], is considered by many art historians to be the first time an artist incorporated architectural lighting elements as a component integral to his work."&lt;ref name=gs /&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/08/replicas-and-reconstructions-in-twentieth-century-art | title=Replicas and Reconstructions in Twentieth-Century Art: El Lissitzky, Prounenraum 1923, reconstruction 1971 | publisher=Tate | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}} The first object-based light sculpture was the ''Light-Space Modulator'' (1922-1930), by [[László Moholy-Nagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080613012021/http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-06-13 | title=László Moholy-Nagy, Tate bio | publisher=tate.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunstlexikon" /&gt;&lt;!--This list of examples needs to be drawn from the list of a reliable source. Karl Popper gives such a list for "neon artists"--&gt; Experimentation and innovations in theatrical light have often influenced other areas of light use such as light art. The development of Modernism and the electric light go hand-in-hand; the idea of the modern city with high-rises and electric light epitomizes this development.

All visual art uses light in some form, but in modern [[photography]] and [[motion pictures]], use of light is especially important. However, with the invention of electrical [[artificial light]], possibilities expanded and many artists began using light as the main form of expression, rather than solely as a vehicle for other forms of art. [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] [[Naum Gabo]] experimented with the transparent materiality light reflects on an object; his ''Linear Construction No. 1'' (1943) provides an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gabo-linear-construction-no-1-t00191 | title=Linear Construction No. 1 1942–3 | publisher=Tate | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Duchamp's]] ''Hat Rack'' (1916 and 1964), hangs from the ceiling and casts a shadow against the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hat Rack {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|url = http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/73661|website = www.artic.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Hilarie M. Sheets explains that "the interplay of dark and light has been a theme running from Greek and Roman sculpture to Renaissance painting to experimental film. But as technology advanced from the glow of the electric light bulb to the computer monitor, artists have been experimenting with actual light as material and subject."&lt;ref&gt;Sheets, Hilarie M.

===Projection mapping===
{{see also|Projection mapping}}

Closely associated art forms are projectors, 3-D map projection, multi-media, video art, and photography where light technology ''projects'' images rather than using light as the medium. Large light festivals and events have helped to develop the use of light on large canvases such as architectural facades, building projections, the flood lighting of buildings with colour, and interactive media facades. These forms of light art have their antecedents in new media-based, video art and photography which are sometimes classified as light art since light and movement are important to the work.

===Digital graffiti===
{{see also|Digital graffiti}}

Also included in the light art genre is the so-called [[light graffiti]] including projection onto buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weburbanist.com/2007/09/07/architectural-light-graffiti-projection-bombing-images-on-urban-surfaces | title=Architectural Light Graffiti: Image Projection Bombing | publisher=Webist Media | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrangement of lighted windows in buildings, and painting with hand-held lights onto film using time exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weburbanist.com/2008/12/07/light-graffiti-art-photos | title=Luminaries: 20 Light Graffiti Artists &amp; Photographers | publisher=Webist Media | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light Art Installation ===
An example of a light art installation was that of artists [[Mel and Dorothy Tanner]], who began adding light to their paintings and sculptures at their studio in Miami, Florida in 1967. This was the same time period as that of [[Light and Space]] artists [[James Turrell]] and [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]] in Los Angeles, on the opposite U.S. coast. The Tanners worked very closely for over 40 years until Mel Tanner died in 1993. Their main project was the creation of ''Lumonics'' that consists of their light sculptures, live projection, video, electronics and music as a total [[Installation art|art installation]]. Author and art historian, [[Michael Betancourt]] described this conceptual art as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] in his book, ''The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel &amp; Dorothy Tanner''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel and Dorothy Tanner|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|publisher=Wildside Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8095-1193-2|location=Maryland, United States:|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' published in 2004. Dorothy Tanner, born in 1923, continues her light art from her studio in Denver, and co-directs the Lumonics School of Light Art with Marc Billard.

===Museums===
Many modern [[art museum]]s include light sculptures and installations in their permanent and temporary collections.  The [[Centre for International Light Art]] in [[Unna]], [[Germany]] is currently the world's only museum dedicated exclusively to the collection and presentation of light art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/take-an-electrifying-look-inside-the-worlds-first-light-art-museum | title=Take An Electrifying Look Inside The World's First Light Art Museum | publisher=Vice Media Inc. | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://light2015blog.org/2014/08/08/only-light-museum-grants-international-light-art-award/ | title=The World’s Only Light Art Museum Grants the International Light Art Award 2015 | publisher=International Year of Light 2015 - Blog | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Light Art Museum in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]], another museum dedicated to the display of light art, closed on December 5, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://luminapolis.com/en/2010/11/closed-the-light-art-museum-in-eindhoven/|title=Closed: The Light Art Museum in Eindhoven|date=November 28, 2010|work=Luminapolis: The World of Lighting|accessdate=2016-01-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; due to insufficient funding, but at the [[Strijp-S]] complex, one can see the '''Fakkel''' by Har Hollands, [[Daan Roosegaarde]]'s '''Crystal''' as well as part of the light festival '''[[GLOW Festival Eindhoven|GLOW]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/extra/glow/herbeleef-glow-eindhoven-routes-en-hoogtepunten-door-de-jaren-heen-1.4075747 Herbeleef Glow Eindhoven: Routes en hoogtepunten door de jaren heen]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/extra/glow/licht-zien-voelen-en-zelfs-opslaan-op-glow-next-1.4615697 Licht zien, voelen en zelfs opslaan op Glow Next]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many well-known art museums, such as the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, often have temporary light art exhibits and installations in their galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/jim-campbell/|title=Jim Campbell|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/31?locale=en|title=Take your time: Olafur Eliasson {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/press/release/sfmoma-celebrates-artist-leo-villareal-in-anticip/|title=SFMOMA CELEBRATES ARTIST LEO VILLAREAL IN ANTICIPATION OF LIGHT INSTALLATION ON BAY BRIDGE|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light festivals===
Light festivals and the smart city LED revolution was driven by outdoor urban light sculpture with low energy LED [[light fixture|luminaires]]. Light artists were able to create new exhibition spaces collectively in the form of light art festivals. These festivals have continued to grow internationally and help to highlight ecological change. This LED low energy movement dates back to the 2009 by the Vivid Smart Light Festival in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartlightsydney.org/ | title=Smart Light Sydney | publisher=Smart Light Sydney | accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Singapore, the [[i Light Marina Bay]] festival—Asia's only sustainable light festival—was first hosted in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=i Light Marina Bay invites artists to submit proposals|url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/news/2015/apr/pr15-21.aspx|publisher=Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many light art festivals, especially in Europe, including the [[Signal Festival]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Ghent]] Light Festival. Light festivals and LEDS have redefined light art as an art genre.&lt;ref&gt;"SuperLux: Smart Light Art, Design &amp; Architecture for Cities" published by Thames and Hudson Author Davina Jackson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light Art Awards===
The International Light Art Award, presented by the Centre for International Light Art Unna and the RWE Foundation, is given to up-and-coming artists who will contribute "to the development of light art in an innovative and creative way"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilaa.eu/en/the-award|title=International Light Art Award|last=NL,|first=Zentrum für Internationale Lichtkunst Unna // Design: RAW COLOR, Eindhoven,|website=www.ilaa.eu|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in existence since 2015.

The award is meant to encourage artists to explore light art, despite the difficulties the relatively new style faces, including the financial and technical requirements needed for a light art exhibit.  The foundations behind the ILAA also wish to put emphasis on [[sustainability]] and new technologies within the medium of light expression.

The Australian and New Zealand Engineering Illumination Society ANZIES began giving an annual award to light artists at the Vivid Light Festival in 2010.  
Vivid Light festival grants help support local and international light artists in the pursuit of their medium.
2015 The DARC awards, supported by Mondo Arc Magazine, began selecting winners for their light art awards.
The International Association of Lighting Design the IALD, a North American-based organization, also gives out an annual award for light art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7093">A '''studio potter''' is one who is a modern artist or artisan, who either works alone or in a small group, producing unique items of [[pottery]] in small quantities, typically with all stages of manufacture carried out by themselves.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Emmanuel Cooper, ''Ten Thousand Years of Pottery''. [[British Museum Press]], 2000. {{ISBN|0-7141-2701-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Studio pottery]] includes functional wares such as [[tableware]], [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]] and non-functional wares such as [[sculpture]].  Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium.

'''''Mystical Marriage of St Catherine and Saints''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Lorenzo Lotto]], signed, now in the Collections of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica ([[Palazzo Barberini]]), [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

==Description==
The work was commissioned by the merchant Felice Cassotti from Lotto while the latter was working in Bergamo. The painting hung in the nuptial bedroom of Cassotti's son. The work is signed on the Madonna's throne. The painting once hung in the [[Palazzo Quirinale]].

Lotto in 1523 had painted a portrait of the married couple, Marsilio Cassotti and Faustina Assonica, a work now on display in the [[Prado Museum]]. In this depiction of the [[Mystical marriage of Saint Catherine|mystical marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], the saint kneeling accepts from the child Jesus a rose, the latter symbol of love and martyrdom; in her left hand is a marital ring. Hanging from a sash is a purse with the name of Christ; the sash has a medallion with an angel holding a balance. Around these figures are St Jerome paging his bible, with lion at the feet (left lower corner); St George dressed as a knight with his lance (left upper corner); beside him hovering behind the Virgin is St Sebastian with an arrow; Saint Nicholas of Myra with a bishop's crozier with three gold spheres, conversing with St Anthony Abbot with bells (right upper corner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/103/lotto-sposalizio-mistico-di-santa-caterina-e-santi Galleria Barberini], entry on painting.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other Lotto paintings, the figures seem engaged in movement.

'''''New Essays on Human Understanding''''' ({{lang-fr|Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain}}) is a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] of [[John Locke]]'s major work, ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. It is one of only two full-length works by Leibniz (the other being the [[Théodicée|''Theodicy'']]). It was finished in 1704 but Locke's death  was the cause alleged by Leibniz to withhold its publication. The book appeared some sixty years later.&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres philosophiques'', latines et françoises&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;, de feu Mr. de Leibnitz, tirées de ses manuscrits, qui se conservent dans la bibliothèque royale à Hanovre, et publiees par Rud. Eric Raspe, Amsterdam et Leipzig, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many philosophical works of the time, it is written in [[dialogue]] form.

==Overview==
The two speakers in the book are Theophilus ("loving God" in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qeo%2Ffil-os&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qeo%2Ffil-os0 "θεόφιλος"]. ''[[LSJ]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who represents the views of Leibniz, and Philalethes ("loving truth" in Greek),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=filalh%2Fqhs&amp;la=greek "φιλαλήθης"]. ''[[LSJ]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who represents those of Locke. The famous rebuttal to the empiricist thesis about the provenance of ideas  appears at the beginning of ''Book II'': "Nothing is in the mind without being first in the senses, except for the mind itself".&lt;ref&gt;Book II, Ch. 1, §2: "''Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu excipe: nisi ipse intellectus''".&lt;/ref&gt; All of Locke's major arguments against innate ideas are criticized at length by Leibniz, who defends an extreme view of innate cognition, according to which all thoughts and actions of the soul are innate.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Leibniz, ''New Essays on Human Understanding''. Translated and edited by Peter Remnant and Jonathan Bennett. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1981, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his discussion of innate ideas, Leibniz offers penetrating critiques of Locke's views on personal identity, free will, mind-body dualism, language, necessary truth, and Locke's attempted proof of the existence of God.

{{About|the painting by Edward Hopper}}
{{Infobox artwork/wikidata}}

'''''Nighthawks''''' is a 1942 oil on canvas painting by [[Edward Hopper]] that portrays people in a downtown [[diner]] late at night.

It has been described as Hopper's best known work&lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers and Harold Osborne (Eds.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1997 (second edition), p. 273, {{ISBN|0-19-860084-4}} "The central theme of his work is the loneliness of city life, generally expressed through one or two figures in a spare setting - his best-known work, Nighthawks, has an unusually large 'cast' with four."&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most recognizable paintings in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/hoppers-nighthawks.html Hopper's Nighthawks], [[Smarthistory]] video, accessed April 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/22/edward-hopper-birthday_n_1692024.html | title=Happy Birthday, Edward Hopper! | publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | work=The Huffington Post | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=May 5, 2013 | author=Brooks, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within months of its completion, it was sold to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] on May 13, 1942 for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;The sale was recorded by Josephine Hopper as follows, in volume II, p. 95 of her and Edward's journal of his art: "May 13, '42: Chicago Art Institute - 3,000 + return of Compartment C in exchange as part payment. 1,000 - 1/3 = 2,000." See Deborah Lyons, ''Edward Hopper: A Journal of His Work.'' New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the painting==

===Josephine Hopper's notes on the painting===
Starting shortly after their marriage in 1924, Edward Hopper and his wife Josephine (Jo) kept a journal in which he would, using a pencil, make a sketch-drawing of each of his paintings, along with a precise description of certain technical details. Jo Hopper would then add additional information about the theme of the painting.

A review of the page on which ''Nighthawks'' is entered shows (in Edward Hopper's handwriting) that the intended name of the work was actually '''''Night Hawks''''' and that the painting was completed on January 21, 1942.

Jo's handwritten notes about the painting give considerably more detail, including the possibility that the painting's title may have had its origins as a reference to the beak-shaped nose of the man at the bar, or that the appearance of one of the "nighthawks" was tweaked in order to relate to the original meaning of the word:

{{quote|Night + brilliant interior of cheap restaurant. Bright items: cherry wood counter + tops of surrounding stools; light on metal tanks at rear right; brilliant streak of jade green tiles 3/4 across canvas--at base of glass of window curving at corner. Light walls, dull yellow ocre [sic] door into kitchen right.

Very good looking blond boy in white (coat, cap) inside counter. Girl in red blouse, brown hair eating sandwich. Man night hawk (beak) in dark suit, steel grey hat, black band, blue shirt (clean) holding cigarette. Other figure dark sinister back--at left. Light side walk outside pale greenish. Darkish red brick houses opposite. Sign across top of restaurant, dark--Phillies 5c cigar. Picture of cigar. Outside of shop dark, green. Note: bit of bright ceiling inside shop against dark of outside street--at edge of stretch of top of window.&lt;ref&gt;See Deborah Lyons, Edward Hopper: A Journal of His Work. New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1942, Jo confirmed her preference for the name. In a letter to Edward's sister Marion she wrote, "Ed has just finished a very fine picture--a lunch counter at night with 3 figures. Night Hawks would be a fine name for it. E. posed for the two men in a mirror and I for the girl. He was about a month and half working on it."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Hopper, letter to Marion Hopper, January 22, 1942. Quoted in Gail Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography.'' New York: Rizzoli, 2007, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership history==
[[File:Nighthawks invoice Ed Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|Invoice showing $1,971 going to the artist after commission and costs]]

Upon completing the canvas in the late winter of 1942, Hopper placed it on display at Rehn's, the gallery at which his paintings were normally placed for sale. It remained there for about a month. On St. Patrick's Day, Edward and Jo Hopper attended the opening of an exhibit of the paintings of [[Henri Rousseau]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], which had been organized by Daniel Catton Rich, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Rich was in attendance, along with [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred Barr]], the director of the Museum of Modern Art. Barr spoke enthusiastically of ''[[Gas (painting)|Gas]]'', which Hopper had painted a year earlier, and "Jo told him he just had to go to Rehn's to see ''Nighthawks''. In the event it was Rich who went, pronounced ''Nighthawks'' 'fine as a [[Winslow Homer|Homer]]', and soon arranged its purchase for Chicago."&lt;ref&gt;Gail Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography.'' New York: Rizzoli, 2007, pp. 351-2, citing Jo Hopper's diary entry for March 17, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale price was $3,000. The painting has remained in the collection of the Art Institute ever since.

==Location of the restaurant==
The scene was supposedly inspired by a diner (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper himself said the painting "was suggested by a restaurant on [[Greenwich Avenue]] where two streets meet." Additionally, he noted that "I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger."&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, interview with [[Katharine Kuh]], in ''The Artist's Voice: Talks with Seventeen Modern Artists''. 1962. Reprinted, New York: Da Capo Press, 2000, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

This reference has led Hopper aficionados to engage in a search for the location of the original diner. The inspiration for this search has been summed up on the blog of one of these searchers: "I am finding it extremely difficult to let go of the notion that the Nighthawks diner was a real diner, and not a total composite built of grocery stores, hamburger joints, and bakeries all cobbled together in the painter's imagination."&lt;ref name="Moss 1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeremiah Moss |url=http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/06/finding-nighthawks-coda.html |title=Jeremiah's Vanishing New York: Finding Nighthawks, Coda |work=[[Jeremiah's Vanishing New York]] |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot usually associated with the former location is a now-vacant lot known as [[Mulry Square]] at the intersection of Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Avenue and West 11th Street, about seven blocks west of Hopper's studio on Washington Square. However, according to an article by Jeremiah Moss in ''[[The New York Times]]'', this cannot be the location of the diner that inspired the painting as a gas station occupied that lot from the 1930s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Moss 2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moss |first=Jeremiah |title=Nighthawks State of Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/opinion/05moss.html?_r=1&amp;hp |work=The New York Times |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss located a land-use map in a 1950s municipal atlas showing that "Sometime between the late '30s and early '50s, a new diner appeared near Mulry Square." Specifically, the diner was located immediately to the right of the gas station, "not in the empty northern lot, but on the southwest side, where Perry Street slants." This map is not reproduced in the ''Times'' article but is shown on Moss's blog.&lt;ref name="Moss blog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moss |first=Jeremiah |title=Finding Nighthawks, Part 3 |url=http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/06/finding-nighthawks-part-3.html |work=Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (blog) |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss comes to the conclusion that Hopper should be taken at his word: the painting was merely "suggested" by a real-life restaurant, he had "simplified the scene a great deal," and he "made the restaurant bigger." In short, there probably never was a single real-life scene identical to the one that Hopper had created, and if one did exist, there is no longer sufficient evidence to pin down the precise location. Moss concludes, "the ultimate truth remains bitterly out of reach."&lt;ref name="Moss 1"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Roger Brown - Puerto Rican Wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]]'s ''Puerto Rican Wedding'' (1969). Brown said that the café in the lower left corner of this painting "isn't set up like an imitation of ''Nighthawks'', but still refers to it very much."&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{in popular culture|date=November 2018}}

Because it is so widely recognized, the diner scene in ''Nighthawks'' has served as the model for many homages and parodies.

===Painting and sculpture===
Many artists have produced works that allude or respond to ''Nighthawks''.

Hopper influenced the [[Photorealism|Photorealists]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including [[Ralph Goings]], who evoked ''Nighthawks'' in several paintings of diners. [[Richard Estes]] painted a corner store in ''People's Flowers'' (1971), but in daylight, with the shop's large window reflecting the street and sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Levin | first=Gail | contribution=Edward Hopper: His Legacy for Artists | year=1995 | editor-last=Lyons | editor-first=Deborah | editor2-last=Weinberg | editor2-first=Adam D. | title=Edward Hopper and the American Imagination | publisher=W.

More direct visual quotations began to appear in the 1970s. [[Gottfried Helnwein]]'s painting ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'' (1984) replaces the three patrons with American pop culture icons [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[James Dean]], and the attendant with [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3799.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704114730/http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3799.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 4, 2009 |title=Boulevard of Broken Dreams II |publisher=Helnwein.com |date=October 15, 2013 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hopper scholar Gail Levin, Helnwein connected the bleak mood of ''Nighthawks'' with 1950s American cinema and with "the tragic fate of the decade's best-loved celebrities."&lt;ref name="Levin, 109–110"&gt;Levin, 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nighthawks Revisited'', a 1980 parody by [[Red Grooms]], clutters the street scene with pedestrians, cats, and trash.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 116–123.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 [[Banksy]] parody shows a fat, shirtless [[soccer hooligan]] in [[Union Flag]] boxers standing inebriated outside the diner, apparently having just smashed the diner window with a nearby chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Jury | first=Louise | title=Rats to the Arts Establishment | newspaper=The Independent | date=October 14, 2005 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/rats-to-the-arts-establishment-319534.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Several writers have explored how the customers in ''Nighthawks'' came to be in a diner at night, or what will happen next. [[Wolf Wondratschek]]'s poem "Nighthawks: After Edward Hopper's Painting" imagines the man and woman sitting together in the diner as an estranged couple: "I bet she wrote him a letter/ Whatever it said, he's no longer the man / Who'd read her letters twice."&lt;ref&gt;Gemünden, 2–5, 15; quotation translated from the German by Gemünden.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote interior monologues for the figures in the painting in her poem "Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, 1942".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Updike |first= John |chapter= Hopper's Polluted Silence |title= Still Looking: Essays on American Art |publisher= Knopf |place= New York |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-4000-4418-9 |page= 181}}. The Oates poem appears in the anthology {{Citation | editor-last = Hirsch | editor-first = Edward | editor-link = Edward Hirsch | title = Transforming Vision: Writers on Art | place = Chicago, Illinois | publisher = Art Institute of Chicago | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8212-2126-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special issue of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' included five brief dramatizations that built five different plots around the painting; one, by screenwriter Christof Schlingensief, turned the scene into a chainsaw massacre.  [[Erik Jendresen]] and [[Stuart Dybek]] also wrote short stories inspired by this painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gemünden, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://christinajaniczek.com/review.html|title= Book Review: Coast of Chicago by Stuart Dybek|last1=Janiczek|first1=Christina|date=December 5, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Hopper was an avid moviegoer and critics have noted the resemblance of his paintings to [[film still]]s. ''Nighthawks'' and works such as ''Night Shadows'' (1921) anticipate the look of [[film noir]], whose development Hopper may have influenced.&lt;ref name="Gemunden"&gt;{{Citation | last=Gemünden | first=Gerd | title=Framed Vsions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination | publisher=University of Michigan Press | place=Ann Arbor | year=1998 | isbn=0-472-10947-2 | pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doss"&gt;{{Citation|last=Doss |first=Erika |title=Edward Hopper, Nighthawks, and Film Noir |journal=Post Script: Essays in Film and the Humanities |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=14–36 |year=1983 |format=PDF |url=http://www.colorado.edu/finearts/erikadoss/articles/postscriptessay.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016091540/http://www.colorado.edu/finearts/erikadoss/articles/postscriptessay.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hopper was an acknowledged influence on the film musical ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' (1981), for which production designer Ken Adam recreated ''Nighthawks'' as a set.&lt;ref&gt;Doss, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Wim Wenders]] recreated ''Nighthawks'' as the set for a film-within-a-film in ''[[The End of Violence]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Gemunden"/&gt; Wenders suggested that Hopper's paintings appeal to filmmakers because "You can always tell where the camera is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berman |first=Avis |title=Hopper |journal=Smithsonian |url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/july/hopper.php?page=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711045932/http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/july/hopper.php?page=4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 11, 2007 |volume=38 |issue=4 |page=4 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), two characters visit a café resembling the diner in a scene that illustrates their solitude and despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Arouet | first=Carole | title=Glengarry Glen Ross ou l’autopsie de l’image modèle de l’économie américaine | journal=La Voix du Regard | issue=14 | year=2001 | url=http://www.voixduregard.org/14-Aurouet.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928150036/http://www.voixduregard.org/14-Aurouet.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=September 28, 2007 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was also briefly used as a background for a scene in the animated film ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' (1973) by director [[Ralph Bakshi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://agentpalmer.com/2367/media/movies/rotospective-ralph-bakshis-heavy-traffic-is-high-on-detail-consistency-and-realism/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nighthawks'' also influenced the "future noir" look of ''[[Blade Runner]]''; director [[Ridley Scott]] said "I was constantly waving a reproduction of this painting under the noses of the production team to illustrate the look and mood I was after".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Sammon, Paul M. | title=Future Noir: the Making of Blade Runner | publisher=HarperPrism | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=0-06-105314-7 | page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the 1998 film ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] noted that the film had "store windows that owe something to Edward Hopper's ''Nighthawks''."&lt;ref name="Dark City"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebertfest.com/two/dark_city_rev.htm|title=Dark City|work=ebertfest.com|access-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930110156/http://www.ebertfest.com/two/dark_city_rev.htm|archive-date=September 30, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]'' (2005) acknowledged a similar debt by setting one scene at a "Nighthawks Diner" where a character purchases a T-shirt with ''Nighthawks'' printed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chambers |first=Bill |contribution=Hard Candy (2006), The King (2006) |title=Film Freak Central |url=http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/hardcandyking.htm |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235810/http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/hardcandyking.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale model===
A number of [[model railroad]]ers, most notably [[John Armstrong (model railroader)|John Armstrong]], have recreated the scene on their layouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=And Now for Something Completely Different|url=http://ogrforum.ogaugerr.com/topic/and-now-for-something-completely-different-1|website=O Gauge Railroading On-Line Forum|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater lighting manufacturer [[Electronic Theatre Controls]] has a human sized scale model of the diner in the lobby of their headquarters in Middleton, Wisconsin. It is used as a reception area for the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.etcconnect.com/tag/nighthawks/ "Secrets of ETC’s Town Square"]. Et Cetera, [[Electronic Theatre Controls]]. Retrieved October 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
Some editions of the [[board game]] ''[[Masterpiece (game)|Masterpiece]]'' contain ''Nighthawks'' as one of the paintings.

===Parodies===
''Nighthawks'' has been widely referenced and parodied in popular culture. Versions of it have appeared on posters, T-shirts and greeting cards as well as in comic books and advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 125–126.  {{Citation &lt;!--news--&gt; | last = Reynolds | first = Christopher | title = Lives of a Diner | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | pages = E25 | date = September 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these parodies—like Helnwein's ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'', which became a popular poster&lt;ref name="Levin, 109–110"/&gt;—retain the diner and the highly recognizable diagonal composition but replace the patrons and attendant with other characters: animals, [[Santa Claus]] and his reindeer, or the cast of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' or ''[[Peanuts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 125–126; Thiesen, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

One parody of ''Nighthawks'' even inspired a parody of its own. Michael Bedard's painting ''Window Shopping'' (1989), part of his ''[[Sitting Ducks]]'' series of posters, replaces the figures in the diner with ducks and shows a crocodile outside eying the ducks in anticipation. Poverino Peppino parodied this image in ''Boulevard of Broken Ducks'' (1993), in which a contented crocodile lies on the counter while four ducks stand outside in the rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Müller | first1 = Beate |url = | title = Parody: Dimensions and Perspectives | publisher = Rodopi | place = | volume = | edition = | year = 1997 | isbn=904200181X | chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Sirius Radio]] host [[Howard Stern]], featured a parody on his website entitled ''Wack Pack Diner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirius.comwww.howardstern.com/uploads/FanZoneDownloadModel/87/image/broken-dreams-copy.original.jpg|title=The Official Site of Howard Stern - HowardStern.com|work=Howard Stern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015212858/http://www.sirius.comwww.howardstern.com/uploads/FanZoneDownloadModel/87/image/broken-dreams-copy.original.jpg|archivedate=October 15, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''One &amp; Other''''' was a public art project by [[Antony Gormley]], in which 2,400 members of the public occupied the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|usually vacant fourth plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], London, for an hour each for 100 days. The project began at 9&amp;nbsp;am on Monday 6 July 2009, and ran until 14 October. The first person to officially occupy the plinth was Rachel Wardell from Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/jul/06/fourth-plinth-protest |title=Fourth plinth gatecrashed, but Gormley is unfazed &amp;#124; Charlotte Higgins &amp;#124; Culture &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary art book by Gormley, entitled ''One and Other'', was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 14 October 2010. The [[Wellcome Trust]] has posted online at its website its series of oral-history interviews of the 2400 plinthers.

==Opening==
The project was opened by the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]]. Minutes before the official launch Stuart Holmes, an anti-smoking protester, managed to clamber onto the plinth and displayed a banner calling for a ban on tobacco.&lt;ref name="Ramnarayan"&gt;Abhinav Ramnarayan [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/06/fourth-plinth-antony-gormley-trafalgar-square "Fourth plinth protester upsets Antony Gormley project"], theguardian.com, 6 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Gormley urged him to do the "gentlemanly thing"&lt;ref name="Ramnarayan"/&gt; and give up his place to the first official "plinther", Rachel Wardell. He did so and descended in the [[cherry picker]] used to carry participants to and from the plinth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6648359.ece Protester hijacks housewife's big moment on Trafalgar Square plinth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8135718.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Arts &amp; Culture &amp;#124; Man scales plinth ahead of launch |publisher=BBC News |date= 6 July 2009|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Members of the public could apply for an hour on the plinth via the project's website. Gormley himself applied but didn't get a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/14/antony-gormley-plinth-trafalgar-square |title=I've got my hour on the plinth, but what should I do up there? &amp;#124; Art and design &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 14 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-08 | location=London | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the event afterwards, the Guardian's top ten "plinthers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2009/oct/09/fourth-plinth-gormley|title=The fourth plinth: top 10|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-11-03 | location=London | date=9 October 2009 | first=Alex | last=Needham}}&lt;/ref&gt; were:

Asked for his favourite, in 2015, Gormley stated that choosing was unfair but, when pushed, selected an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] woman, who sat in the middle of the plinth, curled up into a ball.&lt;ref name= "AGBH"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Antony Gormley: Being Human |series= Imagine |serieslink= Imagine (TV series) |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06nrc0g |accessdate= 3 November 2015 |network= BBC |date= Autumn 2015 |season=  |seriesno=  |number=  |transcript=  |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he had liked a woman from the first day of the event, who was accompanied by a Cuban [[mariachi]] band that performed beneath the plinth, and people who used the opportunity to commemorate war dead.&lt;ref name= "AGBH" /&gt;

Streamed live online by SkyArts, the exhibit quickly developed a cadre of regular Twitter followers who provided a running commentary of events on the plinth.

'''''Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics''''' is a ''[[roman à clef]]'', a work of fiction that actually describes real life characters and events – namely, [[Bill Clinton]]'s first [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|presidential campaign]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992]]. It has been compared to two other novels about American politics: [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946)&lt;ref name="author author"/&gt; and ''[[O: A Presidential Novel]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="who wrote"/&gt;

The book was originally published by an anonymous author, who was later found to be columnist [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]]. Klein completed a sequel of sorts, ''The Running Mate'' in 2000, focusing on the ''Primary Colors'' character of Charlie Martin.&lt;ref name="crossfire"/&gt;

==Unmasking of "Anonymous"==
An early reviewer opined that the author wished to remain unknown because "Anonymity makes truthfulness much easier".&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Later commentators called the publishing of the book under an anonymous identity an effective marketing strategy that produced more publicity for the book, and thus more sales, without calling into question the author's actual inside knowledge.&lt;ref name="who wrote"/&gt;

Several people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet, believed the style of writing had similarities to that of Klein. This was also supported by a quantitative [[stylometry|stylometric]] analysis of the book by [[Vassar College|Vassar]] professor [[Donald Foster (professor)|Donald Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2000/11/02/foster_5/ ''Author Unknown'' by Gavin McNett Salon November 2, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Klein initially denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster.&lt;ref name="enlightens readers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="great unknown"/&gt; Klein denied authorship again in ''[[Newsweek]]'', speculating that another writer wrote it. ''[[Washington Post]]'' Style editor David von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed.&lt;ref name="media's true"/&gt;

On July 17, 1996, after ''The Washington Post'' published the results of a handwriting analysis of notes made on an early manuscript of the book, Klein finally admitted that he was "Anonymous".&lt;ref name="mea culpa"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book begins as an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton, joins the presidential campaign of Southern governor Jack Stanton, a thinly disguised stand-in for [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; The plot then follows the primary election calendar beginning in New Hampshire where Stanton's affair with Cashmere, his wife's hairdresser, and his participation in a Vietnam War era protest come to light and threaten to derail his presidential prospects.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; In Florida, Stanton revives his campaign by disingenuously portraying his Democratic opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel and as a weak supporter of Social Security.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Burton becomes increasingly disillusioned with Stanton, who is a policy wonk who talks too long, eats too much and is overly flirtatious toward women.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Stanton is also revealed to be insincere in his beliefs, saying whatever will help him to win.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Matters finally come to a head, and Burton is forced to choose between idealism and realism.

==Reviews==
''The New York Daily News'' described the book as a farce and praised it as funny, truthful, and as containing "uncannily accurate" portraits of its thinly disguised characters.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt;

'''René Wellek''' (August 22, 1903 – November 11, 1995) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-[[United States|American]] [[comparative literature|comparative]] [[literary critic]]. Like [[Erich Auerbach]], Wellek was an eminent product of the Central European [[philology|philological]] tradition and was known as a vastly erudite and "fair-minded critic of critics."&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt;

René Wellek was born and raised in [[Vienna]], speaking [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[German language|German]]. He studied literature at the [[Charles University]] in Prague, and was active among the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] linguists there, before moving to teach at [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]) in 1935. His younger brother [[Albert Wellek]] (1904-1972) was one of the founders of musical psychology and lived in Germany. Before 1939, Wellek published some 60 items, all written in Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, René. ''Concepts of Criticism'' ed. S. G. Nichols, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1963, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939, the beginning of [[World War II]] in Europe, Wellek lived in America.&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt; He taught first at the [[University of Iowa]] for seven years until 1946, and then, beginning in that year, at [[Yale University]], where he established and chaired a department of comparative literature. In the United States, he was "widely regarded as a founder of the study of [[comparative literature]]."&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt;  With [[Austin Warren]], Wellek published a landmark volume entitled ''[[Theory of Literature]]'', one of the first works to systematize [[literary theory]].

Beginning in the 1960s, Wellek defended the [[New Critics]] against the condemnation of their work in the name of a [[Semiotic literary criticism|structuralist]]-influenced literary theory, and is thus sometimes classed as a conservative critic. Wellek advocated a synthesized approach to literary criticism, one that included 1) literary theory, 2) a careful study of previous works of criticism, and 3) a thorough understanding of the surrounding history involved in an author's creation of a work, including the author's personal history and milieu. Any approach elevating one of these aspects above the other would be in error.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, René. ''Concepts of Criticism'' ed. S. G. Nichols, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1963, p. 2 and p. 20. Reprint of "Literary Theory, Criticism, and History," ''English Studies Today,'' 2nd ser., ed. G. A. Bonnard (Bern, Francke Verlag, 1961) pp. 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellek said the best literary critic must "do what every scientist and scholar does: to isolate his object, in our case, the literary work of art, to contemplate it intently, to analyze, to interpret, and finally to evaluate it by criteria derived from, verified by, buttressed by, as wide a knowledge, as close an observation, as keen a sensibility, as honest a judgment as we can command."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wellek, bringing all of literary theory, criticism, and history into consideration allows a critic to achieve "victory over impermanence, relativity, and history."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowning work of Wellek's career was an eight-volume ''magnum opus'' entitled ''A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950'', the last two volumes of which he dictated from his bed in a nursing home at age 90.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/16/arts/rene-wellek-92-a-professor-of-comparative-literature-dies.html Wellek obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''retrospective''' (from [[Latin]] ''retrospectare'', "look back"), generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past. As a noun, ''retrospective'' has specific meanings in medicine, software development, popular culture and the arts. It is applied as an adjective, synonymous with the term ''[[wikt:retroactive|retroactive]]'', to laws, standards, and awards.

==Medicine==
A [[Medicine|medical]] retrospective is an examination of a patient's [[medical history]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].

==Arts and popular culture==
A retrospective exhibition presents works from an extended period of an artist's activity. Similarly, a retrospective [[compilation album]] is assembled from a recording artist's past material, usually their [[greatest hits]]. A television or newsstand special about an actor, politician, or other celebrity will present a retrospective of the subject's career highlights. A leading (usually elderly) academic may be honored with a [[Festschrift]], an honorary book of articles or a lecture series relating topically to a retrospective of the honoree's career. Celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]] good-naturedly mock the career of the guest of honor, often in a retrospective format.

==Awards==
A retrospective or retroactive award is one which is created and then awarded to persons who would have received it before. Alternatively, a slight change to the criteria of an existing award may result in retrospective awards being presented to persons who would have won the award under present rules. Comparatively few awards are presented retrospectively.

==Law==
The term is used in situations where the law (statutory, civil, or regulatory) is changed or reinterpreted, affecting acts committed before the alteration. When such changes make a previously committed lawful act now unlawful in a retroactive manner, this is known as an [[Ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' law]] or [[retroactive law]]. Because such laws punish the accused for acts that were not unlawful when committed, they are rare, and not permissible in most legal systems. More commonly, changes retroactively worsen the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; by changing the punishment or recompense prescribed, as by adding new penalties, extending sentences, or increasing fines and damages payable; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make exoneration more difficult than it would have been.

Conversely, a form of retrospective law commonly called an [[amnesty law]] may decriminalize certain acts. A [[pardon]] has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. An ''[[in mitius]]'' change may alleviate possible consequences for unlawful acts (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Finally, when a previous law is [[repeal]]ed or otherwise nullified, it is no longer applicable to situations to which it had been, even if such situations arose before the law was voided; this principle is known as ''[[nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]''.

==Software development==
{{refsection|date=April 2017}}
The term is also used in [[software engineering]], where a retrospective is a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project or process (often after an [[Iterative and incremental development|iteration]]) to discuss what was successful about the project or time period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the successes and improvements in future iterations or projects. Retrospective can be done in many different ways.

In [[Agile software development|agile development]], retrospectives play a very important role in iterative and incremental development. At the end of every iteration a retrospective is held to look for ways to improve the process for the next iteration. [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] call this the Sprint Retrospective.

==Standards==
In the context of scientific and technical standards, retrospectivity applies current norms to material that pre-dates new rules. An example of a retrospective or retroactive standard is the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN Code), a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] which governs the formal [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific naming]] of [[animal]]s, of which the 4th edition is effective since 2000. All previous editions of the ICZN Code, or previous other rules and conventions are disregarded today,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 86.3]&lt;/ref&gt; and the scientific names published in former times are to be evaluated only under the present edition of the ICZN Code.

[[Image:William Hogarth 017.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Scene from Shakespeare's The Tempest'' by Hogarth; Circa 1735]]

'''''Scene from Shakespeare's The Tempest''''', also known as '''''Ferdinand courting Miranda''''' ({{circa|1736–1738}}) is an oil painting by the English painter [[William Hogarth]].{{sfn|Paulson|1992|p=200}} It has been displayed at [[Nostell Priory]] since 1766, and was acquired by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 2002.  The National Trust claims that it is "the first known painting of a scene from Shakespeare".{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}}{{sfn|Pask|2013|pp=54–55}}

The painting is a rich and vibrant example of Hogarth's work, painted c.1730-5 as a special project for one of his devoted band of patrons—[[George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield|The Earl of Macclesfield]]—as part of Hogarth's attempt to found an distinctively British school of history painting. It is thought that Hogarth was hoping that more commissions for similar scenes would come flowing in after painting this scene, but this did not happen.{{sfn|Art Fund|2002}}{{sfn|Tate Britain|n.d.}}

It measures {{convert|80|x|106.5|cm}} and depicts a scene from Act 1 scene ii of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[The Tempest]]'', with [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] courting [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]]. Miranda is depicted sitting on a throne made of shells and coral, distracted and thus spilling from a bowl of milk that she has been feeding to a lamb.  To the left is her father [[Prospero]], and further left is Ferdinand.  The spirit [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] floats above, playing a [[lute]] or [[mandolin]].  To the right is the misshapen monster [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]], with a bat above his head, grimacing and drooling as he stamps on a dove.{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}}

The painting was bought from the Earl of Macclesfield's widow in 1766 by [[Sir Rowland Winn, 5th Baronet]],{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}} and was hung on the walls of [[Nostell Priory]], near [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] for over two centuries by the [[Winn Baronets]] and then their relatives the [[Baron St Oswald|Barons St Oswald]]. Nostell Priory was acquired by the National Trust in 1953, but the former owners retained most of the contents. When the 6th [[Baron St Oswald]] announced his wish to sell the painting in 2002, it was bought by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], with the whole cost of nearly £300,000 funded with a grant from the [[Art Fund]].{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2002}}

'''''Short Cuts''''' is a 1993 American [[comedy-drama]] film, directed by [[Robert Altman]]. Filmed from a screenplay by Altman and Frank Barhydt, it is inspired by nine [[Short story|short stories]] and a poem by [[Raymond Carver]]. The film has a [[Los Angeles]] setting, which substitues the [[Pacific Northwest]] backdrop of Carver's stories. Short Cuts traces the actions of 22 principal characters, both in parallel and at occasional loose points of connection. The role of chance and luck is central to the film, and many of the stories concern death and infidelity.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Matthew Modine]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Lori Singer]], [[Andie MacDowell]], [[Buck Henry]], [[Lily Tomlin]], actress and singer [[Annie Ross]], and musicians [[Huey Lewis]], [[Lyle Lovett]] and [[Tom Waits]].

==Plot==
A fleet of helicopters sprays for [[medfly|medflies]] and reveals all the characters along the path of their flight. Dr. Ralph Wyman ([[Matthew Modine]]) and his wife, Marian ([[Julianne Moore]]), meet another couple, Stuart ([[Fred Ward]]) and Claire Kane ([[Anne Archer]]) - an out-of-work salesman and a party clown respectively - at Zoe Trainer's ([[Lori Singer]]) cello concert and make a spontaneous Sunday dinner date. Marian's sister, Sherri ([[Madeleine Stowe]]), is married to philandering cop Gene ([[Tim Robbins]]), who invents unbelievable stories to hide his affair with Betty Weathers ([[Frances McDormand]]). Betty is in the process of divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy ([[Peter Gallagher]]). Waitress Doreen Piggot ([[Lily Tomlin]]) is married to an alcoholic limo driver, Earl ([[Tom Waits]]). Television commentator Howard Finnigan ([[Bruce Davison]]) lives with his wife, Anne ([[Andie MacDowell]]), and their young son, Casey (Zane Cassidy), next door to Zoe and her mother, cabaret singer Tess ([[Annie Ross]]). Their pool cleaner is Jerry Kaiser ([[Chris Penn]]), whose wife, Lois ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), works from home as a phone sex operator by tending to the children while she talks off strange men. Jerry and Lois are friends with Doreen's daughter, Honey ([[Lili Taylor]]), and her husband, Bill ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), who works as a makeup artist.

The day before the eighth birthday of Casey, Doreen hits him with her car as he is running to school. Casey appears fine and refuses Doreen's offer of a ride home, as she is a stranger. His mother comes home from ordering his birthday cake to find him slumped lethargically on the couch. Howard convinces her to take Casey to the hospital, where he remains unconscious. The baker, Andy Bitkower ([[Lyle Lovett]]), calls the next day to inform Ann that the cake is ready, but Howard, wanting to keep the line free, briskly ends the conversation. The baker immediately calls back, incensed at being hung up on. While the Finnigans maintain their vigil, Bitkower continues to call and harass the couple. Howard's estranged father Paul ([[Jack Lemmon]]) turns up at the hospital and recalls that Casey's hospitalization reminds him of the day that Howard was in a car accident as a boy. When Howard's mother went to her sister's house, she found her in bed with her husband, whom she had seduced. That led to the estrangement between father and son.

Stuart and his two friends, Gordon ([[Buck Henry]]) and Vern ([[Huey Lewis]]), harass Doreen at the diner before they head out on their three-day fishing trip. On the first day, they find a young woman's body, submerged near some rocks. After some debate, they decide to tie her to the rocks, continue fishing, and report the body when they are done. When he comes home, Stuart eventually admits to Claire what they had done, and she is disgusted that they could fish for days with the woman's body nearby. The body is identified as a 23-year-old woman, and Claire visits the funeral home out of a sense of guilt.

Stormy visits Betty's house while she is away with their son Chad (Jarrett Lennon), ostensibly to pick up his mother's clock, but instead spends the day destroying her belongings. Bill and Honey entertain themselves in the apartment that they are watching while its owners are on vacation by taking some pictures of Honey in which Bill has made her up to look as if she has been brutally beaten. Gene abandons the family dog on a strange street because he cannot endure its barking, but after several days of his distraught children's inquiries, he returns to the neighbourhood and retrieves the dog, who has been picked up by Vern's family. The Wymans get into a massive argument just before their dinner party with the Kanes. Marian admits to an affair. Both couples alleviate their stress by drinking heavily, and the party lasts all night long.

One day, Casey's eyes begin to flutter. Ann's excitement grows, but just as he appears to be fully waking, he suddenly dies. Seeing that and being overwhelmed, Howard's father, Paul, leaves the hospital while the distraught couple returns home and informs Zoe of Casey's death. The next day, they go to the bakery to shame Bitkower over his abuse of them. When he learns why they never picked up the cake, he asks them to stay and gives them baked goods. Zoe, worn to the breaking point by her mother's alcoholism and her isolation, commits suicide by starting a car engine inside her garage; she plays the cello as she asphyxiates. Later that day, her mother discovers Zoe's death and is bewildered.

When Honey picks up the pictures from the developer, they are mixed up with Gordon's. He is horrified to see the pictures of Honey, who is apparently beaten so badly, and she is horrified by the pictures Gordon took of the submerged body on his fishing trip. They walk away from each other, memorizing each other's license plates. Honey and Bill are on their way to a picnic with Jerry and Lois. In the park, Jerry and Bill try to rape two young women they encountered earlier, and Bill quickly makes an excuse to divvy up into couples. As he and one of the girls walk away from Jerry and the other girl, they hear her scream. They turn around to see Jerry hitting her in the head with a rock, just as a major earthquake strikes. In the aftermath, Jerry's murder of the girl is attributed to a falling rock during the earthquake.

'''''Spiral Jetty''''' is an [[land art|earthwork]] sculpture constructed in April 1970 that is considered to be the most important work of American sculptor [[Robert Smithson]]. Smithson documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled ''Spiral Jetty''.

Built on the northeastern shore of the [[Great Salt Lake]] near Rozel Point in [[Utah]] entirely of mud, salt crystals, and [[basalt]] rocks, ''Spiral Jetty'' forms a {{convert|1500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake.

In 1999, the artwork was donated to [[Dia Art Foundation]]. Since its initial construction, those interested in its fate have dealt with questions of proposed changes in land use in the area surrounding the sculpture.

==Description==
The sculpture is built of mud, precipitated salt crystals, and [[basalt]] rocks. The sculpture forms a {{convert|1500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/spiral_jetty.htm|title=Spiral Jetty|work=robertsmithson.com|publisher=James Cohan Gallery|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is sometimes visible and sometimes submerged, depending upon the water level of the Great Salt Lake.

==Construction==
[[Image:Spiraljetty.jpg|thumb|right|Person standing in the middle of ''Spiral Jetty'', viewed from the shore]]
Smithson reportedly chose the Rozel Point site based on the blood-red color of the water and its connection with the [[primordial sea]]. The red hue of the water is due to the presence of salt-tolerant [[bacteria]] and [[algae]] that thrive in the extreme 27 percent [[salinity]] of the lake's north arm, which was isolated from freshwater sources by the building of [[Great Salt Lake#Causeway|a causeway]] by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] in 1959.

Smithson was reportedly attracted to the Rozel Point site because of the stark anti-pastoral beauty and industrial remnants from nearby [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]], as well as an old pier and a few unused oil rigs.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|work=nytimes.com|title=Out of the Deep|date=13 October 2002|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-10-13-02-phenomenon-out-of-the-deep.html|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While observing the construction of the piece from a helicopter, Smithson reportedly remarked "et in [[Utah]] ego" as a counterpoint to the pastoral [[Baroque]] painting ''[[et in Arcadia ego]]'' by [[Nicolas Poussin]].&lt;ref name=writings&gt;{{cite book|last=Smithson|first=Robert|editor-last=Holt|editor-first=Nancy|title=The Writings of Robert Smithson: Essays with Illustrations|location=New York NY|publisher=New York University Press|year=1979|isbn=9780814733943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To move the rock into the lake, Smithson hired Bob Phillips of nearby [[Ogden, Utah]], who used two dump trucks, a large tractor, and a [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] to haul the 6,650 tons of rock and earth into the lake. It is reported that Smithson had a difficult time convincing a contractor to accept the unusual proposal. Spiral Jetty was the first of his pieces to require the acquisition of land rights and earthmoving equipment.&lt;ref name=AAA-finding-aid&gt;{{cite web|title=A Finding Aid to the Robert Smithson and Nancy Holt papers|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/robert-smithson-and-nancy-holt-papers-7105/more|publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began work on the jetty in April 1970. The work was actually constructed twice; the first time requiring six days. After contemplating the result for two days, Smithson called the crew back and had the shape altered to its present configuration, an effort requiring moving 7,000 tons of basalt rock during an additional three days.&lt;ref name=trib/&gt;

==Construction contractor==
Robert "Bob" Phillips (5 August 1939 – 11 April 2016) worked for 40 years in construction, including positions as a bid estimator for Utah contracting companies Jack B. Parsons Construction, and Whitaker Construction. He often told people that his best-known construction job was “the only thing I ever built that ... was to look at and had no purpose.”

Phillips was an expert at construction materials and techniques and was proficient in projecting the cost and effort required for a projected job.

Phillips was uneasy about using earth-moving equipment in the muck around Rozel Point, where Smithson wanted to create the jetty. “It’s tricky working out on that lake,” Phillips said. “There’s lots of backhoes buried out there.” Smithson, in hip-wader boots, was in full command on the site. “When we got out there, he just took over,” Phillips said. “I don’t think he had done any geology work or anything on it. He just had in his mind what it should look like.… He just had the eye for it. I assume it was the artist in him.”

Smithson actually had Phillips’ crew build the jetty twice. The first took six days of work, using heavy equipment, but two days later, Smithson had Phillips’ team redo it, to create today's spiral shape.

Phillips said Smithson liked to use words like “entropy” to describe the interaction of the basalt and the lake.

Robert Phillips was born in [[Spanish Fork, Utah]] and grew up in [[Cache Valley]].  He married Judy Crocket in January 1961. They had four children. He earned a degree in entomology from [[Utah State University]]. He died of cancer in Ogden.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;Sean P. Means, [http://saltlaketribune.ut.newsmemory.com/ ''Contractor brought Spiral Jetty to life''], [[Salt Lake Tribune]], 19 April 2016, p. A11 {{registration|yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The sculpture was financed in part by a $9,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] grant from the [[Virginia Dwan]] Gallery of [[New York City|New York]].

In 1999, through the generosity of the artist Nancy Holt, Smithson’s wife, and the Estate of Robert Smithson, ''Spiral Jetty'' was donated to Dia Art Foundation. As owner and custodian of ''Spiral Jetty'', Dia Art Foundation maintains the lease of Utah sovereign lands in Great Salt Lake upon which the artwork is sited, and is responsible for the stewardship of this iconic earthwork.

Smithson died in a helicopter crash in [[Texas]] three years after finishing the jetty.&lt;ref name="pagel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/gosp/tour/pagel.html|title=The Immobile Cyclone: Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty|last=Pagel|first=Angelika|publisher=National Park Service|work=nps.gov|accessdate=6 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725201046/http://www.nps.gov/gosp/tour/pagel.html|archivedate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
At the time Dia acquired ''Spiral Jetty'', the work was fully submerged in the lake. Beginning in the early 2000s, however, sustained drought in Utah caused water levels to recede, and ''Spiral Jetty'' became visible for the first prolonged period in its history. As a result, the prominence of ''Spiral Jetty'' has risen dramatically over the past decade, increasing both the visitorship to the site and the public’s interest in the artwork, at the local, national, and international levels.

Dia is committed to maintaining a photographic record of the work and documenting changes to the piece over time. Dia collaborates with two organizations in Utah, the Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College (GSLI) and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (UMFA) at the University of Utah, who have been deeply involved in the advocacy of ''Spiral Jetty'' over the years.

The issue of preservation has been complicated by ambiguous statements by Smithson, who expressed an admiration for [[entropy]] in that he intended his works to mimic earthly attributes in that they remain in a state of arrested disruption and not be kept from destruction.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

In 2008 plans were announced for exploratory oil drilling approximately five miles from the jetty.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. The New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/arts/06arts-ARTISTSRALLY_BRF.html "Artists Rally for Spiral Jetty in Utah"] Feb 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with strong resistance from artists, and the state of Utah received more than 3,000 e-mails about the plan, most opposing the drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kirk. The New York Times, 27 March 2008. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/us/27spiral.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin "Plans to Mix Oil Drilling and Art Clash in Utah"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- if this NYTimes link ever dies, use http://www.backupurl.com/mniq5w --&gt;

Paul Getty Trust|date=|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/videos/focus/spiral_jetty_sunrise.html|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1970 during the construction of the jetty, Robert Smithson wrote and directed a 32-minute color film, ''Spiral Jetty''.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/films/txt/spiral.html|title=Spiral Jetty, 1970 Film by Robert Smithson|work=robertsmithson.com|publisher=James Cohan Gallery|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot by Smithson and his wife [[Nancy Holt]], and funded by Virginia Dwan and Douglas Christmas.

The film documented the construction process and also formed an ancillary artwork.  Smithson combines his interest in geology, paleontology, astronomy, mythology and cinema, stating that he had an interest in documenting "the earth's history".&lt;ref name="Jetty109"/&gt; In conjunction with filmed sequences of the jetty, Smithson incorporates footage of dinosaurs in a natural history museum and the ripped pages from a history text. During this scene, Smithson refers to the institutions of history: "the earth's history seems at times like a story recorded in a book, each page of which is torn into small pieces. Many of the pages and some of the pieces of each page are missing".&lt;ref name=film/&gt; Smithson's narrative supports an alternative view of historical discourse and the art object's placement or production outside of the museum institution. His writings also indicate that the helicopter film sequences over the jetty were a method of "recapitulating the scale of the jetty".&lt;ref name="Jetty109"/&gt; By visually disorienting the viewer, Smithson is able to negate a time and place for the materiality of the artwork or create what he calls a "cosmic rupture".&lt;ref name="Jetty109"&gt;Smithson, Robert. ''The Spiral Jetty'', 1970, published in Robert Smithson: The Collected Writings, edited by Nancy Holt, New York University Press, pp. 109-113&lt;/ref&gt; Through this state, the viewer is meant to be unable to categorize or classify the site, and will be left in a state free from the dialect of history.

== Legacy ==

The work was named Utah's official state work of art in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty Is Named Utah's Official State Artwork |work=[[Artforum]] |date=2017-03-13 |url=https://www.artforum.com/news/id=67068 |accessdate=2017-03-15 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Terry Isaac grew up in the [[Willamette Valley]] of Oregon, and it is there that he began working with [[wildlife]]. Drawing inspiration from his own backyard and from the captivating vistas of the Northwest, he began to create dramatic [[wildlife art]]. He now calls [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia]], Canada [[home]].&lt;ref name="website_home"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://terryisaacsart.com
|title=The Art of Terry Isaac
|work=terryisaacsart.com
|publisher=Ghost Bear Enterprises
|accessdate=August 19, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since moving, he has continued to create [[paintings]] capturing unique characteristics of wildlife and their [[habitats]]. Terry travels around the world to capture images, but his main painting focus continues to be on North American [[birds]] and [[mammals]].&lt;ref name="Isaac"&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaac|first=Terry|title=Artist's Biography|url=http://www.terryisaacsart.com/about-terry/artists-biography/|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac paints predominantly in [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]] and particularly admires the art of the nineteenth century painters [[Thomas Moran]] and [[Albert Bierstadt]], who painted the dramatic light and [[landscapes]] of the west.&lt;ref name="artandnature.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaac|first=Terry|title=Terry Isaac's Visual Art|url=http://www.artandnature.com/isaac.html|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry’s formal art began with an interest in [[animation]] and drawing [[cartoons]], with an intent on working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]].&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt;  After art college, he was interested in [[Children's literature|children’s book]] illustration but soon re-discovered his childhood passion for wildlife. Since the mid 1980s, he has created realistic wildlife art with a focus on particularity and dramatic light. He incorporates large [[panoramas]] as well as [[close-up]] views, with subjects ranging from [[whales]] to [[hummingbirds]].&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt;

During his professional career as an [[artist]] Terry Isaac has been placed in 12 stamp and [[Printmaking|print]] competitions, been commissioned to create for the ''Audubon Society'' handbooks and hired to develop the main character, ''Aladar'', in a Walt Disney production.&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt; His works are housed in prominent permanent collections such as Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum, Bennington Center For The Arts, [[American Airlines]], [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank of South Africa]] and in many private and corporate collections around the world. His paintings have appeared for sale and re-sale at [[Christie's|Christies Auction House]], [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaac|first=Terry|title=Art and Nature|url=http://www.artandnature.com/isaac.html|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac continues to participate in several important art competitions, including the [[Society of Animal Artists]] annual exhibition and [[Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum|Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum’s]] prestigious ''Birds in Art'' exhibition, in which his art will have been featured 14 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Country Canada|url=http://www.artcountrycanada.com/isaacbio.htm|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides painting, Isaac is a casual singer-songwriter of [[folk rock]] and [[soft rock]] music. It is his dream to have a song written by him on the radio.&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt;

Isaac is also a [[teacher]] and his approach to painting is outlined in his own book ''Painting the Drama of Wildlife, Step by Step'' now in its second edition. The book’s success led to the creation of a DVD, ''Painting Wildlife in Acrylic'' as well as featured in several other books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaac|first=Terry|title=Store|url=http://www.terryisaacsart.com/store/instructional-dvds/|publisher=Ghost Bear Enterprises|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Terry continues to teach annual workshops, with students attending from all over the world.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt;

Demand for Terry’s [[originality|originals]] has remained high, partly due to the fact that his technique of painting and the detail which he captures means that he paints relatively few paintings per year. Terry’s work was published by ''Mill Pond Press'' for almost 20 years, and many of his [[Special edition|limited edition]] prints are sold out. Terry is now a [[Self-publishing|self-published artist]], who strives to create works of art for [[collecting|collectors]] and only prints a select number of his paintings with very small edition sizes.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt;

Terry Isaac holds his own [[Art museum|gallery]] and framing shop among the vineyards and orchards on the South Okanagan’s "[[Naramata Bench]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaac|first=Terry|title=Location|url=http://www.terryisaacsart.com/gallery-location/|publisher=Ghost Bear Enterprises|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he gives workshops on painting techniques throughout the year. Although Isaac received a formal art education, graduating with honours, he believes his best training has come from being outdoors and from studying the work of his favourite wildlife artists.&lt;ref name="artandnature.com"/&gt;

'''''The Express''''' (also known as '''''The Express: The Ernie Davis Story''''') is a 2008 American [[List of sports films|sports film]] produced by [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] and directed by [[Gary Fleder]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Charles Leavitt]] from a book titled ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by Robert C. Gallagher. The film is based on the life of [[Syracuse University]] [[Syracuse Orange football|football]] player [[Ernie Davis]], the first [[African American]] to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], portrayed by actor [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]. ''The Express'' explores civil rights topics, such as racism, discrimination and athletics.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;[[Gary Fleder]]. (2008). ''The Express'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was a co-production between the film studios of [[Relativity Media]] and [[Davis Entertainment]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] for home media. [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Charles S. Dutton]] star in principal supporting roles. The original motion picture soundtrack with a musical score composed by [[Mark Isham]], was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008.

''The Express'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 10, 2008. Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, the film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $9.8 million against its $40 million budget. The [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] version of the film, featuring deleted scenes and the director's commentary was released on January 20, 2009.

==Plot==
[[Ernie Davis]] ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) is a young African American growing up in Pennsylvania with his same-age uncle Will Davis Jr. ([[Nelsan Ellis]]), in the late 1940s during a time of racism and discrimination. Davis lives with his extended family, including his grandfather, Willie 'Pops' Davis ([[Charles S. Dutton]]), who guides and educates him. Davis' mother, Marie Davis ([[Aunjanue Ellis]]), eventually returns to their residence to inform the family that she has remarried and can now afford to raise Ernie at her own home in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Upon relocating to Elmira, Davis enrolls in a Small Fry Football League and excels on the field as a running back.

Several years later, Syracuse University football head coach [[Ben Schwartzwalder]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]) searches for a running back to address the absence of [[Jim Brown]] ([[Darrin Dewitt Henson]]), the graduating player completing his All-American senior season. Schwartzwalder is impressed with Davis after viewing footage of him playing for Elmira Free Academy. Schwartzwalder convinces Brown to accompany him on a recruiting visit to see Davis and his family in hopes of luring him to sign with Syracuse. After their visit, Davis decides to enroll at Syracuse and spurns the recruiting efforts of other colleges.

At the start of the 1959 college football season, Davis immediately excels playing for the varsity team, to lead Syracuse to victories over several college football teams. After Syracuse defeats UCLA to conclude the regular season undefeated, the team decides by choice to play the 2nd ranked Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic. During the game on January 1, 1960, Davis boldly attempts to lead his team to victory but is hampered by an injured leg and biased officiating. Towards the end of the game, Davis scores a crucial touchdown to preserve a Syracuse lead. The matchup concludes with a victory for Syracuse, and its first national championship.

In 1961, Davis goes on to win the Heisman Trophy following his senior season in college. He later becomes a professional athlete in the National Football League and signs a contract with the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Later however, following a series of health concerns, Davis is taken to a hospital to undergo medical testing. During a routine practice session, team owner [[Art Modell]] ([[Saul Rubinek]]) informs Davis he will be unable to play the upcoming season due to his condition. Subsequently, Davis holds a press conference and announces he has been diagnosed with leukemia. The Cleveland Browns honor Ernie by allowing him to suit up in uniform and join the team while running out before a televised game.

The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that Davis died on May 18, 1963 at the age of 23; while in condolence, President Kennedy expresses sympathy for Davis' fine character as a citizen and an athlete.

==Production==

===Development===
The premise of ''The Express'' is based on the true story of [[Ernie Davis]], the charismatic athlete who became the first African American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], college football's greatest achievement. Excelling in high school football, Davis was later recruited by dozens of predominantly white universities. A local sports columnist dubbed him the ''Elmira Express''.&lt;ref name=nfl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80b75df1/article/ernie-davis-legacy-lives-on-long-after-his-death |title=Ernie Davis' legacy lives on long after his death |publisher=National Football League |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was told of his terminal illness, leukemia, during the summer of 1962.&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt; According to a saddened Art Modell, he said "They told him as gently as they could that it was an incurable case of leukemia. It was awful, but the way he took it, it seemed like much more of a blow to me and his teammates than it was to him."&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt;

Following the NFL draft which saw the [[Washington Redskins]] trade their pick of Davis to Cleveland for Hall of Fame running back Bobby Mitchell, Davis signed a $100,000 contract with the Browns.&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt; On May 16, 1963, Davis visited [[Cleveland Browns]] owner Art Modell. He promised to make a career comeback even though he looked terminally ill.&lt;ref name=hnn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/55556.html |title=Why Ernie Davis Matters |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later on May 18, Davis died from the then-incurable disease. Fellow teammate and close friend [[John Brown (offensive tackle)|John Brown]], remembered him as a "genuine gentle man as well as a gentleman."&lt;ref name=hnn /&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] called Davis "an outstanding young man of great character" and "an inspiration to the young people of this country."&lt;ref name=hnn /&gt; The book titled ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by writer Robert C. Gallagher, became the basis for the film.

===Set design and filming===
Filming began in April 2007 at [[Chicago]] area locations including [[Lane Technical High School]], [[Amundsen High School]], [[J. Sterling Morton High School District 201|J.

Existing buildings that were not on the Syracuse University campus had to be digitally removed from shots, such as the [[Carrier Dome]].

===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''The Express'' was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008. It features songs composed with considerable use of the [[violin]], [[trombone]] and [[violoncello|cello]]. The score for the film was orchestrated by [[Mark Isham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.barnesandnoble.com/Express/e/780163403022/?itm=27&amp;USRI=ernie+davis ''Express Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''].

==Historical inaccuracies==
Journalists and film critics noted that a scene of "racist vitriol"&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John (September 28, 2008). [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938515.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 ''The Express'']. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Retrieved 2010-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; involving the October 24, 1959 game between [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]] was fictitious and, as ''[[Film Journal International]]'' critic [[Frank Lovece]] noted, "veers remarkably toward outright slander."&lt;ref name=fji&gt;Lovece, Frank (October 2008). [http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003871198 ''The Express'']. ''[[Film Journal International]]''. Retrieved 2010-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; He further points out that the game was "falsely shown as taking place at WVU's [[Mountaineer Field (1924)|Mountaineer Field]]" in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], "rather than at Syracuse's own Archbold Stadium," the Orangemen's home field at that time in New York state. Syracuse quarterback Dick Easterly, who played with Davis, said shortly after the movie's release, "I don't blame people in West Virginia for being disturbed. The scene is completely fictitious."&lt;ref name=cdm&gt;Thompson, Matthew (October 8, 2008). [http://www.dailymail.com/Sports/WVUSports/200810080283 New movie shows WVU fans in false, ugly light] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081011042023/http://www.dailymail.com/Sports/WVUSports/200810080283 |date=October 11, 2008 }}.

The film suggests that Syracuse University had to win the 1960 Cotton Bowl to be named college football's national champion, when in fact the selection was made at the end of the regular season.  This practice did not change until the late-60's.

[[Bobby Lackey]], quarterback for the [[Texas Longhorns football (1950–59)#1959|1959 Texas Longhorns]], stated in 2008 that the racial tensions and Longhorn behavior depicted in the New Year's Day [[1960 Cotton Bowl Classic]] were made-up "stories to try and sell more movie tickets," and justifies the action of his roommate, Larry Stephens, as just "trying to get the guy (Davis) into a fight so he could get him thrown out of the game because their athletes were so much better than ours."&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Cedric (October 10, 2008).

Other inaccuracies are more along the line of the discrepancies in any fictionalized depiction of historical events. For example, the film places the 1959 Penn State game in the first three of Syracuse's season, with Syracuse winning 32-6, when it was actually the seventh game and Syracuse had their toughest challenge of the season, winning [[1959 Syracuse Orangemen football team#Schedule|a close 20-18 game]] to advance to a 7-0 record. The [[1960 Cotton Bowl Classic#Game summary|order of scoring]] in the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic was adjusted in the film for dramatic tension.

[[Art Modell]] is shown giving [[Jim Brown]] his first [[Cleveland Browns]] [[Jersey (clothing)#In sports|jersey]] in a photo op, but Modell did not purchase the Browns until four years after Brown joined the team. The scene in which [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]] and Modell arrange a major trade was actually made by Browns coach and general manager [[Paul Brown]] behind Modell's back, adding to the tension between the two.

On [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote: "''The Express'' is involving and inspiring in the way a good movie about sports almost always is. The formula is basic and durable, and when you hitch it to a good story, you can hardly fail. Gary Fleder does more than that in telling the story of Ernie Davis ("The Elmira Express"), the running back for Syracuse who became the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy, in 1961."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;Ebert, Roger (October 8, 2008).

Fleder (expertly assisted by cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau and editors Padraic McKinley and William Steinkamp) ices the cake with some first-rate game footage."&lt;ref name="lane" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "special" while remarking, "There is a lot of football in the movie. It's well presented, but there is the usual oddity that it almost entirely shows mostly success."&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; 

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Peter Hartlaub wrote that the film "deserves plenty of credit for abandoning the ''"Remember the Titans"/"Glory Road"'' school of screenwriting as laid out above and exploring the racial issues in Davis' story in more realistic terms." He thought Quaid gave a "memorable performance" by portraying Schwartzwalder as "sort of an accidental civil rights hero."&lt;ref&gt;Hartlaub, Peter (October 10, 2008).

On its production merits, he commented how the film displayed "Terrific editing by William Steinkamp and Padraic McKinley" which "intermarries the onfield action, flashbacks to Davis' Southern boyhood, a smattering of period footage and a great deal of stylized visualization to a degree that distracts from the very basic sports-movie arc of the story".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John (September 28, 2008).

The film stars [[Shailene Woodley]], [[Ansel Elgort]], [[Laura Dern]], [[Sam Trammell]], [[Nat Wolff]], and [[Willem Dafoe]] playing supporting roles. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient, played by Elgort.

Development of ''The Fault in Our Stars'' began in January 2012 when [[Fox 2000]], a division of [[20th Century Fox]], optioned the rights to adapt the novel into a feature film. Principal photography began on August 26, 2013, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with a few additional days in Amsterdam,  The Netherlands, before concluding on October 16, 2013. Pittsburgh doubled for all of the scenes set in Indianapolis, Indiana, the novel's setting, as well as for some interior scenes set in Amsterdam.

''The Fault in Our Stars'' was released in the United States on June 6, 2014, to positive critical reception, with praise given to Woodley's and Elgort's performances as well as the screenplay. The film was also a blockbuster, becoming number one at the box office during its opening weekend, and grossing over $307 million worldwide against a budget of $12 million. It was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on September 16, 2014, and grossed over $42 million in total domestic video sales.&lt;ref name="The Numbers"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fault in Our Stars (2014)|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fault-in-Our-Stars-The#tab=summary|website=The Numbers.|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC.|accessdate=10 August 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918191530/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fault-in-Our-Stars-The | archivedate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazel Grace Lancaster is a teenager living in Indianapolis,  who has terminal [[thyroid cancer]] that has spread to her lungs. Believing she is depressed, her mother Frannie urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient [[support group]] to help her make friends with individuals who are going through the same thing. There Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a charming teenager who lost a leg to [[osteosarcoma|bone cancer]] but has since apparently been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite books. Hazel recommends ''An Imperial Affliction'', a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel ''Counter Insurgence''. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten ([[Willem Dafoe]]), retreated to [[Amsterdam]] following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.

Weeks later, Augustus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and has corresponded with Van Houten by email. She writes to him to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending. Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie kindly refuses because of financial and medical constraints. Augustus suggests that she use the "cancer wish" she received from [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] but Hazel explains that she has already used hers to visit [[Walt Disney World]]. Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love. Augustus surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam. After a medical setback, Hazel's doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.

Hazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam and are presented with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the [[Anne Frank House]], where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.

After their return to [[Indianapolis]], Augustus' health worsens. He is taken to the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he "gave me a forever within the numbered days." Augustus dies eight days later and Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. He tells her that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that the novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from [[leukemia]] at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper which she crumples up asking him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads his words accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: "Okay."

In Amsterdam, three days of filming took place. Woodley and Elgort were filmed on a canal-side public bench. On July 2, 2014, ''The Guardian'' reported that the bench had gone missing, and city officials said they did not know where it was.

Author John Green, though an Indianapolis native, was pleased with the selection of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that&lt;blockquote&gt; Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though it has a lot of hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Best-of-the-Burgh-Blogs/The-412/October-2013/QA-The-Fault-in-Our-Stars-Author-John-Green/#sthash.CQwZmVIp.dpuf|title=Q+A: 'The Fault in Our Stars' Author John Green|work=pittsburghmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Turn of the Screw''''' is an 1898 [[horror fiction|horror]] novella by [[Henry James]] that first appeared in serial format in ''[[Collier's]] Weekly'' magazine (January 27 – April 16, 1898). In October 1898 it appeared in ''The Two Magics'', a book published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in New York City and [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in London. Classified as both [[gothic fiction]] and a [[ghost story]], the novella focuses on a governess who, caring for two children at a remote estate, becomes convinced that the grounds are haunted.

In the century following its publication, ''The Turn of the Screw'' became a cornerstone text of academics who subscribed to [[New Criticism]]. The novella has had differing interpretations, often mutually exclusive. Many critics have tried to determine the exact nature of the evil hinted at by the story. However, others have argued that the brilliance of the novella results from its ability to create an intimate sense of confusion and suspense within the reader.

The novella has been adapted numerous times in radio drama, film, stage, and television, including a [[The Innocents (play)|1950 Broadway play]], and the 1961 film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]''.

== Plot ==
On Christmas Eve, an unnamed narrator listens to Douglas, a friend, read a manuscript written by a former [[governess]] whom Douglas claims to have known and who is now dead. The manuscript tells the story of how the young governess is hired by a man who has become responsible for his young nephew and niece after the deaths of their parents. He lives mainly in London but also has a country house, Bly. He is uninterested in raising the children.

The boy, Miles, is attending a [[boarding school]], while his younger sister, Flora, is living at a summer country house in [[Essex]]. She is currently being cared for by Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper. Miles and Flora's uncle, the governess' new employer, gives her full charge of the children and explicitly states that she is not to bother him with communications of any sort.  The governess travels to her new employer's country house and begins her duties.

Miles soon returns from school for the summer just after a letter arrives from the headmaster stating that he has been expelled. Miles never speaks of the matter, and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue. She fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion but is too charmed by the adorable young boy to want to press the issue. Soon thereafter, around the grounds of the estate, the governess begins to see the figures of a man and woman whom she does not recognise. These figures come and go at will without ever being seen or challenged by other members of the household, and they seem to the governess to be supernatural. She learns from Mrs. Grose that the governess' predecessor, Miss Jessel, and another employee, Peter Quint, had had a sexual relationship. Before their deaths, Jessel and Quint spent much of their time with Flora and Miles, and this fact has grim significance for the current governess when she becomes convinced that the two children are secretly aware of the ghosts' presence.

Later, without permission, Flora leaves the house while Miles is playing music for the governess. The governess notices Flora's absence and goes with Mrs. Grose in search of her. They find her in a [[folly]] on the shore of the lake, and the governess is convinced that Flora has been talking to the ghost of Miss Jessel. When the governess finally confronts Flora, the girl denies seeing Miss Jessel and demands never to see the governess again. At the governess' suggestion, Mrs. Grose takes Flora away to her uncle, leaving the governess with Miles, who that night at last talks to her about his expulsion; the ghost of Quint appears to the governess at the window. The governess shields Miles, who attempts to see the ghost. The governess tells Miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost and then finds that Miles has died in her arms, and the ghost has gone.

== Major themes ==
Throughout his career James was attracted to the ghost story. However, he was not fond of literature's stereotypical ghosts. He preferred to create ghosts that were eerie extensions of everyday reality, "the strange and sinister embroidered on the very type of the normal and easy", as he put it in the ''[[New York Edition]]'' preface to his final ghost story, "[[The Jolly Corner]]".

With ''The Turn of the Screw'', many critics have wondered if the "strange and sinister" were only in the governess's mind and not part of reality. The result has been a longstanding critical dispute about the reality of the ghosts and the sanity of the governess. Beyond the dispute, critics have closely examined James's narrative technique for the story. The framing introduction and subsequent [[first-person narrative]] by the governess have been studied by theorists of fiction interested in the power of fictional narratives to convince or even manipulate readers.

The imagery of ''The Turn of the Screw'' is reminiscent of [[gothic fiction]]. The emphasis on old and mysterious buildings throughout the novella reinforces this motif. James also relates the amount of light present in various scenes to the strength of the supernatural or ghostly forces apparently at work. The governess refers directly to ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' and indirectly to ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', evoking a comparison of the governess not only to the character of [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]], but also to the character of Bertha, the madwoman confined in Thornfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaufmann, Professor Linda |title=Discourses of Desire|isbn= 0-8014-9510-5}} See this book for an argument that Bronte was actually the source of the tale, through Mary Sedgwick Benson.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary significance and criticism ==
[[Oliver Elton]] wrote in 1907 that "There is...doubt, raised and kept hanging, whether, after all, the two ghosts who can choose to which persons they will appear, are facts, or delusions of the young governess who tells the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433074965207|title=Modern studies /|last=Elton|first=Oliver|date=1907|publisher=London :}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Wilson]] was another of the earlier proponents of the theory questioning the governess's sanity, positing [[sexual repression]] as a cause for her experiences.{{sfn|Slide|2013|p=103}} Wilson eventually recanted his opinion after considering the governess's point-by-point description of Quint. Then John Silver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, John|title=A Note on the [[Freudian]] Reading of 'The Turn of the Screw'|work=American Literature|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out hints in the story that the governess might have gained previous knowledge of Quint's appearance in non-supernatural ways. This induced Wilson to return to his original opinion that the governess was delusional and that the ghosts existed only in her imagination.

[[William Veeder]] sees Miles's eventual death as induced by the governess. In a complex [[psychoanalytic]] reading, Veeder concludes that the governess expressed her repressed rage toward her father and toward the master of Bly on Miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veeder|first=William|date=August 1999|title=The Nurturance of the Gothic|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/3711133/nurturance-gothic|journal=Gothic Studies|volume=1|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, however, have strongly defended the governess. They note that James's letters, his ''New York Edition'' preface, and his ''[[Notebooks of Henry James|Notebooks]]'' contain no definite evidence that ''The Turn of the Screw'' was intended as anything other than a straightforward ghost story, and James certainly wrote ghost stories that did not depend on the narrator's imagination. For example, "[[Owen Wingrave]]" includes a ghost that causes its title character's sudden death, although no one actually sees it. James's ''Notebooks'' entry indicates that he was inspired originally by a tale he heard from [[Edward White Benson]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. There are indications that the story James was told was about an incident in [[Hinton Ampner]], where in 1771 a woman named Mary Ricketts moved from her home after seeing the apparitions of a man and a woman, day and night, staring through the windows, bending over the beds, and making her feel her children were in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9643165/How-we-all-came-to-love-a-good-ghost-story.html |title=Books: How we all came to love a good ghost story|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eso-garden.com/specials/the_gale_encyclopedia_of_the_unusual_and_unexplained_vol_3.pdf| title=  The Gale Encyclopedia of the Unusual and Unexplained}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 commentary in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Brad Leithauser]] has given his own perspective on the different interpretations of James' novella: &lt;blockquote&gt;All such attempts to 'solve' the book, however admiringly tendered, unwittingly work toward its diminution[; its] profoundest pleasure lies in the beautifully fussed over way in which James refuses to come down on either side... the book becomes a modest monument to the bold pursuit of ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New Yorker|author=Leithauser, Brad|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/10/ever-scarier-on-the-turn-of-the-screw.html|date=October 2012|title=Ever scarier on The Turn of the Screw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to Leithauser, the reader is meant to entertain both the proposition that the governess is mad and the proposition that the ghosts really do exist, and consider the dreadful implications of each.

Poet and literary critic [[Craig Raine]], in his essay "Sex in nineteenth-century literature", states quite categorically his belief that Victorian readers would have identified the two ghosts as child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex in nineteenth-century literature |work= In Defence of T.

== Publication history ==
''The Turn of the Screw'' was first published in the magazine ''[[Collier's]] Weekly'', serialised in 12 instalments (27 January – 16 April 1898). The title illustration by [[John La Farge]] depicts the governess with her arm around Miles. Episode illustrations were by [[Eric Pape]].{{sfn|Orr|2009|p=23}}

'''Theodorus van Hoytema''', or '''Hoijtema''' (18 December 1863, [[The Hague]] - 28 August 1917, The Hague) was a Dutch [[lithographer]], illustrator and graphic designer, known for his book covers and calendars; especially those depicting birds.

== Biography ==
[[File:Het leelijke jonge eendje.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Illustration from&lt;br /&gt; ''The Ugly Duckling'']]
His father was Secretary-General of the Department of Finance.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn3/hoijtema Brief biography] @ Huygens/Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of eight children. Both of his parents died during the 1870s, so he and some siblings moved to Klein Stadwijk, a village in [[Voorschoten]]. There, he received his first drawing lessons from his eldest sister. He attended the [[Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden]] and, together with two of his older brothers, passed an exam that enabled them to find work at a financial firm. Theo, however, was not satisfied with office life and decided to become an artist.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=4180371 Brief biography] @ Christie's.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He began by taking drawing classes at the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague|Royal Academy of Art]]. While there, he drew and painted the stuffed animals at the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie]] in Leiden. As a result, his uncle Adriaan van Oordt, Director of [[Brill Publishers]], was able to get him his first commissions doing scientific illustrations.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; From 1889 to 1890, he became interested in lithography. That same year, he took up temporary residence in a garden house at {{ill|Binckhorst Castle|nl|Kasteel de Binckhorst}}. The following year, after the success of his first picture book about birds (''Hoe de vogels aan een koning kwamen''), he was married and moved to [[Loosduinen]]. The marriage was, however, short-lived and childless, ending in divorce in 1902.

In 1892, he became a member of the [[Haagsche Kunstkring]] and joined [[Arti et Amicitiae]] in 1893.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; That same year, he produced an illustrated edition of ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], followed by several more bird-themed picture books.

He continued to move, restlessly, first to [[Voorburg]] then, in 1897, to [[Hilversum]]. For a time, he stayed with family members in London. His health became fragile and he was hospitalized for much of 1904 and 1905. He also spent a short time at a psychiatric sanatorium. When released, he went to live with a sister in The Hague and remained there, under her care, for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

Despite his illness, it was during this period that he created the calendars that made him famous. His designs also formed the basis for pottery and furniture.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; He and his wife were the models for the main characters in ''Leo en Gerda'' (1911), a novel by {{ill|Aegidius Willem Timmerman|nl}} about the generation of artists who began their careers in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/timm004tims01_01/timm004tims01_01_0016.php Items on Timmerman] @ [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature|DBNL]].&lt;/ref&gt; A street was named after him in 1923, and a monument was placed there in 2009.

'''''This River''''' is a 2016 Canadian short documentary film directed by [[Katherena Vermette]] and Erika MacPherson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/new-documentary-shows-lengths-taken-to-find-missing-1.3746810 "New documentary shows lengths taken to find missing family members"]. [[CBC News]], September 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The film centres on Drag the Red, a volunteer group in [[Manitoba]] who search the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] for the bodies of [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muskratmagazine.com/this-river-documentary-searches-for-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-girls/ "This River Documentary Searches for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women &amp; Girls"]. ''Muskrat'', August 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith has stated that it was Vermette's ''North End Love Songs'' which helped draw her attention to the perspectives of indigenous youth from the North End and the experience of having missing family members.&lt;ref name="Larkins"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larkins|first1=David|title=New doc explores search for missing people|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2016/11/06/new-doc-explores-search-for-missing-people|accessdate=8 November 2016|work=Winnipeg Sun|date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography took place August 8 to 16, 2016, with an all-woman crew documenting the work of Drag the Red volunteer Kyle Kematch. The crew spent much of that time filming from a small fleet of donated boats. The director of photographer was Iris Ng, with Anita Lubosh recording sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2015/10/02/redemption-red-river-woman/|title=Redemption on the Red|last=Lewis|first=Philip|date=2015-10-02|work=NFB/blog|access-date=2017-06-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film received the 2016 Coup de coeur du jury award at Montreal's [[Terres en vues/Land InSights]] First Peoples' Festival and had its public premiere in Vermette's hometown of [[Winnipeg]] on October 5 at the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/local-film-about-tragic-red-river-searches-honoured-at-montreal-festival-389664751.html|title=Local film about tragic Red River searches honoured at Montreal festival|last=King|first=Randall|date=9 August 2016|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[5th Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2017, the film won the [[Canadian Screen Award]] for Best Short Documentary Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Sue|title=Katherena Vermette doc This River wins Canadian Screen Award|url=http://www.quillandquire.com/awards/2017/03/13/katherena-vermette-doc-this-river-wins-canadian-screen-award/|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=Quill and Quire|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''What Brings Us Here''==
Vermette and producer Alicia Smith also created a related [[Instagram]] work, ''What Brings Us Here'', which offers portraits of volunteers behind the community-run Winnipeg search teams the Bear Clan and Drag the Red.&lt;ref name="Cram"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cram|first1=Stephanie|title=Instagram project asks what attracts volunteers to patrol Winnipeg neighbourhoods|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/instagram-project-asks-what-attracts-volunteers-to-patrol-winnipeg-1.3824950|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chua|first1=June|title=Instagram project chronicles search for missing and murdered Indigenous women|url=http://rabble.ca/columnists/2016/11/instagram-project-chronicles-search-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=rabble.ca|date=10 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What Brings Us Here'' features photos by Winnipeg photographers Janine Kropla, Mark Reimer and Karen Asher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8385">The term '''twitter bomb''' or '''tweet bomb''' (also spelled as one word) refers to posting numerous (pejoratively, "[[spamming]]") [[Twitter|Tweets]] with the same [[hashtag]]s and other similar content, including @messages, from multiple accounts, with the goal of [[advertising]] a certain [[Internet meme|meme]], usually by filling people's Tweet feeds with the same message, and making it a "[[Twitter#Trending topics|trending topic]]" on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Joyce2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary C.

== Advertising ==
Twitter bombing may be used for commercial advertising. An early example from {{Nowrap|April 2009}} referred to advertising a [[YouTube]] video series [[Ask a Ninja]].&lt;ref name="ez" /&gt;

== Politics ==
Twitter bombing is one of [[repertoire of contention|the tools]] used in [[Internet activism]], both by mainstream politicians like [[Barack Obama]] and by groups like [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="Joyce2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenCoffey2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Clifford Green|author2=Daniel J. Coffey|title=The State of the Parties: The Changing Role of Contemporary American Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx6VsVR0g-4C&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-9954-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webpronews"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Richardson |url=http://www.webpronews.com/anonymous-plans-24-hour-tweet-bomb-to-fight-cispa-2012-04 |title=Anonymous Plans "24 Hour Tweet Bomb" To Fight CISPA |publisher=WebProNews |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded usage of the Twitter bomb is from August 2008, when it was used by bloggers Liza Sabater and Kenneth Quinnell in response to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] use of the #dontgo [[hashtag]] relating to [[Offshore drilling|offshore oil drilling]].&lt;ref name="kq"&gt;Kenneth Quinnell, [http://floridaspeaks.blogspot.com/2008/08/twitter-bomb.html "Twitter Bomb"], Florida Speaks blog, August 5, 2008, Last accessed on August 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used for other purposes in 2008, but the other meanings have since disappeared.&lt;ref name=ez/&gt;

An example of a Twitter bomb was the campaign organized by online activists in response to a July 31, 2009 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article on [[Hillary Clinton]] that was deemed [[sexist]].&lt;ref name="Joyce2010-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary C. Joyce|title=Digital Activism Decoded: The New Mechanics of Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3AOzoq7VfIC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=30  April 2012|date=30 April 2010|publisher=IDEA|isbn=978-1-932716-60-3|pages=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was used extensively by Barack Obama's campaign staff to encourage his followers to contact Congress and encourage them to reach a compromise during the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011]]. Shortly thereafter, @BarackObama lost about 37,000 followers.&lt;ref name="newser" /&gt;

== Positive Impacts ==
Twitter bombing/spamming can provide exposure to current events that are not being exposed enough from mainstream media. Dhiraj Murthy writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Twitter has received significant media attention in its use to disseminate information during disasters, including the 2008 Mumbai bomb blasts (Dolnick, 2008) and the January 2009 crash of US Airways flight 1549 (Beaumont, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, Dhiraj. "Twitter: Microphone for the masses?." ''Media Culture and Society'' 33.5 (2011): 779.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Linking this with the use of hashtag, see hashtag activism, news and information can be spread around the internet at a rapid pace with the use of hashtags.

== Comparison to online spam ==
The use of the Twitter bomb tactics has been known to misfire, as people might be offended by spamming, or [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]].&lt;ref name=ez/&gt;&lt;ref name="Social media activism and the (in)justice of the mob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.partisans.org/2012/04/social-activism |title=Social Media Activism and the (In)justice of the Mob |publisher=Partisans |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506002256/http://www.partisans.org/2012/04/social-activism |archivedate=2012-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spammers have several goals, which are phishing, advertising, or malware distribution. Unlike traditional online spamming, such as email, Twitter has a limit of only 140 characters per tweet. Therefore, a Twitter bomb often include URLs in their tweets in order to send others users to their malicious pages online.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Jonghyuk, Sangho Lee, and Jong Kim."Spam filtering in twitter using sender-receiver relationship." ''Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection''. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike email spam, Twitter bombs may require participation from their targeted users. Fake accounts are a common source of Twitter bombs. In order to avoid Twitter's spam filters and to overcome their lack of followers, Twitter bombs are often sent as a reply to existing tweets about the same topic. This is done in hopes that the authors of the existing tweets will retweet the response to their own followers, spreading the Twitter bomb before the fake account is deleted.&lt;ref name="masen10" /&gt;

With regards to numbers, an example of a Twitter bomb analyzed in one research paper described how nine fake user accounts produced 929 tweets in 138 minutes, all with a [[URL]] to a political website, presenting negative views on the U.S. politician [[Martha Coakley]].&lt;ref name="masen10"&gt;P. Metaxas, E. Mustafaraj, [http://journal.webscience.org/317/ "From Obscurity to Prominence in Minutes: Political Speech and Real-Time Search"], ''In: Proceedings of the WebSci10: Extending the Frontiers of Society On-Line, April 26-27th, 2010, Raleigh, NC: US (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The message might have reached about 60,000 before being eliminated by Twitter as spam.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;Neil Savage. 2011. [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/3/105332-twitter-as-medium-and-message/fulltext "Twitter as Medium and Message"], ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' 54, no.&amp;nbsp;3 (March 2011), 18–20. [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1897852.1897860 DOI:10.1145/1897852.1897860]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Many Twitter users find comfort in sharing their ideas and thoughts to the general public. Though Twitter can be utilized to spread awareness of a variety of issues and [http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/youthvoices/education-notes/twitter-party-using-twitter-to-raise-awareness-teen-dating-abuse.html causes], many can take advantage and post numerous tweets that may be viewed as spam. Twitter's rule [https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311 page] considers tweets "spam" once a user displays multiple tweets with unrelated hashtags to a certain topic, or continues to post multiple tweets of the same content in one account. Some instances, these tweets can be viewed as trolling once they begin to seek out other Twitter users for arguments about controversial issues.

'''''Witches of East End''''' is a 2011 [[novel]] by author [[Melissa de la Cruz]] and the first entry in her ''Beauchamp Family'' series. It was published on June 21, 2011, by [[Hyperion Books]] and follows a family of Long Island witches struggling against dark forces conspiring against them. ''Witches of East End'' is de la Cruz's first adult novel; she said she wrote it with her [[Blue Bloods (novel series)|Blue Bloods]] audience in mind because "many of them will soon be adults" and the book takes place in the same universe as the ''Blue Bloods'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin|first=MaryAnne|title=Melissa de la Cruz on Writing for Adults|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/melissa-de-la-cruz-on-writing-for-adults_b31227|publisher=GalleyCat|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel currently has two sequels: ''Serpent's Kiss'' (2012) and ''Winds of Salem'' (2013).

A television series adaptation, ''[[Witches of East End (TV series)|Witches of East End]]'', debuted October 6, 2013, on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].&lt;ref name="premieredate"&gt;{{cite web|title=TCA: Lifetime's 'Witches Of East End' Debuts Oct. 6|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/tca-lifetimes-witches-of-east-end-debuts-oct-6/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Joanna Beauchamp has lived off the coast of Long Island for many centuries. She and her daughters Freya and Ingrid are immortal witches, cursed to spend the rest of their days without the use of their substantial powers due to the family's involvement in the [[Salem Witch Trials]]. Joanna has the power to heal and bring the dead back to life. Ingrid can tell the future and weave magical [[knotwork]], while Freya can craft potions and charms. They've spent years hiding their true nature from others, something that provides no small amount of frustration due to how much they want to help others. It's only after Freya becomes engaged to the mysterious Bran (Branford) Gardiner (this character was renamed Dash in the TV series), and somehow becomes unwillingly infatuated with his brother Killian, that the Beauchamps seem to start breaking their curse, and slowly begin to cast magic once again. However one small spell turns into several as the Beauchamps begin to fall into the routine of using magic. It's through this everyday usage that they discover that a mysterious presence is at work within the town, making the women barren, unleashing a strange silvery substance into the waters, and ruining the local wildlife.

As Bran is continually away on trips to promote a charitable organisation that his family runs, Freya is often left alone with Killian. This closeness eventually culminates in her once again sleeping with Killian after he assists her with a busy weekend at the pub she works at. While Freya deals with the guilt from her affair and the feelings that her affair with Killian brings up, Ingrid is conflicted by her own romantic feelings towards local police officer Matt Noble. Despite exhibiting an interest in her, Matt has begun dating a coworker, which irritates Ingrid greatly. The townspeople's ailments and the mysterious silver substance in the water eventually prompts Johanna to seek her estranged husband Norman (this character was renamed Viktor in the TV series) in New York, leaving her daughters alone to deal with a growing unrest in the town as a whole. The family is eventually charged with various crimes involving an attack on a local couple as well as the disappearance of a young woman that was interning at the mayor's office.

The Beauchamps eventually discover that the chaos stems from an old rivalry between [[Loki]] and [[Balder]] over Freya. It's also revealed that the entire family are gods from [[Norse mythology]] and that the silvery substance comes from the breaking down of the rifts between worlds. Freya initially believes that Killian is Loki, here to disrupt her relationship with Bran, only to discover that Bran is actually Loki and that his trips were not for charitable purposes but to encourage the destruction of the gates between the worlds. Freya and Ingrid travel into the rift to stop Loki, managing to barely succeed and return home. Once home, they are told that the Council has noticed their magic and that if they can avoid getting convicted of the crimes against them, they will be free to practice magic once more. The Beauchamps are cleared of all charges, the intern's disappearance and death being a result of the mayor's obsession with her and the attack on a local couple being the actions of Bran. Freya and Ingrid have both begun relationships with their partners, with the book ending as Freya's brother approaching her for assistance in capturing Balder/Killian, who he claims tricked him into being imprisoned for the destruction of the [[Bifröst]], which was done by Balder.

Originally the ''Gruppe der Ungegenständlichen'', they took the name Zen 49 the following year.&lt;ref name="Artfact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artfact.com/features/viewStyle.cfm?genreRef=VHWPZLZ6FK |title=Zen 49 |publisher=Artfact |accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven members were [[Willi Baumeister]], [[Rolf Cavael]], [[Gerhard Fietz]], [[Rupprecht Geiger]], [[Willy Hempel]], [[Brigitte Meier-Denninghoff]] and [[Fritz Winter]].&lt;ref name="Artfact"/&gt; They were joined by [[Bernard Schultze]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/online_az/4:322/?initial=S&amp;artistId=5009&amp;artistName=Bernard%20Schultze&amp;submit=1 |title=Bernard Schultze (German, 1915 - 2005) |publisher=[[National Galleries of Scotland]] |accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
