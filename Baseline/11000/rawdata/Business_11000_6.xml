'''Aaron Fish''' is an entertainment producer and technology creator who lives in Vancouver, BC, Canada, where he serves as President and CEO of Dreams One Entertainment Corporation and Accordios Worldwide Enterprises Inc.

==Early career==
Aaron Fish demonstrated an affinity for music and entertainment production at an early age when he acted as deejay for his elementary and high school graduations.&lt;ref name=art1&gt;''The Georgia Straight'', 30 October  &amp;ndash; 6 November 1987, Dave Watson, "Eran is hardly a Fish out of water"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, at the age of 19, he was hired by Vancouver-based [[CFOX-FM| CFOX-FM (99.3 The Fox)]] where, among other duties, he went on to engineer [[Terry David Mulligan| Terry David Mulligan's]] CKLG morning show.&lt;ref name=art1 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aaron Fish (producer) with Terry David Mulligan and Bryan Adams.jpg|thumb|right|Aaron Fish (center) with then-colleague [[Terry David Mulligan]] (Canadian actor and radio and television personality) and [[Bryan Adams]] (Canadian singer, musician, producer, actor, social activist, and photographer) in the mid-80s]] --&gt;

A turning point in his career began when he started an annual tradition of producing a boat cruise experience for 200 of his high school friends. The successful series of produced events&lt;ref name=art2&gt;''The Province'', 30 April 1987, Tom Harrison, "Louie Louie Is Packing 'Em In"&lt;/ref&gt; led Fish to branch out into various forms of packaged entertainment properties and corporate sponsorship vehicles.&lt;ref name=art1 /&gt;

==Middle career==
In the 80s, Fish expanded his music industry experience, working as a deejay and entertainment coordinator at the 86 Street Music Hall built for the [[Expo 86|1986 World's Fair]] while simultaneously packaging and producing theme parties that sold out from the early to late 80s.&lt;ref name=art2 /&gt; During this time, he started SixStar Attractions Inc. and Fish Entertainment under which he created and produced various entertainment events.

Throughout the 80s, Fish's entertainment vehicles grew in scope and drawing power through sponsorship integration, such as a draw prize for a $13,000 trip for two to 12 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=art1 /&gt;

By 1991, his first of multiple Party 2000 Gala events, inspired by New York-style cabarets, featured a dance floor large enough for 2,000 participants on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref name=art3&gt;''The Province'', 28 December 1994, John Bermingham, "6,000 expected at gigantic bash"&lt;/ref&gt; The Party 2000 series, which successfully drew between 5,000 and 6,000 participants, also grew in scale each year, with the 1994 event including a million-dollar light-and-sound show, a simultaneous broadcast on [[CKZZ-FM|Z 95.3 FM (now CKZZ Virgin Radio 95.3 FM)]], and a one-hour live TV special on the then active U.TV network.&lt;ref name=art3 /&gt;

==Sponsorship integration==
Fish continued to experiment with both his productions and his sponsor integration model throughout the late 90s in preparation for his Millennium New Year's Eve party, dubbed BMW Party 2000. The production was an executive black tie event, selling out 2,800 tickets by mid-October and filling every room in the [[Hyatt Regency]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Vancouver Sun'', 1 January 2000, Charles Campbell, "Simpler Celebrations Usher In New Year"&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMW Party 2000 also integrated brand marketing from 15 corporate sponsors including [[BMW| BMW Group Canada Inc.]], [[The Province| The Province newspaper]] (a [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications Corp.]] company), and the [[Hyatt Regency]], with sponsor advertising integrated across all media platforms and displayed throughout the venue, utilizing a marketing methodology similar to that used to fund sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vancouver Sun'', 22 December 1999, "New Year's extravaganzas fizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current career==
In the 2000s, Fish started Modern Business Discovery Corporation under which he ran his first series of Internet-based events, the Million Dollar Dream Contest, in 2003. A second Dream Contest followed in 2004 with the two productions collectively drawing sponsors including [[Global Television Network]] (a [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications Corp.]] company), [[Ford motor company of canada|Ford Motor Company of Canada]], [[BMW| BMW Group Canada Inc.]], and [[The Province| The Province newspaper]] (a [[Canwest|CanWest Global Communications Corp.]] company).

In July 2008, Fish submitted a provisional patent in the United States for a new Digital Marketing and Revenue Generation system, followed by an international patent filing on July 17, 2009 with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), and then, in 2010 and 2011, multiple national patent filings in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom/Europe.

Fish is currently developing and producing various online and mobile sports, music and entertainment marketing properties as President and CEO of Dreams One Entertainment Co. and Accordios Worldwide Enterprises Inc.

The '''Business Roundtable''' ('''BRT''') is a group of [[chief executive officers]] of major U.S. corporations formed to promote pro-business [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, L. (1991, March 7). The Business Roundtable is mentioned by G. William Domhoff in ''Who Rules America?''  Domhoff argues that the Business Roundtable supports the network of corporate control and influence over the economy, politics, and media.  Perils to conservatives in a conservative court. New York Times, Retrieved from https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D81E3EF934A35750C0A967958260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, A.L. (1993, March 26). Methods in Stock Option Madness. New York Times, Retrieved from https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DC163FF935A15750C0A965958260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, C., &amp; Eckert, C. M. (2000). The right turn in economic policy: Business elites and the new conservative economic. Sociological Forum, 15(2), 312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichtman, A. J. (2008). White Protestant Nation: The Rise of the American Conservative Movement. Atlantic Monthly Press. (p. 338)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Roundtable was founded in 1972 by John Harper, the head of [[Alcoa]], and [[Fred J. Borch]], CEO of [[General Electric]], who were concerned about growing public hostility toward corporations as evidenced by support for government regulation of the workplace environment and about the power of unions to squeeze corporate profits in an increasingly competitive international market. The two CEOs talked with [[John Connally]], [[President Nixon]]'s [[Secretary of the Treasury]], and [[Arthur Burns]], the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], who advised them to set up a lobbying organization that would specifically represent large banks and corporations. Harper was the first president, followed by Thomas Murphy of [[General Motors]], Irving Shapiro of [[DuPont]], and Clifford Garvin of [[Exxon]]. 

The group was formed through the merger of three existing organizations: the March Group, consisting of chief executive officers who met informally to consider public policy issues; the Construction Users Anti-Inflation Roundtable, a group devoted to containing construction costs; and, the Labor Law Study Committee, largely made up of labor relations executives of major companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.org//aboutUs/history.aspx "About Us"], Business Roundtable website&lt;/ref&gt; The group has called itself President Obama's "closest ally in the business community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Business leaders say Obama's economic policies stifle growth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062205279.html |work= |location= |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:Alexander Acosta addresses the Business Roundtable L-17-06-07-A-012 (34994118202).jpg|thumb|U.S. Secretary of Labor [[Alexander Acosta]] addressing the Business Roundtable in June 2017]]
The Business Roundtable played a key role in defeating an [[anti-trust]] bill in 1975 and a [[Ralph Nader]] plan for a consumer protection agency in 1977. It also helped dilute the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act]]. But the Roundtable's most significant victory was in blocking labor law reform that sought to strengthen labor law to make it more difficult for companies to intimidate workers who wanted to form unions. The AFL-CIO produced a bill in 1977 that passed the House. But the Roundtable voted to oppose the bill, and through its aggressive lobbying, it prevented the bill's Senate supporters from rounding up the 60 votes in the Senate necessary to withstand a [[filibuster]].

In fiscal policy, the Roundtable was responsible for broadening the 1985 tax cuts signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan]], lobbying successfully for sharp reductions in corporate taxes. In trade policy, it argued for opening foreign markets to American trade and investment. The [[Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act|Omnibus Trade Act]] of 1988 reflected  the thinking of the Business Roundtable. In 1990, the Roundtable urged George Bush to initiate a free trade agreement with Mexico. In 1993, the Roundtable lobbied for [[NAFTA]] and against any strong side agreements on labor and the environment. It provided the money and leadership for the main pro-NAFTA lobby.

The Roundtable also successfully opposed changes in corporate governance that would have made boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders. In 1986, the Roundtable convinced the Securities and Exchange Commission to forgo new rules on merger and acquisitions, and in 1993 convinced President Clinton to water down his plan to impose penalties on excessive executive salaries. [[Citicorp]] CEO, John Reed, chairperson of the Roundtables Accounting Task Force, argued that Clinton's plan would have had negative effects on U.S. competitiveness. The Roundtable's Health, Welfare, and Retirement Income Task Force, chaired by [[Prudential Insurance]] CEO Robert C. Winters, cheered President Bush's plan, which consisted mainly of subsidies to the health care industry. The nation's health care system works well for the majority of Americans, the Roundtable announced in a June 1991 statement. "We believe the solutions lie not in tearing down the present system, but in building upon it."

In a press release, it said it "strongly supported passage of" the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002, and was "actively working with states on implementation." It has issued press releases, submitted editorials, given congressional testimony, and distributed position advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessroundtable.org//taskForces/taskforce/issue.aspx?qs=6545BF159F849514481138A6DBE7A7A19BB6487BF6B38 "ISSUE: No Child Left Behind"] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Roundtable also acts as a major [[lobbying|lobby]] that aims to extend or maintain administrators' rights/power in large companies. For example, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] adopted the so-called "shareholders’ access to proxy" rule, which aimed to empower shareholders in the proposition and nomination of administrators of big corporations. The Business Roundtable was strongly against that rule, as its president John Castellani reported to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' about removing this rule: "this is our highest priority [...] Literally all of our members have called about this".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/13/AR2010051305288.html&lt;/ref&gt; And they got the upper hand: the SEC rule was finally dropped after intense lobbying and lawsuits.

===Legislation===
The Business Roundtable wrote a letter to members of the House strongly endorsing the [[Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress)]].&lt;ref name=BRTletter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutler|first1=Alexander M.|title=BRT Letter to House on the Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act|url=http://businessroundtable.org/resources/brt-letter-house-customer-protection-and-end-user-relief-act|publisher=Business Roundtable|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Business Roundtable letter, a survey of chief financial officers and corporate treasurers "underscores the urgent need for the end-user provisions" in this bill because "eighty-six percent of respondents indicated the fully collateralizing over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives would adversely impact business investment, acquisitions, research and development, and job creation."&lt;ref name="BRTletter"/&gt; The letter concluded that the Business Roundtable "supports efforts to increase transparency in the derivatives markets and enhance financial stability for the U.S. economy through thoughtful new regulation while avoiding needless costs."&lt;ref name="BRTletter"/&gt;

==Criticism==

The Business Roundtable has been identified by advocates for shareholder democracy and owners' rights as a primary inhibitor of progress in corporate governance, who claim that through its lobbying of the SEC, the NYSE, and other regulatory and self-regulatory institutions, the Business Roundtable has sought to limit shareholders proxy rights and the power to nominate directors. The critics of the Business Roundtable contend that rather than fighting on behalf of stockholders in companies, it has focused purely on increasing executive power and compensation, thereby diminishing return to the owners (shareholders) of these firms.

* Corporate governance pioneer [[Robert A. G. Monks|Robert A.G. Monks]], in his 2007 book [[Corpocracy: How CEOs and the Business Roundtable Hijacked the World's Greatest Wealth Machine -- And How to Get It Back]], argues that the Business Roundtable has been a key player in the steady dilution of shareholder access to the boardroom and that this has contributed to the skyrocketing rates of CEO compensation.
* [[G. William Domhoff]], in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', argues that the Business Roundtable supports the network of corporate control, and influence over the economy, politics, and media.
* In [[The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism]], [[John C. Bogle]], the founder of the [[Vanguard Group]] and author of investing classic [[Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor]], argues that the Business Roundtable is to blame for the failure of recent corporate governance initiatives.
* The [[University of Hawaii]]'s Robert R. Locke, author of Confronting Managerialism, identifies the Business Roundtable as a major contributor to what he calls "Managerialism", the shift in power from owner/shareholders to those who are the manager/agents of firms. His 2011 work, [[Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives Out of Balance]], explores several cases in which the Business Roundtable has opposed changes to corporate governance rules that would have empowered shareholders at the expense of CEOs.

A '''business network''' is a complex network of companies, working together to accomplish certain objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ford (marketing scientist)|Ford, David]], [[Lars-Erik Gadde]], and [[Håkan Håkansson]]. ''Managing business relationships.'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives, which are strategic and operational, are adopted by business networks based on their role in the market. There are two categories of business networks — business associations and company aggregations — that help [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)]] to become more competitive and innovative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/5563/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/pdf Business Networks - Ecorys - European Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Several descriptions of business networks stipulate different types of characteristics:

* A business network is a form of inter-firm cooperation that allows companies, located in different regions or countries, to collaborate together on a basis of common development objectives expressed in a cooperation agreement. The companies decide to join their strengths, share information and create synergies to become more innovative and competitive in domestic and international markets, while keeping their autonomy, not creating a separate legal entity. This cooperation model is suitable for any kind of business activity or sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*A business network is greater than the sum of the individual businesses. It incorporates suppliers, customers, third-party developers, distributors, and others. These third parties generally have a strong reason to support the network and remain active in it.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Word (2009). ''Business Network Transformation: Strategies to Reconfigure Your Business Relationships for Competitive Advantage.'' p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;
* A business network is generic and includes both smart and not-so-smart business networks. A smart business network is defined as a group of participating companies (nodes) that are linked together by one or many communication networks (links). The companies have compatible goals and interact in innovative ways. A smart business network is perceived by each company as increasing its own value and is sustainable as a network over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Smart Business Networks|last=Peter H.M. Vervest, Eric van Heck, Kenneth Preiss, Louis-Francois Pau|first=|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A business network is owned by the business enterprise, where the scope of the network is to support the informational and operational requirements of the business, such as marketing, sales, accounting, and manufacturing departments.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy Lewis (2001) ''Managing Business and Service Networks.'' p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study ==
In the late 20th century, the study of business networks emerged in the field of [[Industrial marketing|industrial market]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Researchers analyzed the transactions and communications beneath the visible flows of products, inquiries, sales visits and negotiations, and beyond the visible growth and prosperity of some companies and failure of others.&lt;ref name="SS 1995"&gt;[[Snehota, Ivan]], and [[Hakan Hakansson]], eds. ''[http://www.impgroup.org/uploads/books/0-415-11570-1.pdf Developing relationships in business networks].'' Londres: Routledge, 1995. p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

Snehota and Hakansson (1995) explain: For more than twenty years, we have analyzed business networks for answers to the many questions about industrial markets. Unlike consumer markets, industrial markets are not generally known to the public, nor to many management scholars. We have been surprised by the complexity of industrial markets and at the same time by the apparent smoothness of their working. Gradually, we have acquired respect for their importance and complexity and learned how they work.&lt;ref name="SS 1995"/&gt;

Another study on business networks was carried out by [[Ecorys]] between 2013 and 2014. This study was specific to [[European Union|EU]]-level business networks and was financed by the [[European Commission]]. The main objective of the study was to investigate and highlight the new forms of inter-firm collaboration and to propose possible measures to support and coordinate them in Europe where and if appropriate. This study included the objectives and categorization of business networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Objectives ==
Business networks have two types of objectives — strategic and operational — that are adopted depending on the role of the business network in the market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Strategic objectives ===
Strategic objectives are focused on long term activities, such as: 

*[[Innovation]]
*[[Internationalization]]
* Foreign matchmaking 

=== Operational objectives ===
[[Operational objective|Operational objectives]] are diverse and include: 

* Provision of legal and financial services 
* Collaboration in regional, national, and international projects
* Increased buying power through joint purchasing 
* Optimization of HR-marketing for recruitment of highly specialized talent 
* Provision of [[intellectual property]] protection

== Categorization ==
Business networks can be divided into two main categories: business associations and company aggregations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Business associations ===
Business associations — also called business networks as business associations — provide member companies with a platform and conditions for cooperation to meet an objective. The companies decide if they want to cooperate to achieve that objective.

Business associations create a [[level playing field]] for cooperation among companies. They have a stable and well-functioning governance structure. The members may pay a fee to the association. In return, the business association monitors and meets the needs of their members and proactively develops and provides new services. This is the key task of business associations.

Business associations provide services that are generally more professional, extensive, and cost effective compared to services offered by individual members.

[[File:Business Network - Associations.png|thumb|Figure 1: Relationship between the business association and its members, and among the members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;]]

In a business association, there is a direct link between the business association (central body) and each of its constituent members. This is displayed with solid bidirectional arrows (refer to Figure 1). The members may or may not choose to cooperate with each other, displayed with dashed lines between companies.

Business associations are further categorized by sector or by location and scope.

=== Company aggregations ===

Company aggregations — also called business networks as company aggregations — are formed by companies, which decide to cooperate and aggregate. Unlike business associations, these companies have already taken the decision to work together on a joint set of objectives.

In a company aggregation, companies collaborate directly with each other without a representative and/or a servicing association. The aggregation of the companies can be formalized through a business contract.

[[File:Business Network - Aggregations.png|thumb|Figure 2: Company aggregations have two forms of cooperation: horizontal and vertical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;]]

Company aggregations have two forms of cooperation: horizontal and vertical. (refer to Figure 2)

* In a vertical aggregation, there is a collaboration between companies that are involved in different stages of the value chain. For example, cooperation between a supplier of [[cotton]], a manufacturer of cotton clothes, a wholesale distributor, and a retailer of cotton clothes.
* In a horizontal aggregation, the collaboration is among companies of the same industry and in the same stage of the production process. For example, many small producers of cotton clothes cooperate and produce together the required number of cotton clothes to fulfill the order of a large marketing company.

== Business network model ==
The characteristics of a business network model are:

* The collaborating companies in a business network are not bound by location, size, sector, or number. They are open to new partnerships that help them to stay competitive.
* The companies focus on a joint objective and agree on the activities and the procedure to achieve the objectives.
* The collaborating companies formalize their agreement through a contract that includes the jointly agreed objectives, activities, procedures, duration, decision process, definition of the parties’ rights, and provisions to enter and exit the contract.
* The structured collaboration resulting from the contract gives the companies the required skills to become more competitive, innovative and global, and gain better economic productivity and performance. It also gives the companies the advantage of [[free riding]].   

Business network companies — that is, platform and network-based companies — outperform traditional companies. Some of the advantages of business network companies are:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/11/what-airbnb-uber-and-alibaba-have-in-common|title=What Airbnb, Uber, and Alibaba Have in Common|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.wharton.upenn.edu/press-releases/2016/06/networks-and-platform-based-business-models-win-in-the-digital-age-according-to-a-new-study-by-the-wharton-school-of-the-university-of-pennsylvanias-sei-center-for-advanced-studies-in-m/|title=Networks and Platform Based Business Models Win in the Digital Age, According to a New Study by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania’s SEI Center for Advanced Studies in Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* More profit 
* Faster growth
* Higher valuations (two to four times) 
* Higher return on investment
* Lower marginal costs

Some companies that follow a business network model include Trepup, [[eBay]], [[Red Hat]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[Uber]], [[TripAdvisor]], [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

== Difference between business networks, clusters, and joint ventures ==

=== Difference between clusters and business networks ===
Clusters are a network of connected businesses, suppliers, and associates in a specific field that are all located in the same geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/business-cluster.html|title=Business Dictionary - Business cluster|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, companies in a business network are not bound by geographical locations or sectors, and can be focused around any specific objective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Difference between joint ventures and business networks ===
A [[joint venture]] is a new legal entity created by two or more companies, generally characterized by [[shared ownership]], shared returns and [[Economic risk|risks]], and shared governance. The companies come together to accomplish a specific task, such as a project or a business activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp|title=Investopedia - Joint Venture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a business network, on the other hand, the autonomy of each of the companies is preserved and no new legal entity is formed. The companies capitalize on the network to create opportunities and expand their individual business interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Clause 49''''' of the Listing Agreement to the [[National Stock Exchange of India|Indian stock exchange]] that came into effect from 31 December 2005.  It has been formulated for the improvement of [[corporate governance]] in all listed companies.

==Background==
In corporate hierarchy two types of managements are envisaged:
 
:i) companies managed by [[Board of Directors]]; and 
:ii) those by a [[Managing Director]], whole-time director or manager subject to the control and guidance of the Board of Directors i.e., he is liable to the Board of Directors and the function of the corporate.

*As per Clause 49, for a company with an Executive [[Chairman]], at least 50 per cent of the board should comprise independent directors.  In the case of a company with a non-executive Chairman, at least one-third of the board should be independent directors.
*It would be necessary for chief executives and chief financial officers to establish and maintain internal controls and implement remediation and risk mitigation towards deficiencies in internal controls, among others.
*Clause VI (ii) of Clause 49 requires all companies to submit a quarterly compliance report to [[stock exchange]] in the prescribed form.  The clause also requires that there be a separate section on corporate governance in the annual report with a detailed compliance report.
*A company is also required to obtain a certificate either from auditors or practicing company secretaries regarding compliance of conditions as stipulated, and annex the same to the director's report.
*The clause mandates composition of an [[audit]] committee; one of the directors is required to be "financially literate".
*It is mandatory for all listed companies to comply with the clause by 31 December 2005.

Corporate Governance may be defined as “A set of systems, processes and principles which ensure that a company is governed in the best interest of all stakeholders.” It ensures Commitment to values and ethical conduct of business; Transparency in business transactions; Statutory and legal compliance; adequate disclosures and Effective decision-making to achieve corporate objectives.In other words, Corporate Governance is about promoting corporate fairness, transparency and accountability.  Good Corporate Governance is simply Good Business.

Clause 49 of the [[SEBI]] guidelines on Corporate Governance as amended on 29 October 2004 has made major changes in the definition of independent directors, strengthening the responsibilities of audit committees, improving quality of financial disclosures, including those relating to related party transactions and proceeds from public/ rights/ preferential issues, requiring Boards to adopt formal code of conduct, requiring [[CEO]]/[[CFO]] certification of financial statements and for improving disclosures to shareholders. Certain non-mandatory clauses like [[whistle blower]] policy and restriction of the term of independent directors have also been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.iiaindia.org/docs/SEBI-Clause%2049-Amendments.doc | title=SEBI-Clause 49-Amendments | accessdate=January 2, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925124739/http://www.iiaindia.org/docs/SEBI-Clause%2049-Amendments.doc | archivedate=September 25, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘Clause 49’ refers to clause number 49 of the Listing Agreement between a company and the stock exchanges on which it is listed (the Listing Agreement is identical for all Indian stock exchanges, including the [[National Stock Exchange of India|NSE]] and [[Bombay Stock Exchange|BSE]]).
This clause is a recent addition to the Listing Agreement and was inserted as late as 2000 consequent to the recommendations of the Kumarmangalam Birla Committee on Corporate Governance constituted by the Securities Exchange Board of India ([[SEBI]]) in 1999. 
 
Clause 49, when it was first added, was intended to introduce some basic corporate governance practices in Indian companies and brought in a number of key changes in governance and disclosures (many of which we take for granted today). It specified the minimum number of independent directors required on the board of a company. The setting up of an Audit committee, and a Shareholders’ Grievance committee, among others, were made mandatory as were the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) section and the Report on Corporate Governance in the Annual Report, and disclosures of fees paid to non-executive directors. A limit was placed on the number of committees that a director could serve on.

==Origins==
In late 2002, [[SEBI]] constituted a Committee to assess the adequacy of current corporate governance practices and to suggest improvements. Based on the recommendations of this committee, SEBI issued a modified Clause 49 on 29 October 2004 (the ‘revised Clause 49’) which came into operation on 1 January 2006.

The revised Clause 49 has suitably pushed forward the original intent of protecting the interests of investors through enhanced governance practices and disclosures. Five broad themes predominate. The independence criteria for directors have been clarified. The roles and responsibilities of the board have been enhanced. The quality and quantity of disclosures have improved. The roles and responsibilities of the audit committee in all matters relating to internal controls and financial reporting have been consolidated, and the accountability of top management—specifically the CEO and CFO—has been enhanced. 
Within each of these areas, the revised Clause 49 moves further into the realm of global best practices (and sometimes, even beyond).

By Circular dated 8 April 2008, the Securities and Exchange Board of India amended Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement to extent the 50% independent directors rule to all Boards of Directors where the Non-Executive Chairman is a promoter of the Company or related to the promoters of the company.

At the end of the first India Corporate Week in December 2009, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued new Corporate Governance Voluntary Guidelines and new Corporate Social Responsibility Voluntary Guidelines.

'''''Delivering Happiness''''' (2010) is a book by [[Zappos]] CEO [[Tony Hsieh]]. It details his life as an [[entrepreneur]], with emphasis on the founding of LinkExchange and Zappos.

==Background==
In 2009, Hsieh began writing ''Delivering Happiness'' over [[Labor Day]] in [[Lake Tahoe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://entrepreneurstechnology.com/interview-with-tony-hsieh-ceo-of-zappos Interview with Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos] ''Entrepreneurs Technology''. February 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote most of the book [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], often completing 3,000 word chunks a day that he would send to his editor in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=footwearnews&gt;Abel, Katie [http://www.wwd.com/footwear-news/reading-tony-hsieh-3091406?full=true Reading Tony Hsieh] ''Footwear News''. June 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While writing the book, Hsieh was still acting [[CEO]] of Zappos as well as a highly sought after corporate speaker. Due to this grueling schedule, he would often write for 20 to 24 hours at a time, sleep for four hours or less, and then resume working. To stay awake, Hsieh says that “we tried coffee. And alcohol. And then coffee and alcohol. We actually put coffee beans in a vodka bottle.”&lt;ref name=footwearnews/&gt; The entire writing process took two and a half weeks.&lt;ref name=throughtheeyes&gt;[http://www.deliveringhappinessbook.com/through-the-eyes-of-our-editor/ Through the Eyes of Our Editor] ''Delivering Happiness Blog''. April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into three sections: Profits; Profits and Passion; and Profits, Passion, and Purpose. It is written in [[narrative]] form and includes short 1-2 page entries from Hsieh's friends and employees. In the first section, Hsieh details his entrepreneurial adventures from when he was young until he was in college. These include his attempt to start an earthworm breeding business at the age of 9, a mail order button business in middle school, and a grille at [[Harvard University]]. After college, Hsieh founded [[LinkExchange]], which he sold to [[Microsoft]] for $265 million two years later. He founded Venture Frogs, an investment fund, of which Zappos was one of the investments.

The second section, Profits and Passion, details Hsieh's involvement with Zappos, beginning with joining the company full-time as CEO in 2000. The third section, Profits, Passion, and Purpose, covers Zappos sale to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], as well as lessons Hsieh learned in public relations and public speaking.

==Release and reception==
Before the release of ''Delivering Happiness'', Hsieh gave away free copies of the book to bloggers in exchange for a review and the ability to give away a free book.&lt;ref name=dotedu&gt;DeNardis, Nick [http://doteduguru.com/id5060-book-review-delivering-happiness.html Book Review: Delivering Happiness] ''Dot Edu Guru''.

'''Downtown Phoenix''' is the [[central business district]] (CBD) of the City of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], [[United States]]. It is located in the heart of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] or Valley of the Sun. Phoenix, being the county seat of [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] and the capital of Arizona, serves as the center of politics, justice and government on the local, state and federal levels. The area is a major center of employment for the region, with many financial, legal, and other national and international corporations housed in a variety of skyscrapers. Major arts and cultural institutions also call the area home. Downtown Phoenix is a center of major league sports activities, live concert events, and is an equally prominent center of banking and finance in Arizona. Regional headquarters for several major banks, including [[Chase Tower (Phoenix)|JP Morgan Chase]], [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)|Wells Fargo]], [[US Bank Center (Phoenix)|US Bank]], [[Bank of America Tower (Phoenix)|Bank of America]], Compass Bank and [[Renaissance Square|Midfirst Bank]] are all located within or close proximity to the area.

The City of Phoenix defines Downtown as the area between 7th Street and 7th Avenue, from McDowell Road on the north to Buckeye Road on the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.gov/urbanformproject/ Urban Form Downtown Project] City of Phoenix&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of downtown development is concentrated in the smaller area surrounding the intersection of Washington St. and Central Ave (which is the point of origin of Phoenix street addresses and numbering).

== History ==

=== Early Downtown ===
In 1870, a meeting was held to select a town site for the influx of pioneers coming to the recently recognized town of Phoenix. 320 acres were purchased for $50 raised by popular subscription. This original site, the whole of the town of Phoenix in that day, encompasses what would presently be the Downtown Core, bordered by [[Van Buren Street (Arizona)|Van Buren Street]] south to Jackson Street, and Seventh Street to Seventh Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.gov/CITYGOV/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214011434/http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html |archivedate=February 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the first survey of the new town, streets were laid out in a grid, with Washington Street as the main east-west thoroughfare.  The north-south streets originally bore Native American tribal names, but were changed to more easily remembered numbers, with everything east of Center Street (later [[Central Avenue Corridor|Central Avenue]]) named as streets and everything west as avenues. The town continued to grow, and was eventually incorporated as a city on February 28, 1881, centered around downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incorporation in 1881|url=http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|work=Out of the Ashes: The History of the City of Phoenix|publisher=City of Phoenix|accessdate=July 28, 2011|authors=Barney, James M.; Goldwater, Barry M.; Williams, Jack|year=1951|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010633/http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|archivedate=April 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1880s the newly incorporated city made many strides toward modernization with the construction of one of the first electric plants in the West as well as the opening of the horse-drawn streetcar line. The [[Phoenix Street Railway]] system was eventually electrified and expanded to several different lines that connected Downtown Phoenix to other neighborhoods and cities in the Valley. Independence Day of 1887 heralded the arrival first Southern Pacific train. This opened up the economy of the young city, as goods now flowed in and out by train as opposed to wagon. As Phoenix became the center of commerce in the territory, the capital was moved to Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bustling 1890s|url=http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|work=Out of the Ashes: The History of the City of Phoenix|publisher=City of Phoenix|accessdate=August 8, 2011|authors=Barney, James M.; Goldwater, Barry M.; Williams, Jack|year=1951|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010633/http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|archivedate=April 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downtown growth===
After Arizona was granted statehood in 1912, the growth of Phoenix exploded from the downtown epicenter. By the 1930s, a modern skyline composed of various commercial buildings began to take shape and Downtown was a dense, compact and pedestrian friendly city characterized by Victorian buildings and ground-floor retail.&lt;ref&gt;Images of America: Downtown Phoenix; Anderson, Mahmuljin and McPherson pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Post-World War II building focused heavily on suburb creation, and this, combined with the rise of the automobile and evaporative cooling, resulted in large population relocation outside of Downtown.&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Phoenix, Arizona#World War II]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

===Redevelopment===
As Phoenix began to recover from the [[Great Recession]], interest in re-energizing the urban core skyrocketed. In contrast to the pre-recession construction boom in the Phoenix area which primarily focused on the construction of low density communities and [[suburban]] office complexes, the most recent boom has been heavily focused on Central Phoenix, with the construction of higher density development, and a renewed interest in local business, [[bioscience]], education, and the arts. Spurred by [[Arizona State University]]’s quickly developing Downtown Campus and a new [[Phoenix Convention Center|Convention Center]], Downtown Phoenix has quickly transformed into an attractive place for businesses. Areas such as [[Lower Grand]], Roosevelt, and the [[Warehouse District]] have seen a massive investment in art, [[adaptive reuse]], and local restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtownphoenixjournal.com/2015/04/14/building-a-vision-for-downtown-phoenix-living/|title=Building a Vision for Downtown Phoenix Living|date=April 14, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[Super Bowl 49|Super Bowl]] was held in Arizona and, unlike the 2008 Super Bowl, many of the major NFL events were held on the streets of Downtown Phoenix, showcasing to the world how the city had transformed its downtown into a lively, thriving community full of creative energy and opportunity. The construction of Phoenix's [[Valley Metro Rail|light rail system]] has stemmed major development projects in Downtown Phoenix along the Central Avenue corridor.

== Attractions ==
Downtown Phoenix has many points of interest, including museums, sports venues, performing arts venues and a thriving art scene.

=== Museums and cultural venues ===

Downtown's museum and cultural attractions include the [[Arizona Science Center]], The Wells Fargo History Museum, the [[Phoenix Art Museum]], the Rosson House Museum, the Arizona Latino Arts and Cultural Center, the [[Children's Museum of Phoenix]] and the Phoenix Center for the Arts.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Phoenix Science Center in Downtown Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Arizona Science Center]] --&gt;

Downtown Phoenix has hosted many major sporting events in recent years. Downtown was the site of the 2015 Super Bowl XLIX Central and NFL Experience, which drew over 1 million people to the city center.&lt;ref&gt;http://downtownphoenixjournal.com/2015/02/25/super-bowl-xlix-brings-record-numbers-downtown/&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Phoenix hosted the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2017 NCAA Final Four Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phoenixfinalfour.com/&lt;/ref&gt; drawing over 400,000 people to [[Margaret T. Hance Park]] and other associated downtown entertainment venues.

=== Performing arts ===
[[Phoenix Symphony Hall]] is home to the [[Phoenix Symphony]]. The Tucson-based [[Arizona Opera]] has staged many of its productions in Phoenix at Symphony Hall. [[Ballet Arizona]] also stages many of its productions at Symphony Hall.

===Notable buildings and landmarks===

Luhrs Building &amp; Tower – Located on Central and Jefferson Avenue, the Luhrs Building was completed in 1924 and was Downtown's first 10-story high rise. In 1929, a second phase of the development resulted in the completion of a 14-story Art Deco tower with Spanish Colonial and Southwest influences. Both buildings have been preserved and house office, restaurants and retail businesses.
 
Hanny's – Opened in 1947, Hanny's was the number one location for men's clothing and fashion until closure in 1986. The building now houses an upscale restaurant and cocktail bar.

The Professional Building (Hilton Garden Inn) – Built in 1932 as the headquarters for Valley Bank and the Maricopa County Medical Society, the building provided Phoenix's first medical offices until the bank took over the entire building in 1939. It is the largest limestone sheathed building in Arizona.

Maricopa County Courthouse (Historic City Hall) – The existing building served as the City Hall from 1928–1994 when the “New” City Hall was completed across the street. The building is an excellent example of Renaissance Revival architecture.

The San Carlos – Constructed in 1927, The San Carlos hotel opened its doors on March 19, 1928 as the first hotel in Phoenix with evaporative cooling. The site was previously the location of the first school house in Phoenix.  Major celebrities have stayed in the hotel, including Betty Grable, Mae West, Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. The hotel now has 12 suites named in honor of its famous visitors and remains a working hotel.
 
The Heard Building – When completed in 1920, the Heard building was Downtown's tallest structure and was financed by Dwight B. Heard, a finance and publishing executive. Since completion, it has housed the Arizona Republic newspaper, a radio station and many office and ground-floor restaurant tenants.

St. Mary's Basilica – Built in Romanesque/Mission Revival style, St. Mary's Basilica is the oldest Catholic parish in Phoenix and the second oldest church in Phoenix. Construction began in its first phase in 1880 and the building and grounds were placed onto the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
 
Chase Field – Opened in 1998, Chase Field is the first stadium built in the U.S. with a retractable roof over natural grass and is the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks Baseball team.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Night in PHX.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Phoenix at night]]
Over twenty-five [[List of tallest buildings in Phoenix|high-rise buildings]] ranging up to 40 stories tall pierce the skyline. Three of the five tallest skyscrapers in the state of Arizona are in Downtown Phoenix. [[Chase Tower (Phoenix)|Chase Tower]], at 40 stories and a height of {{convert|483|ft|m}}, is the tallest. [[U.S. Bank Center (Phoenix)|U.S. Bank Center]]'s 31 floors and {{convert|407|ft|m}} tall is number two. [[44 Monroe]], at 34 floors and a height of {{convert|380|ft|m}} is Phoenix's 4th tallest. The [[Freeport-McMoRan Center]] tops out at 26 floors and is 116.7 meters (382&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The bottom floors of the tower contain a luxury Westin hotel.

The architecture of Downtown offers many examples of 20th-century architectural styles including the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]]-style Security Building and Hotel San Carlos. [[Art Deco]] design can be seen in [[Luhrs Tower]], Hilton Garden Inn (formerly the Professional Building and the Hotel Monroe) and the Orpheum Lofts. [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] was popular from the 1960s to the 1980s and prime examples include [[Chase Tower (Phoenix)|Chase Tower]] and U.S. Bank Center. The short-lived [[brutalist]] style has only one example in downtown Phoenix in the [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)|Wells Fargo Plaza]]. [[Post modern]], with its return to architectural ornamentation, can be seen in the [[Bank of America Tower (Phoenix)|Bank of America Tower]], both towers at the [[Arizona Center]] and, most notably, in the crown of the Phoenix City Hall Building.

The recent trend of urban living has led to the conversion of the 1930s-era Phoenix Title and Trust building to condominiums called Orpheum Lofts; as well as the newly built residential towers [[44 Monroe]]. Taylor Place, two 13-story towers which serve as the new residential community of the Downtown campus of Arizona State University, opened in August 2008. A 19-story, 320 room [https://www.visitphoenix.com/listing/courtyard-by-marriott-downtown-phoenix-(opening-may-2017)/5627/ Courtyard and Residence Inn by Marriott] opened May 2017 and a new [http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/04/13/true-urban-city-downtown-phoenix-frys-grocery-store-breaks-ground/100298576/ Block 23] Fry's urban grocery and mixed-use high-rise will be completed in 2019.

== Historic Heritage Square ==
{{commons category|Heritage Square, Phoenix}}
Historic Heritage Square is part of Heritage and Science Park on the east end of downtown. It encompasses the only remaining group of residential structures from the original town site of Phoenix.

The Lath House Pavilion, although completed in 1980, its design is heavily influenced by combining 19th Century concepts of a botanical conservatory, a gazebo, a beer garden and a pedestrian shopping arcade, all of which were common features of early Phoenix architecture. The Pavilion hosts many national and cultural festivals throughout the year.
The [[Rosson House]] is the cornerstone of a city block dating from the late 19th century. The house has been restored to its Victorian roots and offers tours.
The Duplex, built in 1923, is the youngest of the homes on the block. Its sleeping porches constructed with canvas and wood panels, let in the cool evening desert air.
The Carriage House is located in the center of the Square. It was built as a mule barn for the Teeter House in 1899.
The Silva House, a bungalow with neoclassical revival influences, was built in 1900. The Rose and Crown, an English Pub, now occupies this historical home.
The Bouvier-Teeter House was built in 1899. It is now a Victorian Tea Room.
The Baird Machine Shop was a commercial structure when it was built in 1929. It is now home to [[Pizzeria Bianco]], which has been named by various sources as the best Pizza in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|author=Ed Levine|title=The Road to Pizza Nirvana Goes Through Phoenix|date=July 7, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/dining/07PIZZ.html?ex=1089777600&amp;en=9decbf0191c234a5&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Thomas House was moved to block 15, of Historic Heritage Square in the 1980s to save the home from demolition. This 1909 neoclassical styled building houses Bar Bianco, an adjunct to Pizzeria Bianco.
The Stevens- Haugsten House was built in 1901 as a rental property.  The building is significant for its representation of the historic California bungalow style built around the turn of the 20th century.
The Stevens House, built in 1901 with obvious midwestern influences, now houses The Arizona Doll &amp; Toy Museum.

== Historic neighborhoods ==
Downtown and Central Phoenix are home to several historic neighborhoods ranging from turn-of-the-20th-century Victorian to mid-20th-century modern architecture. Some of them, like the Willo and Encanto-Palmcroft districts, are more established and in demand, while others are still redeveloping. The better-known districts include Coronado, Roosevelt, Encanto-Palmcroft, [[F. Q. Story Neighborhood Historic District|FQ Story]] and Willo.

===Encanto-Palmcroft Historic District===
Rooted firmly in the City Beautiful movement of planning, the Palmcroft and Encanto Districts were developed starting in the late 1920s. With winding lanes, tree-lined streets, lush landscaping and nearby Encanto Park, this neighborhood resembles more of an English suburb than a Phoenician neighborhood. The district contains many larger, period revival manors, marking a time when it was a getaway from the hustle and bustle of early city life. The Encanto-Palmcroft historic neighborhood is diminutive in size with approximately 330 households. Architecture in Encanto-Palmcroft includes Spanish Colonial, Tudor Revival, Cape Cod and Monterey Revival. The proximity of this quaint Downtown Phoenix neighborhood to Encanto Park represents an approach to suburban planning referred to as “City Beautiful” that evolved in Phoenix as a highly successful achievement. It symbolized a romanticized approach to architecture and the houses tend to “look towards each other,” reinforcing a sense of community. Boundaries: Encanto Boulevard south to McDowell Road; Seventh Avenue west to 15th Avenue

===Roosevelt Historic Neighborhood===
Honored with the first distinction of historical designation in the City of Phoenix, the Roosevelt Neighborhood has a history that is rich and deep. From its architectural milestones still visible today, its importance in Phoenix's original booming tourist trade, and its role as one of the first “streetcar suburbs,” Roosevelt has remained a vital community to the city's past, present, and future. It lies bounded by Central Avenue and 7th Avenue from McDowell to Fillmore and is peppered with buildings and homes of architectural significance. It is a true urban neighborhood, with a walkable scale, close proximity to public transportation, and friendly neighborhood cafes and local businesses.

===Coronado District===
Greater Coronado consists of three neighborhoods — Historic Coronado, Country Club Park and Brentwood — and includes over 5,000 households and hundreds of businesses. Centrally located near both State Road 51 and Interstate 10, single-family homes feature architectural styles ranging from California Bungalow and Spanish Colonial Revival to ranches and the occasional modern re-do. Boundaries: Thomas Road south to Interstate 10; State Road 51 west to Seventh Street

===Garfield Historic District===
Developed from 1883–1955, Garfield Historic District contains nearly 800 households and contains primarily modest bungalows, Period Revival homes and the city's largest concentration of “pyramid cottages.” Before becoming a residential community Garfield was part of an extensive agricultural tract. Boundaries: Roosevelt Street south to Van Buren Street; 16th Street west to Seventh Street

===Willo Historic District===
Willo Historic District has been voted one of the top 10 cottage communities in the United States. Bike-friendly and walk-able to light rail, businesses and cultural attractions, Willo was once considered suburban, and predominantly home to those interested in agricultural pursuits. It's still known for its lush greenery. Boundaries: Thomas Road south to McDowell Road; First Avenue west to Seventh Avenue

===Downtown Core===
Light rail, growing academic campuses and renewed demand for urban living has supercharged development in the Downtown Core. The core offers easy access to restaurants, retail and cultural attractions as the true urban center in the Valley. Boundaries: Fillmore Street south to Pacific Railroad; Seventh Street west to Third Avenue

===Grand Avenue===
Grand Avenue's diagonal course breaks up Phoenix's grid and is dominated by local businesses, art studios, converted warehouses, bars, restaurants and restored storefronts. Boundaries: McDowell Road south to Van Buren Street; Seventh Avenue west to 19th Avenue

===Eastlake Park===
The Eastlake Park neighborhood is a traditional African-American enclave in the Downtown area. The main focal point is the park itself, which is the oldest in the city and originally boasted a centrally located lake and pathway. Boundaries: North of Washington Street south to Jefferson Street; 16th Street west to 12th Street

===Grant Park===
Grant Park is one of 13 neighborhoods in the community of Central City South. Latino heritage and culture is strong in Grant Park, and is home to Friendly House Inc., which has served new immigrants since 1915; American Legion Post 41, the first Legion to allow Hispanics as members after World War II; El Portal Restaurant; St. Mary's Catholic Church, which is on the Hispanic historical registry; Grant Park Community Garden; La Canasta Mexican Restaurant and the Grant Park Community Center, famous for its “Midnight Basketball Classic” and other youth programs.
Boundaries: Grant Street south to Buckeye Road; Central Avenue west to Seventh Avenue

===Evans-Churchill Neighborhood and Roosevelt Row===
The Evans-Churchill neighborhood sits directly adjacent to the Downtown Core and is home to Roosevelt Row — the nationally recognized arts district that hosts [https://artlinkphoenix.com/first-fridays/ First Fridays]. Since 1994 this monthly event has grown to become the largest monthly artwalk in the United States. Increasing interest in this area has prompted Roosevelt Row to becoming more pedestrian-friendly and it is supportive of small local independent businesses that give downtown Phoenix character. The area's development is overseen by the non-profit [http://www.rooseveltrow.org/about/the-community-development-corporation-cdc/ Roosevelt Row Community Development Corporation].  With a mix of single-family homes and infill mid-rise developments, this neighborhood serves as a vibrant and arts-focused transitional area between the dense core and surrounding historic districts. Boundaries: McDowell Road south to Fillmore Street; Seventh Street west to Central Avenue

===Central Park===
Emerging businesses, community gardens and thriving programs for adults and youths are the hallmarks of this close-knit neighborhood located south of Chase Field. Attractions include Bentley Projects, the George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center, Central Park Neighborhood Community Center, The Levine Machine and Phoenix Day Child &amp; Family Center, which has served the community since 1915. Central Park Phoenix is one of 13 neighborhoods in the Central City South Community. Boundaries: Lincoln Street south to Buckeye Road; 7th Street west to Central Avenue

===FQ Story===
The quaint F.Q. Story neighborhood consists of over 600 households, most built between 1920 through the 1940s, with architectural styles ranging from Spanish Colonial Revival and Tudor to craftsman bungalows and ranch-style homes. This historic Downtown Phoenix neighborhood is named for Francis Quarles Story, who sold wool in Boston and citrus in Los Angeles before expanding to the Salt River Valley of Arizona. Though never a resident of Phoenix, Story is credited for building the Grand Avenue thoroughfare and the subsequent streetcar line. Boundaries: McDowell Road south to Roosevelt Street; Seventh Avenue west to 17th Avenue

===Warehouse District===
Located just south of the Downtown Core and north of Central City South, the Phoenix [http://www.phxwd.com/ Warehouse District] was the location of early Phoenix's agricultural shipping, historic Chinatown, rail yard and produce distribution centers. The area's remaining period buildings have been top targets for adaptive reuse and are home to several technological and creative-type businesses.  Boundaries: Jackson Street south to Grant Street; 7th Street west to 7th Avenue

== Government and infrastructure ==
Downtown Phoenix is the home of City Hall, Justice Courts, Phoenix Municipal Court, Superior Court of Arizona and Bankruptcy Court. [[United States Postal Service]] operates the Downtown Phoenix Post Office at 522 North Central Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/69201?p=1&amp;s=AZ&amp;service_name=post_office&amp;z=Phoenix Post Office Location – PHOENIX DOWNTOWN]." ''[[United States Postal Service]]''. Retrieved on April 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Phoenix has the [[Valley Metro Light Rail]] which consists of 37 stations throughout 3 different cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Some of the major stations, like [[Van Buren/1st Avenue and Van Buren/Central Avenue stations]], are located in Downtown Phoenix.

== Downtown Phoenix in film and television ==
Mel's Diner, on the outskirts of downtown has been an old Phoenix landmark for decades. It is famous for being the setting for the TV sitcom ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]''.

Many movies have been filmed in Phoenix using downtown locations.

* The 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' features the Downtown Phoenix skyline in the opening shot. Originally [[Alfred Hitchcock]] wanted a helicopter shot to fly through downtown into the window of a hotel, but the shot was changed to a series of pan and fade shots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">'''Emil Corsillo Inc.''' was a company that manufactured [[hairpiece]]s; primarily for the [[entertainment industry]].

==History==
Emil was an Italian immigrant. Together with his wife, Elsie Koch, he founded Emil Corsillo Inc., the famous [[Hollywood]] company that for close to 50 years supplied the entertainment industry in with [[toupee]]s, headpieces, [[wig]]s, and manufactured [[mannequin]] wigs.

Emil was the originator of the mannequin wig in the 1940s. The wigs were made from [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19440109&amp;id=7fgZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7g0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6154,4190241  The Milwaukee Sentinel - Jan 9, 1944] "This pretty young woman is wearing Nylon wig...."&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 1950, Corsillo filed a [[patent]] for his wigs, in particular, the reinforced wig foundation frames (where the fake hair was attached). He was issued with Patent number: 2661749 in December 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/patents/about?id=8mFSAAAAEBAJ Patent details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Hollywood actors that required a hairpiece were clients of the company.  Among them were [[Bozo the Clown]], [[Harpo Marx]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Hal Fishman]], and many more.

Emil died in 1967, but the company continued on into the 1980s when it was closed. The decline in demand was attributed to new technologies and imports.

'''Enrique Omar Suárez''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] union leader, businessman, and politician. He is the previous Secretary General of SOMU (Sindicato de Obreros Marítimos Unidos), the Argentinian union for longshoremen and other maritime workers. He is also the president of Mercante SA and director of Maruba SCA, the largest shipping company in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=¿Quiénes Somos? |work=Maritima Maruba |url=http://www.maruba.com.ar/home.php?pagina=quienesSomos&amp;seccion=quienesSomos&amp;lang=es&amp;editar=false |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629223913/http://www.maruba.com.ar/home.php?pagina=quienesSomos&amp;seccion=quienesSomos&amp;lang=es&amp;editar=false |archivedate=2014-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime friend and ally of the nation’s ruling [[Nestor Kirchner|Kirchner]] family, Suárez has been described as an “ultra-[[Carlos Menem|Menemista]]” who became a “hyper-Kirchnerista.”&lt;ref name="nuestromar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuestromar.org/noticias/transporte_maritimo_y_fluvial_082009_25600_mal_momento_para_maruba|title=Mal momento para Maruba &amp;#124; NUESTROMAR|publisher=nuestromar.org|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been called a “Cristina-ista.”&lt;ref name=lapolit&gt;{{cite web| title =CGT: "Caballo" Suárez rompió con Moyano y ahora es ultra cristinista| work =La Politica Online| date =Apr 10, 2012| url = http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/60269/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source identifies him as “President [[Cristina Kirchner]]’s closest and most powerful ally.”&lt;ref name="sela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sela.org/view/index.asp?ms=258&amp;pagems=26402&amp;item_id=81209|title=SELA - Prensa - Despliegue de Noticias|publisher=sela.org|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is accused by some sources as having been implicated in killings, shootings, narcotics trafficking, and various underworld activities.

He is widely known by the nickname “Caballo” (horse).&lt;ref name=ieco&gt;{{cite web| last =Rossi| first =Antonio| title =Una marítima holandesa se va del país por presión del gremio| work =Clarin| date =Jun 25, 2011| url = http://www.ieco.clarin.com/empresas/maritima-holandesa-pais-presion-gremio_0_505749666.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Suárez was born and raised in [[Monte Caseros]], a town in the province of [[Corrientes]], where he grew up in “a humble family.” His father was a carpenter, and his mother a hairdresser. He had two brothers and a sister. His brother Antonio, who was in turn president of the Social Work SOMU and head of the AFJP (Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones) San José, died under “strange” circumstances but was ruled a suicide.&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt;

==Career==
According to an official biographical account, Suárez began to work in SOMU in 1973 and after that worked in “various firms in the sector,” until 1987, when he was elected delegate and secretary of the Closed Section of SOMU. In 1989, he was elected Deputy Secretary General of SOMU, and in 1992 he was elected SOMU’s Secretary General, a position he holds to this day.&lt;ref name=somu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somu.org.ar/detalle.asp?id=39 |title=Enrique Omar Suárez :: S.O.M.U. |publisher=somu.org.ar |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202219/http://www.somu.org.ar/detalle.asp?id=39 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several accounts state that Suárez was the chauffeur for his predecessor as Secretary General of SOMU, [[Juan Arce]], and that he became Secretary General as a result of a 1989 building takeover by “armed thugs” who were members of the union.&lt;ref name=urg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.com/203601-omar-suarez-el-caballo-antimoyanista?pagination=show|title=Omar Suárez, el &amp;#039;caballo&amp;#039;  antimoyanista &amp;#124; Urgente24|publisher=urgente24.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ambito"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=520963|title=Mar del Plata: mataron al tesorero del gremio pesquero - Ambito.com|publisher=ambito.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; “His arrival in the union was, as is the mark of his entire career, through the gang,” comments one source, which adds that some of the “thugs” that put Suárez in his job continued to work under him, “negotiating with companies and squeezing opponents.”&lt;ref name=pts&gt;{{cite web| last =Aguilar| first =Lucho| title =¿Quién es el ‘Caballo’ Suárez?| work =La Verdad Obrera| date =Nov 15, 2007| url = http://www.pts.org.ar/Quien-es-el-Caballo-Suarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez was a candidate for Provincial Deputy for the New Party.&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt; Businessman [[Adolfo Navajas Artaza]], who was governor of Corrientes in 1969-73 and was denounced for involvement in the disappearance of rural peasants who worked for his company, has been called Suárez’s “political godfather.”&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;

During the Menem years (1989–99), Suárez was “harshly questioned” when he and others signed an agreement on behalf of the Argentine Marines that accepted “poor working conditions” on ships flying under a [[Uruguay]]an [[flag of convenience]].&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

In 2006, Suárez was elected president of the Mutual Association of SOMU. He is also a member of the Commission of Port, Maritime, and River Interests, and is heavily involved in the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labor of the Republic of Argentina (CGT)]]. During his tenure at SOMU, he has also held various positions in the Argentina Confederation of Transport Workers (CATT), the Argentine Maritime Federation (FAMAR), the Caja de Asignaciones Familiares Portuarias y Maritímas (CAFPYMAR) and the Maritime Staff Social Work (OSPM). He is also the founder of la Escuela de Capacitación y Formación Marítima Omar Alberto Rupp, created in 1999 to upgrade the training of maritime workers.&lt;ref name=somu/&gt;

Suárez became director of Maruba in October 2010, after Mercante SA announced that it would acquire a 30% stake in the firm, pending government approval.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

Suárez has been criticized for signing agreements that resulted in lower wages and poorer working conditions and for spending $1.5 million on a recreational camp for union leaders, El Progreso, to which maritime workers are forbidden access.&lt;ref name=pts/&gt;

A 2011 investigative report accused Suárez of having “invented” much of his past, and maintained that it was “a challenge” to determine his actual work history.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

===Smith International, 2010===
After Suárez became director of Maruba in October 2010, he used his position at SOMU to launch “a strong attack” on other companies in the sector, pressuring union shippers in the port of [[Buenos Aires]] to hire Maruba’s tugboats instead of those belonging to the Dutch firm [[Smith International]]. Smith complained to [[Ricardo Lujan]] of the Secretariat for Ports and Waterways, but he refused to act against Suárez. Smith backed off from operations in Buenos Aires and sought instead to increase its presence in the port of [[Bahía Blanca]], but Suárez then put on the pressure there, engineering strikes that made it impossible for Smith to meet its contracts; ultimately, Smith withdrew entirely from the Argentinian market. Its disappearance from Bahía Blanca improved the fortunes of local competitors but the port lost half of its tugboats, which increased the likelihood of delays.&lt;ref name=ieco/&gt;

===Blockade, 2010===
In late 2010, SOMU blockaded [[Paraguay]]an trade in the port of Buenos Aires, and consequently about 7000 containers in transit to Paraguay had to wait nearly a month to be shipped to their destinations. Suárez said that SOMU had “the full support of the Cristina Kirchner administration” in implementing the blockade. He said that it was “a Kirchner government strategy to have Argentine pre-eminence in the Paraná-Paraguay river system”&lt;ref name="mercopress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/12/13/president-lugo-confirms-he-will-not-attend-the-mercosur-summit|title=President Lugo confirms he will not attend the Mercosur summit &amp;mdash; MercoPress|publisher=en.mercopress.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had in fact “explicitly called for a boycott for five days in a gesture of solidarity” with Paraguayan maritime workers.

Suárez later denied having stated that the president supported the boycott. “I never said that. Clarín misrepresented my words," he maintained, and claimed that, on the contrary, he had told Clarín “that the president asked us to lift the blockade.” He said that the blockade had been undertaken in solidarity with Paraguayan maritime workers, because Paraguayan vessels “do not respect minimum and decent working conditions set out in international standards.” The Paraguayan counterpart to SOMU, however, announced that it was opposed to the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/2011/08/argentine-unions-blockade-paraguayan.html|title=Bloggings by boz: Argentine unions blockade Paraguayan cargo ships|publisher=Bloggingsbyboz.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blockade threat, 2011===
In the summer of 2011, Suárez threatened to blockade Paraguayan shipping to overcome “wage asymmetry” in Mercosur and “asymmetry in navigation” on the Paraná. The real goal of Suárez and the Argentinian government, it was claimed, was to compel shippers to switch several billion dollars’ worth of freight from Paraguayan firms to Maruba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eldiario.tristangrimaux.com/id/344318 |title=Omar Suárez y Cristina Kirchner Z - La Nación.com.py |publisher=Eldiario.tristangrimaux.com |accessdate=25 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715003639/http://eldiario.tristangrimaux.com/id/344318 |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bianchi criticisms, 2011===
In September 2011, [[Ivana Maria Bianchi]], a member of the Argentinian Chamber of Deputies, filed a document with the Chamber of Deputies requesting an investigation of Suárez, listing several charges against him. According to Bianchi, Suárez had “launched a powerful attack against shipping, oil and grain” to promote SOMU and Maruba; had unsettled “the waters and the rules of the local maritime sector” with the support of the government of Christina Fernández de Kirchner; had frequently boasted that “everything that moves over the water is mine”; had “carried out a prolonged assault on the fishing industry in Mar del Plata” in 2008 in an effort to force it to yield to union demands; had pressured Maruba’s competitors to cede business to it; had benefited from government favoritism in matters ranging from permits to contracts; and had “loot[ed] the coffers of the National Bank” to increase Argentinian shipbuilding and heighten the Argentinian maritime presence around the globe. Bianchi noted that Maruba, formerly “a company in deep economic problems,” had quickly turned successful as a result of government support, despite owning “virtually no Argentinian vessels” and having debts in ports around the world. Bianchi called Suárez “the most visible and militant face of the merchant marine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4694-D-2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140717145015/http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4694-D-2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2014 |title=H.Cámara de Diputados de la Nación : PROYECTO DE RESOLUCIÓN |publisher=Hcdn.gov.ar |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strike, 2012===
SOMU called a strike on March 6, 2012, demanding higher staffing levels. “We don’t have anything to negotiate,” said Suárez. “They either assign the number of crew members that are necessary or the coast guard can do the work.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/03/wkrs-m13.html|title=Workers Struggles: The Americas - World Socialist Web Site|date=13 March 2012|publisher=Wsws.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the strike paralyzed maritime operations in Argentina, Suárez said: “Not one ship more will enter or leave.” As a result of the strike, [[soy]] futures soared on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL2E8E617020120306|title=UPDATE 2-Argentine dock strike halts scores of grains ships|publisher=Af.reuters.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.K. boycott, 2012===
In February 2012, Suárez announced that SOMU would “cease to provide services to [[U.K.]] vessels as well as those of other nations hired by U.K.-based shipping companies,” owing to escalating tensions between Argentina and the U.K. over the [[Falkland Islands]]. “As workers we are totally offended by...the militarization of the South Atlantic,” Suárez said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/argentina-unions-threaten-boycott-of-uk-vessels-2012-02-14|title=Argentina unions threaten boycott of U.K. vessels|author=Ken Parks|work=MarketWatch|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Suárez has been described as being responsible for “a lush handbook of deaths, drugs, and corruption.” When [[Eduardo Galantini]] was mayor of Monte Caseros, he was reportedly “threatened with death” because the municipality held land that was “coveted by Suárez.”&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt;

Suárez reportedly played a key role in Kirchnerist businessman [[Cristóbal López (businessman)|Cristóbal López]]’s development of a nationwide gambling empire.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

Politician, businessman, and union leader Luis Barrionuevo reportedly financed Suárez’s “Proyecto Corrientes,” a [[Juan Peron|Peronist]] political organization in Suárez’s home province.&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt;

===Papal visit, 2013===
Suárez was one of ten or so members of the delegation that accompanied Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to [[Rome]] to meet with [[Pope Francis]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/126681/cristina-kirchner-to-meet-pope-francis|title=Cristina Kirchner to meet Pope Francis|publisher=Buenosairesherald.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Kirchners==
Suárez and leaders of three other unions agreed in 2006 “to unify their efforts to support and deepen the national recovery policy promoted by the government of President [[Néstor Kirchner]].” Suárez himself stated that the four unions were “in full accordance with the national direction of economic and social policy of President Néstor Kirchner and in full service to the reconstruction of the Argentine maritime sector.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuestromar.org/noticias/politica_y_economia092006_omar_suarez_lo_que_acordamos_fue_la_unidad_total_del_sector_mari|title=Omar Suárez: "Lo que acordamos fue la unidad total del sector marítimos"|publisher=Nuestromar.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez said that “the unity of the major world trade unions” was “terrible news for the nostalgia of [[neoliberalism]]” and represented a success for the economic and social strategy of President Kirchner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laautenticadefensa.net/41059|title=OMAR SUAREZ: APOYAMOS FIRMEMENTE LA CONDUCCION DE HUGO MOYANO AL FRENTE DE LA CGT|author=MatrixWay|work=La Auténtica Defensa|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Javier Iud of San Antonio said in 2007 that it was important to work closely with Suárez on local issues because Suárez is “a ‘soldier’ of Cristina” and an “unconditional ally of CGT as he was under Néstor Kirchner.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informativohoy.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18:vxk47&amp;catid=60:archivo|title=Iud y Gustavo Rubio se reunieron con Omar Suarez por la problemática pesquera|author=Administrator|publisher=Informativohoy.com.ar|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source wrote in 2008 that Suárez was “now identified with Kirchner to the point that in the early months of the presidential campaign, he decorated the port area…with slogans reading ‘With him or with her, Kirchner president, SOMU driving. Omar Suárez.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavaca.org/notas/el-conflicto-del-casino-el-gremialismo-antisindical/|title=El conflicto del casino: el gremialismo antisindical|work=lavaca|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez took part in a labor-union tribute to Néstor Kirchner on the first anniversary of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sutpa.org/2011/10/28/homenaje-a-nestor-kirchner-en-la-cgt/|title=Homenaje a Néstor Kirchner en la CGT|publisher=Sutpa.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez said in May 2011 that Argentina’s “historic” maritime presence around the world was a sign of "the remarkable recovery of Argentina at the hands of our President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,” and was proof that “the Argentine people need four more years of Cristina.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrienteshoy.com/vernota.asp?id_noticia=79310#.U7R3k_mSyfM|title=Omar Suárez: Los argentinos quieren cuatro años más de Cristina Kirchner|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Corrienteshoy.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025164625/http://corrienteshoy.com/vernota.asp?id_noticia=79310|archivedate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=25 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez stated in April 2012 that in the elections for head of the CGT, scheduled for 2013, he would vote for the Kirchner candidate, not for current CGT leader Hugo Moyano, from whom, it was reported, he had recently been maintaining a “certain distance.”&lt;ref name=lapolit/&gt;

Suárez stated in March 2014 that his goal as head of SOMU is “to recover a Néstor Kirchner Argentina that is a matrix of energy and development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agepeba.org/lectura.asp?id=10671|title=Tras una reunión de trabajo, el titular de SOMU afirmó que Mariotto 'tiene toda la aptitud para ser Gobernador'|last=|first=|date=21 March 2014|website=|publisher=Agepeba.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193628/http://agepeba.org/lectura.asp?id=10671|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez has been described as using his contacts with the [[Casa Rosada]] to obtain credit at the National Bank to purchase ships from [[China]].&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

Nowadays he is in jail in Marcos Paz facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tn.com.ar/politica/el-sindicalista-omar-caballo-suarez-seguira-detenido_723172 |title=El sindicalista Omar Caballo Suarez seguira detenido|publisher=tn.com.ar|accessdate=14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Kilzie was born on June 4, 1968.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

In 1993, he graduated from the [[Kuban State Medical University]], with a specialization «Biochemistry». In October of the same year he became the Department Head  at the Moscow Office of ANAS GROUP. In January 1995 he was appointed Managing Director of the Company, whose duties included estimation of competitive environment and competitiveness of manufacture of chemical production at the level of countries, regions of [[Russia]] and countries of the [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], as well as drawing up of reviews on condition and development prospects of separate chemical companies and enterprises.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;[http://lib.fedpress.ru/person/kilzie-fares-n Kilzie Fares N. // FederalPress]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1996, Kilzie was appointed Managing Director of FABA CHEMICALS GmbH, where he was engaged in development and implementation of projects on optimization of direct supplies of raw materials from Russia and [[CIS countries]] with arrangement of project financing, insurance of project risks in Russia.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

In January 2000, he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Creon Advisory Company ([[Moscow]]). Since May 2012 he has been working as the Chairman of the Board of Directors at Creon Energy.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

In 2001, Kilzie established the first independent industry-specific information agency RCC (Russian Chemical Consulting) GmbH, which has become one of the most authoritative corporate information portals in Russia in the area.

In 2002, CREON Group was founded and Kilzie supervised the process of elaboration and estimation of the business plans, worked on technical and economical grounds of investment projects, conducted condition researches and prospects of development of separate oil and gas chemical companies and enterprises, and estimated the commercial potential of new technologies and products (ethylene, propylene, associated petroleum gas, liquefied hydro carbonic gas, liquefied natural gas). In 2012 Kilzie took charge of CREON Energy, which has been the official adviser of the [[Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation]] throughout several years, in particular in the classification of questions regarding liquefied hydro carbonic gas, which is considered to be the basis for customs-tariff regulation.&lt;ref name="tass"&gt;[http://tass.ru/ekonomika/836383 Mayor is againstincreaseofexporttaxesforliquefied hydrocarbon gases till 2017—2018 // Tass. 16.12.2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same 2012, a unique company entered the market - OJSC INVENTRA, focusing on consultancy services exclusively for polymers industry and the related produced products. And 2017 saw the rise of the company CREON Chemicals specializing in agro chemistry and special chemistry.

In 2016, Kilzie took the lead in the establishment of a direct investment fund, CREON Energy Fund SICAV-SIF, focused on investments in the chemicals sector in the Russian Federation. The estimated overall amount of fund investments exceeds €100mln. The Fund is investing in the projects at their initial stage, in growing and expanding Russian and CIS companies, as well as in eco-projects of 'green' economy and alternative energy. The managing company and the unlimited partner is CREON Capital S.a.r.l. with the head office located in [[Luxembourg]]. The partners of CREON Capital are [[Caceis Bank Luxembourg]] S.A., [[Ernst &amp; Young]] S.A., [[Arendt &amp; Medernach]] S.A.

Kilzie speaks fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Arabic]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He is married and has five children.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

== Professional experience ==
As the head of CREON Group, Kilzie took part in management of some projects. Thus, since 2014 CREON Group has acted as the adviser and the operator of the civil-engineering design of methanol manufacturing factory Methanol Serverny which is implemented by NGSK company in [[Ust-Luga]] ([[Leningrad region]]), and is responsible for full-scale project realization.&lt;ref name="KommUst"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2588594 Ust-Luga will accept double methanol // Kommersant. 13.10.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, after several years of cooperation, CREON Group developed a separate Gazprom Eastern Gas Program including a Feasibility Study (FS), offers on production technologies selection and evaluation of licensed extraction facilities. One of the most important factors of this program was an increase in helium production, based on the hypothesis that the development of Chayadinsk and Kovyktinsk extraction facilities might change dramatically the situation on the world gas market. Moreover, the estimation of the Vladivostok LNG was conducted – the liquefied natural gas manufacturing factory (LNG) with the capacity of at least 15 mln tonnes per year.

Within the frames of work on the KazAzot project (unique producer of ammonia and ammonium nitrate in the Republic of Kazakhstan) the efforts of the Group’s consultants were focused on execution of a full technical and technological company audit (due diligence). The strategy for the company’s further development was also elaborated together with the choice of licenses and company’s management schemes. For Sibmethachem company from Tomsk, the Group prepared the site development with due consideration of new tendencies in methanol production. As a result, in 2015, Sibmethachem hit the record production figures for methanol (874 thousand tones). At the instructions of GazpromNeft Company, the CREON Group developed a strategy for the development of oil technologies sector with identification of priority directions in development and analysis of existing and projected products portfolio. At the request of one of the largest oil-producing companies in Russia, the CREON Group worked out the justification of the investment project on the basis of market analysis for benzene production facilities across Russia and the CIS countries, with a forecast up to 2035.

Overall working experience amounts to more than 20 years of experience in investments and international petrochemicals consulting industry, including sixteen years of heading the Board of Directors of CREON Group of Companies.

== Public activities ==
=== Rating of oil&amp;gas companies in Russia performed together with WWF ===
In 2014, together with [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], Kilzie and Creon Energy organized The first [[:ru:Рейтинг экологической ответственности нефтегазовых компаний РФ|Environmental Responsibility Rating of Oil &amp; Gas companies of the Russian Federation]], within Rational Approach Project. Rating included 19 leading companies on volumes of oil and natural gas extraction. Rating grade was calculated for each company as average for 28 rating criteria. According to calculations, Surgutneftegaz Company became the winner; Sakhalin Energy comes second place, Gazprom is on the third place.&lt;ref name="Mirnovostei"&gt;[http://mirnov.ru/lenta-novostej/ekologicheski-reiting-neftegazovyh-kompani-rossii.html Presented environmental rating of oil-and-gas companies of Russia // «Mir novostei». 06.01.2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/economics/2015-04-14/4_oil.html «Common sense» of oil companies // «Nezavisimaya gazeta». 14.04.2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal idea behind this rating is to encourage companies to make good use of [[hydrocarbon]] resources, to ensure [[environmental protection]] and an ecologically and socially responsible business in Russia. This project was developed in order to provide ‘greening’ of the petrochemicals industry, to include environmental operations into the list of priorities of Oil&amp;Gas Companies and to develop regulatory activities amongst the State authorities of the Russian Federation. Today, this is the only rating in Russia that serves as a tool in evaluation of levels of environmental responsibility of all companies extracting more than 1.5 mln tonnes of oil per year.

When the results of the second Rating (end of 2015) were published, the national petrochemical industry journal Neftegazovaya Vertikal admitted that over just one year, the Rating has been recognised by the companies of this industry, which was particularly reflected in the meeting between representatives of the petrochemicals sector at the premises of CREON Group, which was dedicated to the methodology correction. This meeting was attended by representatives of 11 companies, who put forward more than 70 proposals. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) included the Rating in its compilation of corporate practice named “Business. Russia. Ecology. People.” The methodology of the research, which has no equivalents, has already attracted interest from abroad, and this helps in reinforcing a positive image of Russia overseas.&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;[http://new.wwf.ru/resources/news/neft-i-gaz/wwf-opublikovan-reyting-ekootvetstvennosti-neftegazovykh-kompaniy/ WWF: The rating of eco-responsibility of oil and gas companies is published]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/economics/2016-01-18/3_kartblanshe.html CARTE BLANCHE. The price of oil ecology is not a hindrance? // Nezavisimaya Gazeta]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rating is carried out annually and its publication is considered as a major event in the ecological field of petrochemicals sector in the Russian Federation. It includes such companies as [[Arktik Gaz]], [[Bashneft]], [[BelkamNeft]], [[Gazprom]], [[Gazprom Neft]], [[Zarubezhneft]], [[Irkutsk Oil Company]], [[LUKOIL]], [[NNK]], [[Novatek]], [[Rosneft]], [[RussNeft]], [[Salym Petroleum Development]], [[Sakhalin Energy]], [[:ru:Славнефть|Slavneft]], [[Surgutneftegaz]], [[Tatneft]], [[:ru:Томскнефть|Tomskneft]], [[Total Razvedka Razrabotka Rossiya]], [[Transneft]], and [[Exxon NL]].&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

All expenditures for elaboration, estimation, corrections and drawing results are financed by Kilzie.

=== Partnership with the RIAC ===
In October 2015, The Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), in association with the Centre for Strategic Studies (SAM) of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with the support of CREON Group, held an international conference: “Russia &amp; Turkey – Forging Multidimensional Partnership”. The purpose of the conference was to discuss current aspects of collaboration between Russia and Turkey, mechanisms for implementation of joint infrastructure projects, approaches of the two countries to regional problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiancouncil.ru/news/rossiya-i-turtsiya-vmeste-protiv-nestabilnosti/?sphrase_id=70872 Russia and Turkey — together against instability // RIAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, RIAC also held in cooperation with CREON Group and Russian-Chinese Committee for Friendship and Development, the second international conference: “Russia &amp; China – Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations”. The event was held with the support of governmental agencies of the Russian Government and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this conference was to assess the status and development tendencies of Russian-Chinese relations, to identify main achievements and unsettled issues of bilateral cooperation and to prepare proposals for the leaderships of both China and Russia on further development of strategic partnership. The conference became a significant event in the preparation process of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China at the end of June 2016, and received massive coverage in the Russian, Chinese and English-language media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiancouncil.ru/news/zavershilas-konferentsiya-rossiya-i-kitay-k-novomu-kachestvu/?sphrase_id=70871 “Russia &amp; China – Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations” // RIAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International industry-related events ===
In general, for all working experience of the CREON Group and by Kilzie personally, more than 300 business conferences, congresses and forums have been held, dedicated to the issues of extraction and processing of fossil carbon fuels, processing of polymers, and development of agrochemicals. Some of the events have contributed to formation of an innovative vector of development in extracting and recycling branches of the Russian economy.

In 2007 the Group organized the first conference in the country on associated petroleum gas in last decade for subject and complex discussion of problems on effective processing liquefied natural gas (LNG) that subsequently promoted the adoption of law, forcing all oil companies by 2012 to provide 95 percent useful recycling of associated petroleum gas on all of their sites. By the seventh international conference "Associated petroleum gas 2016", a number of leading players of oil branch had already reached recycling level of 95% or have come close to it. However, there were complexities with recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the remote, complex or new sites, and the level of recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) became one of the key parameters of the rating of ecological safety of the oil and gas companies of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2015/09/08/607889-effektivnost-bez-sanktsii Efficiency without sanctions // Vedomosti]&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 witnessed the organization of unique in Russia debatable platform on coverage of helium market, which has no analogues in Europe. As a result development of manufacture of helium in Russia has justified CREON Group predictions about a high export potential of this product. The director for development and strategy of Gazprom Marketing and Trading France Didier Lebo at the conference "Helium 2016" has informed that with the start of Amur gas recycling factory of Gazprom for the first time one source of manufacture will be enough to cover predicted deficiency in the world market at various scenarios within the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogjrussia.com/uploads/images/Articles/March_17/26-29.pdf The helium market in Russia // Oil&amp;Gas Journal Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other key themes of the actions organised by CREON company and Kilzie manufacture may be highlighted LNG/CNG, LCG, [[petrol]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2016/05/05/640022-benzinovaya-stabilnost Petrol stability // Vedomosti]&lt;/ref&gt; [[diesel fuel|diesel]], mineral fertilizers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://echo.msk.ru/blog/rodionoff/1936586-echo/ How does the Russian mineral fertilizer market go through a crisis? // Echo of Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; caustic soda,&lt;ref name="expert2"/&gt; [[sulfur]] and [[sulfuric acid]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://glavportal.com/article/rynok-sery-i-sernoj-kisloty-chto-delat-proizvoditelyam-v-usloviyah-proficita-produkcii/ The market of sulfur and sulfuric acid: what should manufacturers do in the context of surplus products? // Business of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

In March 2012, Creon Company organized «Caustic Soda 2012» Conference. The key issue of the conference was cartel agreement case, initiated by the [[Federal Antimonopoly Service]] (FAS) against manufacturers of [[caustic soda]] and [[chlor]]ic production headed by United Trade Company (UTK).&lt;ref name="expert2"&gt;[http://expert.ru/expert/2012/11/privivka-ot-kartelnoj-chumyi/ Vaccination against cartel plague// Expert Online. 19.03.2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Plastics of Russia award ===
In 2014, Creon Energy Group organized the Plastics of Russia National Forum and established the self-titled award aimed at encouragement of Russian companies and enterprises engaged in the formation of the country's plastic industry. First annual Forum was supported by the [[Ministry of Industry and Trade (Russia)|Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation]] and [[Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation]]. According to Kilzie, plastic converting became the national basis and is able to be a key point for development of a significant segment of the Russian industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Speeches at this forum proved the significant opportunities for development of domestic market of plastics production in all segments of the national economy.&lt;ref name="expert"&gt;[http://expert.ru/2013/10/8/vozmozhnosti-vnutrennego-ryinka-kolossalnyi/ Huge possibilities of the internal market // Expert Online. 08.10.2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="креон"&gt;[http://www.creonenergy.ru/consulting/detailConf.php?ID=110900 Forum “Polymers of Russia — 2014” // Creon Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Plastics of Russia Award had eleven categories for polymer products producers and processors. Among the winners of the award were recognised market leaders (including Kazanorgsintez, Ufaorgsintex, SIBUR and Mosoblgaz companies) together with new market players, such as the recently-opened polymer film plant in Rostov Region Waterfall Pro.

The award ceremony was covered by leading trade publications and business media, including ''Expert'' magazine, the Prime agency for economic news, the PRO-Business television network, and other major organizations.

'''Francisco Uville''' (born '''François Uvillé''', {{circa|1781}} – August 1818) was a Swiss entrepreneur who helped introduce steam engines into the mining industry of Peru.
Through his efforts engines designed and built by the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] were shipped to Peru and carried high over the Andes to the silver mines, where they were used to pump water and hoist ore. Uville went well beyond the mandate agreed with his partners in his arrangements to obtain the equipment.
He died before seeing the enterprise collapse in 1820 during the  [[Peruvian War of Independence]].

==Early life==
Francisco Uville was born in Switzerland. 
He was about 36 years old in 1817, so would have been born around 1781.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=229}}
Uville was a watchmaker by trade.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=36}}

As a young man Uville visited the rich silver mines of the [[Pasco Region]] about {{convert|150|mi}} from [[Lima]], Peru.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=228}}
The Yanacancha ''socavón'', an [[adit]] or tunnel {{convert|5000|ft}} long, had been completed in 1811 to drain the mines into the San Judas lake.
However, on average it was only about {{convert|200|ft}}, below ground level. 
Any mine deeper than the ''socavón'' would have to be drained by hand pumps and buckets.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=34–35}}
When Uville visited them, the silver mines had reached the ''socavón'' level and were now almost abandoned.
It struck Uville that the mines could be worked much deeper by using steam engines to pump out the water.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=229}}

Uville visited England in 1811 and spent a few months in London.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=229}}
He met the [[Boulton and Watt]] engineers, who told him it would not be possible to build low-pressure steam engines that would work efficiently in the thin air of the mountains round Cerro de 
Pasco, around {{convert|14000|ft}} above sea level.{{sfn|Payton|2005|p=91}}
It would also be impossible to make an engine that could be disassembled into pieces small enough to be carried by mule along the narrow track to the mines, which reached {{convert|17000|ft}} above sea level.{{sfn|Dickinson|Titley|2010|p=160}}{{efn|According to a visitor to the mines in 1850, "The Cerro de Pasco mines are about 170 miles from Lima; we crossed a ridge 25,000 [sic] feet high. The mines were about 13,400 feet high above the sea. There was but one road; no wheel vehicle could be used; everything was carried on mules.  Sometimes the road was only 2{{1/2}} feet wide, cut in precipices three or four hundred feet perpendicular: some of the men were afraid to walk, and dared not ride."{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=232}} }}
However, while in London Uville chanced on a working model of Richard Trevithick's high-pressure steam engine, which he saw in the window of the engine maker William Rowley.{{sfn|Don Francisco Uville – Grace's Guide}}
He was struck by the simplicity of its design and how well it was built, and bought the model for 20 guineas.{{sfn|Stuart|1829|p=183}}
He took it back to Peru and successfully tested it at [[Cerro de Pasco]].{{sfn|Payton|2005|p=92}}
Water boiled at this altitude at about {{convert|80|C}} compared to {{convert|100|C}} at sea level, but still produced ample steam and drove the engine as well as it had in London.{{sfn|McGowan|2013|p=61}}

==Cerro de Pasco enterprise==
[[File:Mule track from Lima to Cerro de Pasco by WJ Welch.jpg|thumb|Mule track from Lima to Cerro de Pasco (1874)]]

===Formation===
On 17 July 1812 Uville joined the leading Lima merchants Pedro Abadia and Jose Aresmendi to form a company to drain the mines around Cerro de Pasco.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=31}}
Abadia received two shares for $20,000, while Arismindi and Uville received one share each for $10,000.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=22}}
It was estimated that $30,000 would cover the cost of two engines in England, and Uville was authorised to buy another if he could obtain it on credit.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=23}}
Uville was to arrange to have the machines made in England and erecting in Peru, and in return would get 10% of the net profits. The remainder would be divided in four parts among the shareholders.
If the enterprise succeeded Uville would be credited with $2,000 for the model and with travelling expenses.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=24}}

[[José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa]], Viceroy of Lima, gave his support to the plan.{{sfn|Stuart|1829|p=184}}
On 22 August 1812 the company made a contract with the owners of the Cerro de Pasco mines.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=31}}
The contract, signed by all but three of the mine owners, was for at least two full-size engines to be installed at Santa Rosa.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=36}}
The company would provide the capital to buy and transport the steam engines and to install them over a pit dug down to 
{{convert|111|ft}} below the Yanacancha ''socavón''.
Water filtering in from the surrounding pits would be pumped up to the ''socavón'', allowing silver to be extracted from the lower levels.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=37}}
The company would get 15% of the ore from the Yanacancha and Yauricocha mines, 20% of ore from the other mines, and 50% of the ore from the drainage pit.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=31}}

===Second journey to England===

Uville travelled to Jamaica, then continued to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], which he reached in the summer of 1813.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=229}}
He became ill on the journey.{{sfn|McGowan|2013|p=59}}
He found that Trevithick's first cousin was a fellow passenger, and a meeting between Trevithick and Uville was arranged as soon as they reached England.
Uville spent several months at Trevithick's house in [[Camborne]] while he learned about the use of machinery in mining and visited most of the Cornish mines.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=229}}
Trevithick, who had made improvements to his high-pressure engines, entered a contract with Uville to deliver nine steam engines.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=230}}

On 8 January 1814 Uville made Trevithick a one-fifth partner in the company and guaranteed Trevithick a good percentage of the profits.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=230}}
The partnership was given in exchange for ₤3,000 that was needed to pay overdue bills, and was to be ratified later by the partners in Lima.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=32–33}}
Ulville said he had bills on various people in England, but could not draw on them since the payers were absent from the country.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=32}}
Uville had acted far beyond his authority.
His agreement with Abadia and Aresmendi prohibited bringing in new partners.{{sfn|McGowan|2013|p=96}}
He was only authorised to buy two engines, plus a third on credit.{{sfn|Directors of the Peruvian Mining Company|1825|p=23}}
He had spent more twice the authorised amount.{{sfn|McGowan|2013|p=96}}

===Delivery of engines===
[[File:Trevithick High Pressure Steam Engine - Project Gutenberg eText 14041.png|thumb|Trevithick High Pressure Steam Engine]]
The engines were built for about ₤10,000 and shipped for Lima on a south sea whaler that left on 1 September 1814.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=230}}
There were four 33&amp;nbsp;hp pumping engines, four 10&amp;nbsp;hp winding engines, and a smaller engine to be used by the mint in Lima.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=37}}
There also four spare boilers, pitwork for the engines and other equipment.{{sfn|Payton|2005|p=92}}
Uville sailed with the engines accompanied by the Cornish engineers Thomas Trevarthen of [[Crowan]], Henry Vivian, of Camborne and William Bull of [[Chacewater]].{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=230}}
Transporting the equipment from the coast to Cerro de Pasco took much longer than expected, in part because the Indian communities along the way would not provide the necessary manpower.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=37}}
However, William Bull put the first steam engine  into operation at the Santa Rosa mine near Cerro de Pasco on 27 July 1816.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|pp=230–231}}
The test was satisfactory.
A pit {{convert|17|ft}} deep was emptied in 21 minutes, and then began filling with water from the surrounding mines.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=37}}
The official report to the Viceroy, published in the Lima ''Gazette'' in August 1816 said,
{{blockquote|Immense and incessant labours and boundless expense have conquered difficulties hitherto deemed insuperable; and we have, with unlimited admiration, witnessed the erection and astonishing operations of the first Steam Engine. It is established in the royal mineral territory of Taüricocha in the province of [[Tarma Province|Tarma]]; and we have had the felicity of seeing the drain of the first shaft in the Santa Rosa mine, in the noble district of Pasco. We are ambitious of transmitting to posterity the details of an undertaking of such prodigious magnitude, from which we anticipate a torrent of silver that shall fill surrounding nations with astonishment.{{sfn|Stuart|1829|p=184}} }}

A winding engine was installed beside the pump engine at Santa Rosa, and saved much labour in hauling up the ore from the drainage pit as the water was lowered.
A vein of coal had been found to supply fuel.
Six months after the Santa Rosa pump had been started a second pump was working at the Yanacancha mine, and rapidly drained the mine.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=238}}

===Difficulties and death===
[[File:PSM V12 D276 Richard Trevitchick.jpg|thumb|Richard Trevithick]]
Richard Trevithick sailed for Lima on 20 October 1816 on a south sea whaler, with a Mr. Page of London and James Saunders of Camborne, an engine maker.
He bought with him a furnace to be used in purifying the silver by sulphur.
He reached Lima on 6 February 1817.{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=231}}
The ''Lima Gazette'' of 12 February 1817 reported Don Ricardo Trevithick's arrival, saying, "This professor can, with the assistance of the workmen who accompany him, construct as many engines as are necessary in Peru, without any need of sending to England for any part of these vast machines. The excellent character of Don. R. Trevithick, and his ardent desire for promoting the interests of Peru, recommend him in the highest degree to public estimation, and make us hope that his arrival in this kingdom will form the epoch of its prosperity, with the enjoyment of the riches enclosed in it ..."{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=239}}

The machinery in Cerro de Pasco had developed various problems that the Cornish craftsmen could not fix until Trevithick arrived.
Trevithick managed the repairs, and supervised installation of a second pumping engine at the start of 1818.
Uville and Trevithick began to argue about control of the company which was struggling badly from lack of capital and lack of fuel for the machines.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=38}}
Uville claimed that it was only through his efforts that steam engines had been brought to Peru, demanded complete control of the mining operation, and made every effort to undermine Trevithick's position.{{sfn|McGowan|2013|p=131}}
Trevithick left the mines in disgust, but turned back when he heard of Uville's death.{{sfn|McGowan|2013|p=132}}
Uville's death in August 1818 was "in consequence of the cold penetrating air of the Cordilleras on coming out of the mines in a strong perspiration."{{sfn|Trevithick|1872|p=246}}

==Later events==

With Uville dead, Trevithick was placed in full control of the mines.{{sfn|Skempton|2002|p=724}}
The fuel problem was solved when rich coal seams were found near to the pumping site, and by the end of 1819 there were three pumping engines in operation and the future of the company seemed secure.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=38}}
However, the Peruvian War of Independence disrupted operations. 
On 27 October 1820 Cerro de Pasco was occupied by a patriot army under General [[Juan Antonio Álvarez de Arenales]].
At the start of December royalist forces recaptured Cerro de Pasco, but on 9 December Arenales defeated the royalists.
This was the start of four years of fighting in the region.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=38}}
The mines were taken and retaken, skilled workers fled or were conscripted, and silver production came to a halt.
Operations resumed at the mines in 1825, but only one pumping engine was working.
In 1828 a boiler burst and the last engine was abandoned.{{sfn|Fisher|1975|p=39}}

'''Franck Muller''' (born July 1958) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[watchmaker]]&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company of the same name. The brand of watches carries the slogan "Master of Complications". Franck Muller's watches are worn by various celebrities, among them [[Demi Moore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/2008/10/29/who-says-time-has-to-be-in-order-the-franck-muller-crazy-hou.html |title=Who Says Time Has To Be In Order?

Franck Muller [[timepiece]]s are famous for their fusion of "modern" style, mostly inspired by American watches from the thirties, like "Elgin tonneau", and traditional Swiss watch manufacturing.

==Biography==
Franck Muller was born in 1958. He spent his childhood in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] with his Italian mother and Swiss-born father. When 15, he enrolled in a watchmaking school.
In the early 1980s, he graduated from the Watchmaking School of Geneva ({{lang-fr|Ecole d'Horlogerie de Genève}}). Afterwards, he began repairing top-quality pocket [[watch]]es. Close to an independent watchmaker by the name of [[Svend Andersen]], Franck Muller became responsible for handling watches from the collection of [[Patek Philippe]]. 
Most of the clientele were private individuals and museums. While he was working with complicated timepieces, he became passionate about their mechanisms and began to think of building his own workshop.

Soon after, in 1984, Franck Muller designed his own [[tourbillon]] [[wristwatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hourology.com/store/franck-muller.html |title=Franck Muller |publisher=Hourology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211234543/http://www.hourology.com/store/franck-muller.html |archivedate=2011-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, few watchmakers were capable of creating such complicated timepieces, among them [[Patek Philippe]] and [[Vacheron Constantin]]. The private clients of Franck Muller continued to come for new timepieces, and thus his business started growing. 
The House of Franck Muller opened in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterjackson.co.uk/franckmuller.html FRANCK MULLER] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713163033/http://www.peterjackson.co.uk/franckmuller.html |date=July 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his ultra complicated timepieces instantly became famous in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. Today, his factory, which is also the headquarters of Franck Muller, produces a limited number of watches for private clientele. Franck Muller's collections include a variety of designs and price ranges.
Now the company has five sites ([[Genthod]], [[Lajoux (Switzerland)|Lajoux]], [[Les Bois]], [[Plan-les-Ouates]], [[Meyrin]]) and 570 official retailers.

The company's estimated total sales (in 2010/2011) were €290 million in watches with an average unit price of €38,000.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt;

==World premieres==
Franck Muller is also known for its "World Premiers". Each year, the manufacturer launches at least one new line of timepieces, featuring something special and exclusive, that has never been seen before in the watchmaking industry. The first such world premiere was launched in 1993. The watches had a [[double chronograph|split seconds]] [[chronograph]], a [[minute repeater]], and a [[perpetual calendar]]. In addition, the watches included an indicator showing the internal temperature.

==Notable products==
Notable{{who|date=June 2013}} timepieces include ''Revolution2'', ''Revolution3'', ''Crazy Hours'', and ''Colour Dreams''. Further examples of Franck Muller's watches include the Endurance, which is a simple chronograph, the ''Master Banker'', which is a tonneau-shaped watch capable of multiple time zone indication, and the ''Curvex Minute Repeater Tourbillon'', whose production is limited to 25 pieces.

'''George Herbert Patterson''' (1890–1968) was a pioneering Australian advertising executive who established an agency group that dominated the Australian advertising industry throughout much of the 20th century. His eponymous agency was the largest in the country from the 1930s until the 1980s. Patterson was Chairman of the agency from 1934 until 1954.

==Early life==
One of four children born to John Alfred Patterson (d.1899) and Frances Julia Rogers, he was educated at Carlton College, [[Parkville, Victoria]]. His mother died when he was fifteen and George went out to work help support his sisters. He took a position at Thomas McPherson &amp; Son as an office boy, but within three years had become advertising manager.&lt;ref name="adbonline"&gt;http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150671b.htm ADB online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels and war service==
In 1912 he travelled to London to see how ad agencies operated there, but he was unimpressed with what he saw of English practices and headed for New York where he worked for a time &lt;ref&gt;Crawford p23&lt;/ref&gt;

His initial attempt to enlist in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] at the start of World War I was unsuccessful on medical grounds. He joined the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps|Australian Army Medical Corps]] serving in Egypt (1915–16) and later with the Australian Army Pay Corps on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] (1916–17).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=235502 George Patterson at the AIF Project&lt;/ref&gt; He had the rank of sergeant when was discharged from the army on 3 January 1918 and returned to Melbourne.&lt;ref name="adbonline" /&gt;

==Advertising career==
In 1917 he moved to Sydney and set up his own agency. In 1920 he met Norman Catts who was a big name in the fledgling advertising industry in Sydney, being elected president of the Second Advertising Convention of Australia in 1920. The two merged their interests into the Catts-Patterson agency which was Australia's largest agency throughout the 1920s. Clients included Palmolive, [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] and later the [[Dunlop Rubber]], [[Berlei]], [[Gillette (brand)|the Gillette Safety Razor Co.]] and [[Pepsodent| Pepsodent Australia.]]&lt;ref name="yaffa"&gt;http://www.yaffa.com.au/adnewsAOTY/hof/hof_patterson.html Ad News Hall of Fame 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Catts and Patterson split in 1934. Patterson bought a small business named Griffin, Shave &amp; Russell and formed the George Patterson agency. Patterson was known for an ability to get close to his clients' businesses &lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/advertising Crawford Dictionary of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; being a director of clients [[Gillette (brand)|the Gillette Company]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and later [[Peek Frean]] and Hartford Fire Insurance.&lt;ref name="yaffa" /&gt; During the 1930s Patterson researched the latest international trends in radio advertising during his extensive travels.

In 1938 the agency established an innovative radio production outfit – the Colgate-Palmolive Radio Unit – which produced branded content. During World War II it created campaigns for government bonds and troop entertainment programs featuring stars of the day such as [[Roy Rene]], [[Jack Davey]] and [[Bob Dyer]].&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Patterson worked tirelessly for the [[Australian Red Cross]] Society, directing their publicity functions from 1940 onwards. He was a member of the Red Cross's New South Wales divisional council (1940–68), and on the national council (1941–68). He chaired the Red Cross's rehabilitation (social service) and was made an honorary life member of the national council in 1961. During World War II Patterson was an air-raid warden at [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]] his home suburb in Sydney. He maintained a savings plan for agency staff who were away on active duty.&lt;ref name="yaffa" /&gt;

==Retirement==
He retired due to ill-health in 1952 and was succeeded as CEO by his stepdaughter's husband Bill Farnsworth. Farnsworth maintained the George Patterson Agency's leadership position and was at its helm until 1971. Like his father-in-law he was a dominant force and a respected leader of the advertising industry in Australia.

Patterson's autobiography, ''Life Has Been Wonderful'' was published by Ure Smith Sydney in 1956. He followed this with two books on trout fishing, ''Chasing Rainbows'' (1959) and ''Angling in the Andes'' (1961).&lt;ref name="adbonline" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Patterson's first wife, whom he married after his service in World War I, was Maud Rigby, née Raybould. Born in 1881, Rigby was eight years older than her husband. A widow, she came to the marriage with a daughter. They had another who died in infancy and then a son.

He married a second time in 1961, wedding 62-year-old widow Florence Mary Stonelake, née Mason. Stonelake had been Patterson's nurse. They remained married until Patterson's death on 19 December 1968.&lt;ref name="adbonline" /&gt;

==Accolades==
In 2009 Patterson was included in the inaugural 12 inductees to Ad News Magazine's, Australian Advertising Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaffa.com.au/adnewsAOTY/halloffame.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213230823/http://www.yaffa.com.au/adnewsAOTY/halloffame.html |archivedate=13 February 2011 |df= }} Ad News Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HortaPharm B.V.''' is a cannabis research and development business in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/163/1/335.full.pdf+html The Inheritance of Chemical Phenotype in Cannabis sativa L.(HortaPharm B.V., 1075 VS, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The business was founded by David Paul Watson in 1990. He was soon joined by David W. Pate and eventually Robert C. Clarke. They obtained the first license issued by the Dutch government to permit a ''Cannabis'' research facility in the Netherlands. HortaPharm B.V. has a partnership with [[GW Pharmaceuticals]] to develop ''Cannabis'' varieties for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwpharm.com/23july1998.aspx Details released of collaboration between GW Pharmaceuticals and Hortapharm medicinal cannabis,]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeding==
Using selective breeding and production control, HortaPharm created ''Cannabis'' strains that produce virtually single cannabinoids, approximately 98% [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] or [[cannabidiol]], relative to the total of other cannabinoids present.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Marijuana and Medicine | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Marijuana_and_Medicine.html?id=8E3NXew8MIUC | author=Janet E.

{{Contract law}}
An '''illegal agreement''', under the [[common law]] of [[contract]], is one that the [[court]]s will not enforce because the purpose of the agreement is to achieve an illegal end. The illegal end must result from performance of the contract itself. The classic example of such an agreement is a [[contract killing|contract for murder]].

However, a contract that requires only legal performance on the part of each party, such as the sale of packs of [[Playing card|cards]] to a known gambler, where [[gambling]] is illegal, will nonetheless be enforceable. A contract directly linked to the [[gambling]] act itself, such as paying off gambling debts (see [[proximate cause]]), however, will not meet the legal standards of enforceability.  Therefore, an employment contract between a [[blackjack]] [[Croupier|dealer]] and a [[speakeasy]] manager, is an example of an illegal agreement and the employee has no valid claim to his anticipated wages if gambling is illegal under that [[jurisdiction]].

In ''[[Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;''Bovard v. American Horse Enterprises'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA3/201CA3d832.htm 201 Cal. App. 3d 832, 247 Cal. Rptr. 340] (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal for the Third District]] refused to enforce a contract for payment of [[promissory note]]s used for the purchase of a company that manufactured drug paraphernalia. Although the items sold were not actually illegal, the court refused to enforce the contract for [[public policy]] concerns.

In [[Canada]], one cited case of lack of enforceability based on illegality is ''Royal Bank of Canada v. Newell, 147 D.L.R (4th) 268 (N.S.C.A.),'' in which a woman forged her husband's signature on 40 [[cheque]]s, totalling over $58,000. To protect her from prosecution, her husband signed a letter of intent prepared by the bank in which he agreed to assume "all liability and responsibility" for the forged cheques. However, the agreement was [[unenforceable]], and was struck down by the courts, because of its essential goal, which was to "stifle a criminal prosecution." Because of the contract's illegality, and as a result voided status, the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.

Contracts in [[restraint of trade]] are a variety of illegal contracts and generally will not be enforced unless they are reasonable in the interests of the contracting parties and the 
public.

Contracts in restraint of trade if proved to be reasonable can be enforced.  When restraint is placed on an ex-employee, the court will consider the geographical limits, what the employee knows and the extent of the duration.  Restraint imposed on a vendor of business must be reasonable and is binding if there is a genuine seal of goodwill.  Under common law, contracts to [[Price fixing|fix prices]] are legal. ''Sole supplier'' ("solus") agreements are legal if reasonable. Contracts which contravene public policy are void.

'''Jaime Zóbel de Ayala y Pfitz''', [[Philippine Legion of Honor|PLH]] (born 1934), also known as '''Jaime Zóbel''', is a prominent [[Spanish Filipino|Filipino]] businessman, [[philanthropist]] and [[Art photography|art photographer]]. He is the chairman emeritus of [[Ayala Corporation]]. He has received numerous awards for business leadership, philanthropy and photography.

==Early life and family==

Zóbel was born in 1934 to Alfonso Zóbel de Ayala (1904-1967) and Carmen Pfitz y Herrero (1909-1999). His siblings are Maria Victoria ("Vicky") and Alfonso Jr. ("Alfonsito"). He is a grandson of [[Enrique Zobel de Ayala|Enrique Zóbel de Ayala]] and Consuelo de Ayala.

He is married to Beatriz Miranda. Together they have two sons ([[Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala|Jaime Augusto]] and [[Fernando Zobel de Ayala|Fernando]]) and five daughters (Beatriz Susana ("Bea Jr."), Patricia, Cristina, Monica and Sofia).

==Education==

After early education in the Philippines, Zóbel attended [[Harvard University]], where he graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts in architectural sciences.  He attended the Advanced Management Program in the Far East, conducted by the Faculty from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]] in [[Baguio]], [[Philippines]] in 1963.

==Business career==

Zóbel joined Ayala y Compañía in 1958 as executive assistant upon the invitation of his father. His father placed him under the wing of his cousin [[Enrique Zobel|Enrique]] and uncle Col. Joseph McMicking. As an executive assistant in the company, he took down notes during management meetings and gradually learned the ropes of the family business. He was later transferred to the training section of the insurance companies of the Ayala group.  In 1975, he became president of Filipinas Life Assurance Company (now, BPI-Philam Life Assurance Corporation). In 1984, he succeeded Enrique, as chairman and president of [[Ayala Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/starweek-magazine/330709/jaime-zobel-de-ayala-artist-businessman&lt;/ref&gt; Zóbel successfully steered Ayala through the tense, final years of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] administration. In 1988, the real estate division was spun off as [[Ayala Land|Ayala Land, Inc.]] Ayala Corporation also ventured into new businesses, like automotive (Ayala Automotive Holdings Corporation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111172325/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zóbel stepped down as president of Ayala in 1994 and was succeeded by his son, Jaime Augusto. He continued as chairman until his retirement in 2006 and became the chairman emeritus of Ayala since.

==Photography==
Zóbel joined the Camera Club of the Philippines in the mid-1970s and began taking photography more seriously.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/143833/don-jaime-zobel-de-ayala-zen-and-now&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first Filipino amateur photographer to be confirmed “Licentiate” by the [[Royal Photographic Society]] of the United Kingdom, and has received similar commendations from the French and Spanish governments for his contributions to art and culture. He exhibits regularly in the Philippines and abroad, and has produced several critically acclaimed books. He continues to break new ground in art photography with explorations in various art media.

==Diplomat==

Between 1970 and 1975, Zóbel was the Philippine ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]] in [[London]] and the Scandinavian countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">'''Jean-Baptiste Bouchette''' (5 July 1736&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 28 April 1804) was a French [[Canadians|Canadian]]  merchant, mariner, and militia and naval officer.
&lt;ref name="dcb"&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/bouchette_jean_baptiste_5E.html |title=Bouchette, Jean-Baptiste |first=W.A.B. |last=Douglas |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouchette established a fishing business in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] around 1760 and by 1765 was a well established merchant in [[Quebec City]]. In that year he established a partnership with Scottish emigrants [[John Purss]] and [[James Johnston (1724-1800)|James Johnston]] to establish a trading post to serve the fur and fishing industries in the Gulf.&lt;ref name="dcb"/&gt;

In 1773, Bouchette married Marie-Angélique Duhamel, daughter of Captain Julien Duhamel (1723-1778) and Marie-Angelique, daughter of Francois Dupolo Duval and Marie-Anne Boucher de la Bouteillerie (1675-1762). Madame Bouchette's father, like himself, was a native of [[Saint-Malo]] who settled at [[Quebec City]] in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1837.qc.ca/1837.pl?out=article&amp;pno=5594 Famille de Duhamel]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bouchettes were the parents of nine children, including Colonel [[Joseph Bouchette]].,&lt;ref name="dcb"/&gt; who surveyed and described both the lower and upper province.&lt;ref name="Review Yearbook p 198-211"&gt;Royal Military College of Canada - Review Yearbook (Kingston, Ontario Canada) - Class of 1958 p 198-211&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouchette fitted out and armed his own schooner for His Majesty's service during the American War.&lt;ref name="Review Yearbook p 198-211"/&gt; In 1775, Bouchette's schooner was armed to assist in the defence of Quebec against the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|American invasion]]. It served as one of the escort vessels for the convoy evacuating [[Montreal]]. She was burned by the rebels. When the convoy became trapped due to unfavourable winds, Bouchette piloted a small boat to help General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] and [[Charles-Louis Tarieu de Lanaudière]], his [[aide-de-camp]], escape the American batteries.

In gratitude, Bouchette was granted a commission in an artillery company and on 28 April 1776 he was made a lieutenant of militia and given command of an armed [[sloop]] ''Hope''. He served during the siege of Montreal, 1775-6.  On 11 September 1777 he was made a master and [[commander]] and captained the ''Seneca'', which patrolled the [[Great Lakes]] on Lake Ontario.&lt;ref name="dcb"/&gt;

Bouchette was discharged in 1784. By 1788 Bouchette had returned to private life in Quebec, but it was not to last long. In 1791 he returned to [[Lake Ontario]] reappointed as master and commander in the Provincial Marine and by 1802-04 was the senior officer on the lake.&lt;ref name="Review Yearbook p 198-211"/&gt;

Bouchete became increasingly disillusioned with the military and in 1803, after a confrontation with a senior officer, he was brought in front of an inquiry which upheld three charges against him. Bouchette returned to Quebec and died on 28 April 1804.&lt;ref name="dcb"/&gt;

==Biography==
Sobisch was born in [[Buenos Aires]] and moved to [[Neuquén, Argentina|Neuquén]] as a young boy with the military family of his father, [[Carlos Sobisch]]. He studied in Neuquén and Buenos Aires, then moved to [[Trelew]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] as a young man to work in a friend's design company. He became a graphics operator and [[typesetter]], later establishing his own company. He completed his military service in [[Sarmiento, Chubut]].

Sobisch assisted his [[Peronist]] father in founding the [[Neuquén People's Movement]] in 1961, following him into politics. The party won the Neuquén city elections in 1983 after the return of democracy and Sobisch became mayor, taking took a leading role in renewing the party. He also led the [[Independiente de Neuquén|Club Atlético Independiente]] [[football club]] from 1971.

Sobisch was elected governor of the province in 1991, serving until 1995. He took over the leadership of the party in 1997. He won again as governor in 1999 and 2003, with 57% of the vote, his term expiring in 2007 when he stepped down. 

Sobisch led the founding of the Movement of the United Provinces, a new, conservative party, and was the movement's candidate for the Presidency in 2007. He had previously formed a centre-right alliance with [[Mauricio Macri]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=688802&amp;aplicacion_id=12 ''La Nación'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; although it did not survive Macri's alliance with [[Ricardo López Murphy]] (who is not on good terms with Sobisch); López Murphy was a conservative presidential candidate in both 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-62562-2006-02-04.html ''Página/12'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=818595 ''La Nación'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Remerafuentealba.JPG|left|thumb|160px|A T-shirt commemorates the assassinated school teacher, Carlos Fuentealba.]]

Sobisch is also seen as an ally of former [[Justicialist Party]] President [[Carlos Menem]] and had hoped to become the candidate of those Peronists opposed to President [[Néstor Kirchner]]. Following a scandal in his home province, concerning the April 7 death of local teachers' union member [[w:es:Carlos Fuentealba|Carlos Fuentealba]] (who was reportedly fired upon by provincial police during a protest despite being unarmed), Sobisch was largely shunned by disgruntled Peronists who mainly backed [[Alberto Rodríguez Saá]]. Sobisch was, however, backed by crime victims' rights activist [[Juan Carlos Blumberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/10/13/elpais/p-01518644.htm ''Clarín'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Sobisch and his running mate, [[Jorge Asís]], gained 284,161 votes in the [[Argentine general election, 2007|presidential elections]], amounting to 1.56% of the national vote, in sixth place. His wife of 38 years, Liliana Planas, died on December 22, 2009, after falling from their ninth story Neuquén apartment building, in what local coroners determined to be a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/12/22/um/m-02105990.htm ''Clarín'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judgment summons''', in [[English law]], a summons issued under the [[Debtors' Act of 1869|Debtors' Act 1869]],&lt;ref&gt;Regnal 32 &amp; 33 Vic., c. 62&lt;/ref&gt; on the application of a creditor who has obtained a judgment for the payment of a sum of money by instalments or otherwise, where the order for payment has not been complied with. The [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] summons cites the defendant to appear personally in court, and be examined on oath as to the means he has, or has had, since the date of the order or judgment made against him, to pay the same, and to show cause why he should not be committed to prison for his default. An order of commitment obtained in a judgment summons remains in force for a year only, and the extreme term of imprisonment is six weeks, dating from the time of lodging in prison.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Judgment Summons |volume=15 |page=541 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[debtor]] has once been imprisoned, although for a period of less than six weeks, no second order of commitment can be made against him in respect of the same debt. But if the judgment be for payment by instalments a power of committal arises on default of payment for each instalment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

However, if an order of commitment has never been executed, or becomes inoperative through lapse of time, a fresh commitment may be made.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Imprisonment does not operate as a satisfaction or extinguishment of a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land or goods of the person imprisoned in the same manner as there had been no imprisonment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  In this regard the judgement summons procedure may be seen as a more extreme—because of the threat of imprisonment—version of the procedure under the [[Civil Procedure Rules]]&lt;ref&gt;CPR Part 71&lt;/ref&gt; procedure to obtain information from judgment debtors.

A judgment summons may now be served by post in keeping with other [[Civil Procedure Rules]] actions but, if this option is chosen, then a commitment order cannot be obtained unless: (a) he appears at the hearing; or (b) it is made under section 110(2) of the [[County Courts Act 1984|Act]].&lt;ref&gt;CCR O. 28 r. 2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications for these are now made under [[County Court]] rules Order 28.  There is a standard Civil Procedure Rules practice form&lt;ref&gt;Form N342&lt;/ref&gt; which may be used to apply for the issue of the summons.  The current fee for issue is £100.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Fees Guide EX50 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim Moo-sung''' (born 20 September 1951) is a [[South Korea]]n politician as a member of the [[Liberty Korea Party]]. He was previously the [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] leader from 2014 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Saenuri Party elects Rep.

==Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/south-korean-politician-kim-moo-sung-suitcase-push-viral-video-entitled-middle-aged-men-a7753041.html|title=Politician's suitcase incident goes viral for summing up entitled middle-aged men|date=2017-05-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

Kim graduated from [[Joongdong High School]] in Seoul in 1970. He graduated from [[Hanyang University]] in 1976, majoring in business administration. He also took courses on public policy in [[Korea University]] in 1999.

Kim received honorary doctorate degrees from the following institutions: Doctor of Policy from [[Pukyong National University]] (2003), Doctor of Public Administration from [[Korea Maritime and Ocean University]] (2006) and Honorary Doctor of Political Science from [[Dongguk University]] (2015).

==Political career==
Kim was first elected to the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] representing the [[Nam District, Busan|Nam District]] of [[Busan]] in [[South Korean legislative election, 1996|1996]] as a member of the then-ruling [[New Korea Party]]. He was subsequently elected three more times from the same district and in [[South Korean legislative election, 2008|2008]] was forced to run as an independent after losing renomination from his own party. He again failed to win renomination for the same constituency in [[South Korean legislative election, 2012|2012]] and temporarily left politics between 2012 and 2013. He ran as the [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] candidate in a by-election held in [[Yeongdo District]], [[Busan]], and won his fifth term in the National Assembly in 2013. In 2014, he was elected leader of the ruling Saenuri Party. However, he resigned in April 2016 after the defeat of Saenuri Party in the National Assembly.

=== Potential candidacy for presidency ===
In a 2015 interview, Kim said he was "not yet qualified to be president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/702732.html |title=Kim Moo-sung says he’s not yet qualified to be president|newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]] |location= |publisher= |date=August 1, 2015 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, he suspended his presidential campaign process and declared that he would joint the impeachment process against President [[Park Geun-hye]].

==Controversy and in popular media ==

=== "Charcoal" skin color remarks ===
Kim faced criticism for comparing the skin color of a black Nigerian student to that of charcoal briquettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Rep. Kim Moo-sung sorry for skin-color joke |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/12/116_193519.html |newspaper=[[The Korea Times]] |location= |publisher= |date=December 18, 2015 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229195936/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/12/116_193519.html |archivedate=December 29, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized to the [[Yeungnam University]] student on 18 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saenuri chief apologizes for racist remark|url = http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151218000803|website = www.koreaherald.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== "No look pass" ===
Kim went viral both in Korea and abroad after he was filmed at an airport arrival area. He slid over a bright light green suitcase manner to his assistant without having looked over where he was passing the suitcase off to. This prompted him to be featured on international media outlets, as well as criticized by some as looking elitist and condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/south-korean-politician-kim-moo-sung-suitcase-push-viral-video-entitled-middle-aged-men-a7753041.html|title=Politician's suitcase incident goes viral for summing up entitled middle-aged men|date=2017-05-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/06/06/south-korean-politician-criticized-for-no-look-luggage-toss-at-seoul-airport.html|title=South Korean politician criticized for 'no-look' luggage toss at Seoul airport|date=2017-06-06|work=Fox News|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family during Japanese Occupation ===
During World War II in the period of Japanese Occupation, Kim's father was a collaborator who reported urged Koreans to make donations to support Japan's war efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/opinion/seouls-colonial-boomerang.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/702704.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and working life==

Östling was born in [[Luleå]]. After graduating with a [[Master of Engineering|Master of Engineering degree (M.Eng.)]] from the [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden]], and a [[Bachelor of Economics|Bachelor of Economics degree (BEcon)]] from [[Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law]],&lt;ref name=Leif /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt; he came in 1972 to the Scania AB division in [[Saab-Scania]], where he advanced through a variety of positions. Among other things, he was responsible for long-term planning before he was appointed head of Scania AB in the [[Netherlands]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=Leif /&gt; In 1989 he was appointed head of the Scania and in 1994 when Scania broke out of the [[Saab Scania|Saab Scania group]] and became an independent corporation, he was appointed CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of directors|url=http://www.skf.com/my/our-company/organization/corporate-governance/board-of-directors/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Östling left his post as CEO of [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] (which includes Scania AB) 2012 in connection with controversial statements that trade unions have no right of veto for a possible relocation of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leif Östling går emot fackens vetorätt|url=https://www.svd.se/leif-ostling-gar-emot-fackens-vetoratt/om/leif-ostling|publisher=SvD|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Östling continued on 1 September 2012 to a position in Volkswagen AG until September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leif Östling Joins Modular Management Board|url=https://modularmanagement.com/about-us/news/|publisher=Modular Management|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteranen tar ut svängarna|url=https://weekend.di.se/intervjuer/veteranen-tar-ut-svangarna|publisher=Di Weekend|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Scania's former main investor [[Investor AB]] in the year of 2000 agreed that Scania AB would merge with their biggest competitor [[Volvo Trucks]], Östling opposed that merger, just as in the fall of 2006 he had opposed German [[MAN SE|MAN's]] plans to buy Scania AB.&lt;ref name="Sveriges TV" /&gt; When the [[EU Commission]], referring to the [[European Union competition law]] ([[Volvo Trucks]] / [[Scania AB]] would practically have a monopoly on the truck market in the [[Nordic countries]]), stopped the merger between [[Volvo Trucks]] and [[Scania AB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Commission prohibits Volvo's acquisition of its main competitor Scania|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-257_en.htm|publisher=European Commission, EU|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Östling won that battle and was able, with support from Scania's new owner [[Volkswagen]],  to remain in Scania as [[CEO]]. Also, the [[MAN SE]] bid for takeover was rejected by the main shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scania shareholders reject MAN bid|url=https://www.ft.com/content/346cd5a0-467a-11db-ac52-0000779e2340|publisher=Finacial Times|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scania board members reject VW-bid - Radio Sweden|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5812440|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Östling could continue as CEO after the Annual general meeting in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scania Minutes of the general meeting|url=https://www.scania.com/group/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/Scania_AGM2007_Minutes__tcm10-164981_tcm40-50041.pdf|publisher=Scania|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2017 Östling participated in the [[SVT]] TV program ''[[Uppdrag granskning]]'', which showed that he had placed money abroad to avoid [[Taxation in Sweden|Swedish taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svenskt Näringslivs ordförande har förmögenhet utomlands|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/svenskt-naringslivs-ordforande-har-formogenhet-utomlands|publisher=SVT|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish business boss steps down in 'what do I get for my taxes' row|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20171122/swedish-business-boss-leif-ostling-steps-down-in-what-do-i-get-for-my-tax-money-row|publisher=The Local|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also his comment in connection with that, "Here you pay 20-30 million a year, what the hell do I get for the money?", was considered inappropriate from a chairman of the [[Confederation of Swedish Enterprise]].&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish Business Chairman Resigns Amid Paradise Papers Link|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/swedish-business-chairman-leif-ostling-resigns-amid-paradise-papers-link/|publisher=ICIJ|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svenskt Näringslivs ordf: Vad fan får jag?|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/kqz5k/svenskt-naringslivs-ordf-vad-fan-far-jag|publisher=Aftonbladet|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Östling commented later on the following discussion with "We have got a very narrow sense of corridor in Sweden if all political parties consider the political system to have unlimited taxation rights without the right of citizens to question how the money is used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrinestorn talar ut om hoten|url=https://weekend.di.se/intervjuer/industrinestorn-talar-ut-om-hoten|publisher=Di Weekend|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Östling has said that he believes it is "genetically conditioned" that so few women enter the engineering profession. He has also expressed his belief that the threat of [[global warming]] has been exaggerated and that the phenomenon is possibly caused by natural processes, which completely opposes the consensus in the research community that the current climate change is caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sju klassiska Leif Östling-citat|url=https://www.svd.se/sju-klassiska-leif-ostling-citat#sida-3|publisher=SvD|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific consensus: Earth's climate is warming|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/|publisher=Global Climate Change, Nasa|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes and awards==

Sus casas eran las dos más poderosas y las que atraían mayor clientela de los campos vecinos. Pero junto a ellas se fueron formando otras más modestas, como las de Washington Lithgow... y la de Don Francisquito Bisonó. (...) La aldea nativa empieza a servir de asiento a numerosos establecimientos comerciales que la convierten poco a poco en una pequeña villa de extraordinaria actividad económica, desproporcionada con su tamaño. Entre esos establecimientos figuran el de Don Alberto Asencio, el de Don Miguel Mercado, el de Francisquito Bisonó y el de Don Juan Caridad Bisonó.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ivonne Haza]], a renowned national [[soprano]] from [[San Pedro de Macorís]].

North Sydney is located 3 kilometres north of the [[Sydney central business district]]&lt;ref&gt;Gregorys Street Directory, Gregorys Publishing Company, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and is the administrative centre for the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[North Sydney Council]].

==History==
[[Indigenous Australian|Aborigines]] on the southern side of [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney Harbour) called the north side ''warung'' which meant ''the other side'', while those on the northern side used the same name to describe the southern side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Attenbrow |first1=Dr Val |title=Place Names Chart |url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/place-names-chart |website=Australian Museum |publisher=Australian Museum |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first name used by European settlers was ''Hunterhill'', named after a property owned by [[Thomas Muir of Huntershill]] (1765–1799), a Scottish political reformer. He purchased land in 1794 near the location of north pylon of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] is now located, and built a house which he named after his childhood home. This area north to [[Gore Hill, New South Wales|Gore Hill]] became known as [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The township of St Leonards was laid out in 1836 in what is now North Sydney, bounded by what is now Miller, Walker, Lavender and Berry Streets. By 1846 there were 106 houses here and by 1859, the commercial centre had extended from [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]] to Miller Street. A bus service operated by Jeremiah Wall ran between Milsons Point and ''North Sydney Shops'', and North Sydney thus developed its own identity.

The North Sydney municipality was incorporated in 1890 and after naming disputes, ''North Sydney'' was settled upon. The post office which opened in 1854 as St Leonards was changed to North Sydney in 1890. The first public school which opened in 1874 as St Leonards was renamed North Sydney in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

North Sydney underwent a dramatic transformation into a commercial hub in 1971–72. In this period no less than 27 skyscrapers were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/NOR/NOR.htm Sydney Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trams===
{{main|Trams in Sydney}}
The history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods – the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909, when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the third until construction of the Cahill Expressway on the eastern side of Sydney Harbour Bridge and the wider closure of the system in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;D Keenan: ''The North Sydney lines of the Sydney tramway system''. Transit Press November 1987 {{ISBN|0-909338-05-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which commenced at the original Milsons Point Ferry wharf, located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred St (now Alfred Street South), Junction St (now Pacific Highway), Blue St and Miller Sts to the [[Ridge Street Tram Depot|engine house and depot in Ridge St.]] It used cable grip cars called "dummies" and un-powered trailer cars.

A feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] (the only one in Australia), and the tracks over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Trams ran from Blue St, North Sydney over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway, then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now road lanes), through a tram platform at Milsons Point railway station, before descending underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station.

'''Ralph Henry Fonseca''' (born 1949) is a [[Belize]]an politician and a member of the [[People's United Party]].

== Political history ==
In 1984, he became a candidate for the House of Representatives in [[Queen's Square (Belize House constituency)|Queen's Square]], running against attorney and city councillor [[Dean Barrow]]. He lost and returned to private life until 1989, when he was appointed a Senator and Minister of State in Finance and Leader of Government Business in the Senate until 1993.

In [[Belize legislative election, 1993|1993 elections]] he won in the newly created [[Belize Rural Central]] constituency despite the PUP's close overall loss. He repeated this victory in 1998 and 2003. He served in Cabinet as Minister of Budget Management, Investment and Home Affairs until 2003, when he was moved to Finance again while keeping Home Affairs. Beginning in 2006, he was in charge only of Home Affairs. He became the PUP's national campaign manager in 1985.

Fonseca was undecided as to whether he would seek a fourth term in the [[Belizean legislative election, 2008|February 2008 election]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.bz/bzered.html &lt;sub&gt;The UDP Guardian on Fonseca's chances after 2007 village council elections (partisan)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=5208 &lt;sub&gt;Godfrey Smith of the PUP on whether Ralph should run&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but he subsequently decided to contest his constituency. He was defeated, in what was considered an upset, by the UDP's [[Michael Hutchinson (politician)|Michael Hutchinson]], a relatively unknown candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6604 "Red, red, red!!!"], Amandala Online, February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February, the PUP announced that Fonesca had resigned as PUP campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-6050--27-27--.html "Former Belize prime minister steps down as party leader"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423055140/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-6050--27-27--.html |date=2008-04-23 }}, Caribbean Net News, February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and education==
Fonseca attended [[St. John's College, Belize|St. John's College High School and Sixth Form]] before going to university in [[Canada]] to major in [[information technology]], specialising in systems analysis and control data. He is married with three children. Fonseca reportedly loves diving and fishing. Fonseca is a cousin of former PUP leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Francis Fonseca]].&lt;ref name="cousin"&gt;[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=10566&amp;frmsrch=1 "Francis Fonseca on Why He Wants to Lead the PUP"], [[Tropical Vision Limited]], February 25, 2008. (accessed 25 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Fonseca's younger brother, [[David Fonseca (politician)|David]], served as Mayor of [[Belize City]] from 1999 until 2006.&lt;ref name="dfobit"&gt;[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=32315 "Former Bze. City Mayor David Fonseca Takes His Own Life"], [[Tropical Vision Limited]]. (accessed 4 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonseca's only son, Ralph Fonseca Jr. was killed in a motor accident on 11 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nembhard|first=Anita|title=Freak accident kills two Ralph, Jrs.|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-political work ==
Before going to Canada, Fonseca acted as an assistant general manager at the [[Texaco]] oil company in Belize. In Canada, he was employed in various capacities of information technology. After returning to Belize, he worked as managing director for Belize Brewing Ltd., Hilllbank Agroindustries and Consolidated Electricity Services. Sandwiched between these jobs were posts as Chairman of the former Belize Electricity Board, now Belize Electricity Limited, and the Telecommunications Authority, now [[Belize Telemedia|BTL]]. Presently he serves as a consultant in the petroleum, mining, airline, and shrimping industries.

== Criticism ==
As Minister of Finance, Fonseca popularized the policy of growth economics, which proposes to develop Belize's economy through privatization of assets and encouraging foreign investments, which in turn is supposed to create jobs for Belizeans. Supporters argue that Growth Economics is behind Belize's consecutive gains in total growth; detractors say any benefits from growth economics only accrues to PUP interests and in reality Fonseca has damaged Belize's international reputation due to high debt and poor economic indicators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=5484 &lt;sub&gt;Amandala editorial on growth economics and Belize's present troubles&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He has further been accused of practicing official corruption, granting favors to party supporters in return for shares in the profits. However, claims either way cannot be measured.  

Fonseca has a notably tense relationship with certain media houses antagonistic to his policies. The [[Amandala]] and [[KREM Radio]], who under chairman [[Evan X Hyde]] had been in partnership with the PUP since 1994, claimed to have ended that relationship under pressure from Fonseca.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=5546 &lt;sub&gt;Amandala editorial: Message to the Blue People.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tropical Vision Limited]] Channel 7, managed by Jules Vasquez, has also come under fire by Fonseca for a perceived bias against him.

      <comment>/* Origins and background */ I do not thinl you can say that scholars "generally" hold that Penrose made a substantive contribution; two scholars have advanced this view, but the reality is that such a view is widely dismissed by scholars more generally; an article about RBV is simply not the place to debate Penrose's contributions to management theory; editors who want to do so should put their comments on Penrose's article directly</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18683">The '''resource-based view''' ('''RBV''') is a managerial framework used to determine the strategic resources with the potential to deliver comparative advantage to a firm. These resources can be exploited by the firm in order to achieve sustainable [[competitive advantage]].

Barney's 1991 article "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" is widely cited as a pivotal work in the emergence of the resource-based view. However, some scholars argue that there was evidence for a fragmentary resource-based theory from the 1930s. RBV proposes that firms are heterogeneous because they possess heterogeneous resources, meaning firms can have different strategies because they have different resource mixes.

The RBV focuses managerial attention on the firm's internal resources in an effort to identify those assets, capabilities and competencies with the potential to deliver superior competitive advantages.

==Origins and background==

During the 1990s, the ''resource-based view'' (also known as the ''resource-advantage theory'') of the firm became the dominant paradigm in strategic planning. RBV  can be seen as a reaction against the positioning school and its somewhat prescriptive approach which focused managerial attention on external considerations, notably [[Porter's five forces analysis|industry structure]]. The so-called positioning school had dominated the discipline throughout the 1980s. In contrast, the emergent resource-based view argued that the source of sustainable advantage derives from doing things in a superior manner; by developing superior capabilities and resources. [[Jay Barney]]'s article, "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" (1991), is seen as pivotal in the emergence of the resource-based view.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prahalad | first1 = C. K. | last2 = Hamel | first2 = G. | year = | title = The Core Competence of the Corporation | url = | journal = Harvard Business Review | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 79–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of scholars point out that a fragmentary resource-based perspective was evident from the 1930s, noting that Barney was heavily influenced by Wernerfelt's earlier work which introduced the idea of resource position barriers being roughly analogous to entry barriers in the positioning school.&lt;ref name="priem1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based 'View' a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 20–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Pandian | first2 = J.R. | year = | title = The Resource-Based View Within the Conversation of Strategic Management | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 363–380 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250130505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars suggest that the resource-based view represents a new paradigm, albeit with roots in "Ricardian and Penrosian economic theories according to which firms can earn sustainable supranormal returns if, and only if, they have superior resources and those resources are protected by some form of isolating mechanism precluding their diffusion throughout the industry."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, A. and Kipley, D., "Resource-Based View," in: Matthew R. Marvel (ed), ''Encyclopedia of New Venture Management,'' Sage Publications, 2012, p. 397, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781452218571.n158 &lt;/ref&gt;  While its exact influence is debated, Edith Penrose's 1959 book ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' is held by two scholars of strategy to state many concepts that would later influence the modern, resource-based theory of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Penrose's (1959) "Contributions to the Resource-based View of Strategic Management", Yasemin Y. Kor and Joseph T. Mahoney, ''Journal of  Management Studies'' 41:1 January 2004 0022-2380 http://www.business.illinois.edu/josephm/Publications/jms_kor%20and%20mahoney%20(2004).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBV is an interdisciplinary approach that represents a substantial shift in thinking.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The resource-based view is interdisciplinary in that it was developed within the disciplines of economics, ethics, law, management, marketing, supply chain management and general business.&lt;ref&gt; Hunt, S.D., "A General Theory of Business Marketing: R-A theory, Alderson, the ISBM Framework and the IMP Theoretical Structure," ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 41, 2013, pp 283-293&lt;/ref&gt; 

RBV focuses attention on an organisation's internal resources as a means of organising processes and obtaining a competitive advantage. Barney stated that for resources to hold potential as sources of sustainable competitive advantage, they should be valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and not substitutable (now generally known as ''VRIN'' criteria).&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view suggests that organisations must develop unique, firm-specific core competencies that will allow them to outperform competitors by doing things differently.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"/&gt;

Although the literature presents many different ideas around the concept of the resource-advantage perspective, at its heart, the common theme is that the firm's resources are financial, legal, human, organisational, informational and relational; resources are heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile and that management's key task is to understand and organise resources for sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, pp 387-401; Hunt, D. S. and Derozier, C., "The Normative Imperatives of Business and Marketing Strategy: Grounding Strategy in Resource-Advantage View," ''Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,'' Vol. 19, No. 1, 2004, pp. 5–22&lt;/ref&gt; Key theorists who have contributed to the development of a coherent body of literature include [[Jay Barney|Jay B. Barney]], [[George S. Day]], [[Gary Hamel]], [[Shelby D. Hunt]], G. Hooley and [[C.K. Prahalad]].

== Concept ==

Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage lies at the heart of much of the literature in both strategic management and strategic marketing.&lt;ref name="fahy1"&gt;Fahy, J and Smithee, A. "Strategic Marketing and the Resource Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science Review,'' Vol. 1999, 10, online at http://www.amsreview.org/articles/fahy10-1999.pdf or https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/025b/5aa7e682f4cbf1d7637a0bbe51a2a0d602e7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view offers strategists a means of evaluating potential factors that can be deployed to confer a competitive edge. A key insight arising from the resource-based view is that not all resources are of equal importance, nor possess the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The sustainability of any competitive advantage depends on the extent to which resources can be imitated or substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, R., "The Nature of Operations Strategy: Combining Strategic Decisions from an Operations and Market based Perspective," ''Management Decision,'' Vol. 41, No, 6, pp.  538–49&lt;/ref&gt; Barney and others point out that understanding the causal relationship between the sources of advantage and successful strategies can be very difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 108–09; Barney uses the term "causally ambiguous" which he describes as a situation when "the link between the resources controlled by the firm and the firm's sustained competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a great deal of managerial effort must be invested in identifying, understanding and classifying core competencies. In addition, management must invest in organisational learning to develop, nurture and maintain key resources and competencies.

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Wensley | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Assessing Advantage: A Framework for Diagnosing Competitive Superiority | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.2307/1251261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G. S. | year = 1994 | title = The Capabilities of Market-Driven Organizations | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 37–52 | doi=10.2307/1251915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooley | first1 = G. J. | last2 = Greenley | first2 = G. E. | last3 = Fahy | first3 = J. | last4 = Cadogan | first4 = J.

The key managerial tasks are:

1)   Identify the firm’s potential key resources.

2)   Evaluate whether these resources fulfill the following criteria (also known as ''VRIN'' criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad, C. K. and Hamel, G., "The Core Competence of the Corporation," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 79–91; Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt;

* Valuable - they enable a firm to implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness.
* Rare - not available to other competitors.
* Imperfectly imitable - not easily implemented by others.
* Non-substitutable - not able to be replaced by some other non-rare resource.

3) Develop, nurture and protect resources that pass these evaluations.

== Definitions ==

Given the centrality of resources in terms of conferring competitive advantage, the management and marketing literature carefully defines and classifies resources and capabilities.

=== Resources ===

Barney  defines firm resources as: "all [[assets]], capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. controlled by a firm that enable the firm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 101 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Capabilities===

Capabilities are “a special type of resource, specifically an organizationally embedded non-transferable firm-specific resource whose purpose is to improve the productivity of the other resources possessed by the firm.” &lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, No. 5, pp. 387–401 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive advantage===

Barney defined a [[competitive advantage]] as "when [a firm] is able to implement a “value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 102 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of resources and capabilities===

Firm-based resources may be tangible or intangible.

: ''Tangible resources'' include: physical assets such as financial resources and human resources including real estate, raw materials machinery, plant, inventory, brands, patents and trademarks and cash.&lt;ref&gt;Andriessen, D., ''Making Sense of Intellectual Capital: Designing a Method  for the Valuation of Intangibles,''  Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, Burlington, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Intangible resources'' may be embedded in organisational routines or practices such as an organization's reputation, culture, knowledge or know-how, accumulated experience, relationships with customers,  suppliers or other key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Lev, B., ''Intangibles:    Management,  Measurement, and Reporting,'' Brookings Institution Press, Washington,, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==RBV and strategy formulation==

Firms in possession of a resource, or mix of resources that are rare among competitors, are said to have a ''comparative advantage.'' This comparative advantage enables firms to produce marketing offerings that are either (a) perceived as having superior value or (b) can be produced at lower costs. Therefore, a comparative advantage in resources can lead to a competitive advantage in market position.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, S.D. and Morgan, R.M., "The Comparative Advantage of the Firm," ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 59, April, 1995, pp 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation. Hooley et al. suggest the following classification of competitive positions:&lt;ref&gt;Hooley, G., Broderick, A. and Moller, K., "Competitive Positioning and the Resource-Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of Strategic Marketing,'' Vol. 6, 1998, pp. 97–115&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Quality positioning
:* Innovation positioning
:* Service positioning
:* Benefit positioning
:* Tailored positioning (one-to-one marketing)

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of RBV have been widely cited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 41–56 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are as follows:

* The RBV is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collis | first1 = D. J. | year = | title = Research Note: How Valuable Are Organizational Capabilities? | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 1994 | issue = | pages = 143–152 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250150910}}; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Tautology in the Resource-Based View and Implications of Externally Determined Resource Value: Further Comments | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 57–66 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different resource configurations can generate the same value for firms and thus would not be competitive advantage {{cn|date=January 2018}}
* The role of product markets is underdeveloped in the argument &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based Theory a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 22–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory has limited prescriptive implications.&lt;ref name="priem1"/&gt;

Other criticisms include:

* The failure to consider factors surrounding resources; that is, an assumption that they simply exist, rather than a critical investigation of how key capabilities are acquired or developed.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe, A.L., "On Equilibrium, Organizational Form, and Competitive Strategy, in Joel A.C. Baum, Frank Dobbin (eds), ''Economics Meets Sociology in Strategic Management (Advances in Strategic Management),'' Volume 17, Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp 271 - 284&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is perhaps difficult (if not impossible) to find a resource which satisfies all of Barney's VRIN criteria.
* An assumption that a firm can be profitable in a highly competitive market as long as it can exploit advantageous resources does not always hold true. It ignores external factors concerning the industry as a whole; [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure Analysis]] ought also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelt, R. P., "How Much does Industry Matter?" ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 12, No. 3, 1991, pp. 167-185&lt;/ref&gt;

== UK Asset Resolution ==
In April 2009, Banks was recruited as Chief Executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley following its nationalisation six months earlier, when the retail savings and branch network had been sold to Santander UK and the mortgage book was closed to new business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bradford &amp; Bingley#Part nationalisation and sale to Santander]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock were merged in October 2010 he was made Chief Executive of the merged entity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ukar.co.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2010/14-12-2010?nextprev=1&amp;page=3|title = Establishment of UKAR|date = 1 October 2010|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = |publisher = UK Asset Resolution|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he gave an interview in which he said that he "didn't realise how bad Northern Rock was going to be".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He expected the government bail-out loan to be repaid by 2023, depending on interest rates, house prices and unemployment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both banks and customers shared the blame for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|credit crunch]], as they had both been over-optimistic. "House prices were going through the roof, everybody thought that was going to carry on and everybody assumed the economy was going to boom for ever", he said, blaming then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] for saying that boom and bust had been abolished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013 he was revealed as one of the top paid government employees, earning £815,000 – four times as much as the [[Prime Minister of Britain|Prime Minister]], having had a 27 percent pay rise that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/banking/article4108014.ece|title = Richard Banks, the man winding down B&amp;B and Northern Rock, paid £815,000|last = |first = |date = 4 June 2014|work = |accessdate = 2 September 2014|publisher = [[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2014, UK Asset Resolution under Banks had repaid £4bn to the British government out of its original £16bn loan, assets were down from £110bn to £66bn and mortgage arrears were down to 6 percent. This performance led the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' to ask if he was "Britain's best banker".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Banks was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61608|supp=y|page=B8|date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shell Crisis of 1915''' was a shortage of artillery shells on the front lines of [[World War I]] that led to a political crisis in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Military historian [[Hew Strachan]] argues that strategic plans caused an over-reliance on shrapnel to attack infantry in the open, which caused a shortage of high-explosive shells in most major armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hew |last=Strachan |title=The First World War |volume=Volume I: To Arms |date=2001 |pp=992–1105 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-1916-0834-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChpqA02Sa10C}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the war there was a revolution in doctrine: instead of the idea that artillery was a useful support for infantry attacks, the new doctrine held that heavy guns alone would control the battlefield. Because of the stable lines on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], it was easy to build rail lines that delivered all the shells the factories could produce. The "shell scandal" emerged in 1915 because the high rate of fire over a long period was not anticipated and the stock of shells became depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=French |title=The Military Background to the 'Shell Crisis' of May 1915 |work=Journal of Strategic Studies |date=September 1979 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pp=192–205 |doi=10.1080/01402397908437021 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402397908437021 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortage was widely publicized in the press. [[The Times|''The Times'']], in cooperation with [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Lord Northcliffe]], sought to force Parliament to adopt a national munitions policy with a strong leader at the head. The upshot was a coalition government with Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. In 1916 the long-term effects included the fall of the [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] government and his replacement by Lloyd George in December 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Fraser |title=The British 'Shells Scandal' of 1915 |work=Canadian Journal of History |date=April 1983 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pp=77–94 |url=http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/6659/5564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Times'' attacks Kitchener==
Lack of shells had been a serious problem since autumn 1914, and the British Commander-in-Chief [[Field Marshal]] Sir [[John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] gave an interview to ''The Times'' (27 March) calling for more ammunition. Lord Northcliffe, the owner of ''The Times'' and the ''Daily Mail'', blamed [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]], then [[Secretary of State for War]], for the recent death in action of his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |title=The Little Field Marshal: A Life of Sir John French |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |date=2004 |isbn=0-297-84614-0 |pp=289–290 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of an assurance from Kitchener, the Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], stated in a speech at Newcastle (20 April) that the army had sufficient ammunition.{{sfnp|Holmes|2004|p=287}}

After the [[Battle of Aubers Ridge#Analysis|failure]] of the [[Battle of Aubers Ridge]] on 9 May 1915, ''[[The Times]]'' war correspondent, Colonel [[Charles à Court Repington]], sent a telegram to his newspaper blaming lack of high-explosive shells. French had, despite Repington’s denial of his prior knowledge at the time, supplied him with information, and sent [[Brinsley FitzGerald|Brinsley Fitzgerald]] and Freddy Guest to London to show the same documents to Lloyd George and senior Conservatives [[Bonar Law]] and [[Arthur Balfour]].{{sfnp|Holmes|2004|p=287}}

''[[The Times]]'' headline on 14 May 1915, was: "Need for shells: British attacks checked: Limited supply the cause: A Lesson From France".{{sfnp|Holmes|2004|pp=287-289}} It commented "We had not sufficient high explosives to lower the enemy's parapets to the ground ... The want of an unlimited supply of high explosives was a fatal bar to our success", blaming the government for the battle's failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/shellscandal.htm |title=The Shell Scandal, 1915 |website=FirstWorldWar.com |date=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coalition Government==
The visit of the Opposition Leaders to [[H.H. Asquith]] (17 May) was caused  by [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher’s]] resignation (15 May) than by the Shells Scandal. As a result of the meeting Asquith wrote to his ministers demanding their resignations.{{sfnp|Holmes|2004|p=288}}

Asquith formed a new coalition government and appointed [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]].

Although [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians held office in subsequent coalitions, no purely Liberal government has held office in the UK since May 1915.

==''Daily Mail'' attacks Kitchener==
A more sensationalised version of the story was printed in the popular ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 21 May, blaming the Secretary of State for War [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], under the headline "The Shells Scandal: Lord Kitchener’s Tragic Blunder”. Lloyd George had to warn Northcliffe that the campaign was counterproductive and creating sympathy for Kitchener.{{sfnp|Holmes|2004|pp=288-289}}

Kitchener wanted to let the Shells Scandal drop. [[Stanley Brenton von Donop|Von Donop]], Master-General of the Ordnance, demanded an Inquiry to clear his name, but Kitchener persuaded him to withdraw the request as it would have led to French’s dismissal.{{sfnp|Holmes|2004|p=291}}

Although Lord Kitchener remained in office as Secretary of State for War, responsible for training and equipping the volunteer [[Kitchener's Army|New Armies]], he had lost control over munitions production and was increasingly sidelined from control of military strategy. Sir John French was also tarnished by his blatant meddling in politics, a factor which contributed to his enforced resignation in December 1915.

==Ministry of Munitions==

The [[Munitions of War Act 1915]] effectively ended the shell crisis and guaranteed a steady supply of munitions that the Germans were unable to match. The government  policy, according to [[J. A. R. Marriott]], was that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;no private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers' profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economize by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; Private factories must pass under the control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. A. R. Marriott]],  ''Modern England: 1885-1945'' (4th ed. 1948) p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Following the creation of the [[Ministry of Munitions]], new munitions factories began to be built across the country for the mass production of munitions. The construction of these factories took time and in order to ensure that there was no delay in the production of munitions to deal with the Shell Crisis, the Government turned to railway companies to manufacture materials of war.  Railway companies were well placed to manufacture munitions and other war materials, with their large locomotive and carriage works and skilled labourers, and by the end of 1915 the railway companies were producing between 1,000 and 5,000 6-inch. H.E. Shells per week.&lt;ref name="Pratt-Edwin A"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pratt |first=Edwin A |title=British Railways and the Great War Book |year=1921 |publisher=Selwyn and Blount |location=London |isbn=1-1518-5240-6 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092566128#page/n7/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the components for a number of different types of shell, the Railway companies - under the direction of the [[Railway Executive Committee]]'s Railway War Manufactures Sub-Committee - produced mountings for larger artillery, water-tank carts, miners’ trucks, heavy-capacity wagons, machinery for howitzer carriages, armoured trains and ambulances. In 1916, when the many factories being constructed by the [[Ministry of Munitions]] began producing large volumes of munitions, the work of the Railway Companies in producing war materials actually increased and they continued to produce high volumes of munitions throughout the war period. The official record, presented to the Government in May 1920, of the munitions work done throughout the war by the various railway companies ran to a total of 121 pages, giving some idea of the scale of what was undertaken by the Railway Companies across the country.  Indeed, many of these companies undertook this vital war work to the detriment of the maintenance of their own locomotives, carriages and wagons.&lt;ref name="Pratt-Edwin A"/&gt;

The [[Munitions of War Act 1915]] prevented the resignation of munitions workers without their employer's consent.  It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. Supplies and factories in [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries, particularly [[Canada]], were reorganised under the [[Imperial Munitions Board]], in order to supply adequate shells and other [[materiel]]s for the remainder of the war. The [[Health of Munitions Workers Committee]], one of the first investigations into [[occupational safety and health]], was set up in 1915 to improve productivity in factories.

There were at least three major explosions in such factories:

# An [[Faversham explosion|explosion at Faversham]] involving 200 tons of TNT killed 105 in 1916.
# The [[National Shell Filling Factory]], [[Chilwell]] exploded in 1918, killing 137.
# The [[Silvertown explosion]] occurred in [[Silvertown]] (now part of the London Borough of Newham, in Greater London) killing 73 and injuring 400 on Friday, 19 January 1917 at 6.52 pm.

'''SmartStax''' is a brand of [[Genetically modified plant|genetically modified]] seed made through a collaboration between [[Monsanto Company]] and [[Dow Chemical Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/corporatenews/2007/20070914a.htm |accessdate=September 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525030040/http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/corporatenews/2007/20070914a.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2009 |title=Monsanto, Dow Agreement Paves the Way for Industry's First-Ever, Eight-Gene Stacked Offering in Corn}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes advantage of multiple modes of insect protection and herbicide tolerance. SmartStax takes advantage of [[Yieldgard VT]] Triple (Monsanto), Herculex Xtra (Dow), RoundUp Ready 2 (Monsanto), and Liberty Link (Dow). The traits included protect against above-ground insects, below-ground insects, and provide broad herbicide tolerance.  It is currently available for [[maize|corn]], but [[cotton]], [[soybean]], and specialty crop variations are to be released. Previously, the most genes artificially added to a single plant was three, but Smartstax includes eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/smartstax-maize-germany-approval-428/|title=Monsanto’s SmartStax maize ‘to be approved for growth in October’ in EU|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smartstax also incorporates Monsanto's [[Acceleron Seed Treatment System]] which protects against insects at the earliest stages of development.  Smartstax is sold under the [[Genuity (Monsanto brand)|Genuity]] (Monsanto) and [[Mycogen Seeds|Mycogen]] (Dow) brands.

==Insect Spectrum==
SmartStax seeds control a broad spectrum of pests which includes larvae of above-ground insects such as European corn borer, black cutworm, southwestern corn borer, corn earworm, fall armyworm, western bean cutworm, and below-ground feeding larvae of western corn rootworm and northern corn rootworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowagro.com/en-us/usag/product-solution-finder/traits/smartstax|title=Dow AgroSciences SmartStax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge acres==
To prevent or delay insect resistance, growers plant a refuge on their farm. This is an area of non-GM plants where insect can live. These insect will not evolve resistance to GM technology. These refuge acres ensure that rare resistant insects that feed on insect-protected varieties of corn will mate with susceptible insects and slow the development of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cropwatch.unl.edu/corn-growers-reminded-follow-refuge-requirements-spring-planting-nears|title= Corn Growers Reminded to Follow Refuge Requirements as Spring Planting Nears|date=6 March 2009|author=Rob Korff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion and branding==
Smartstax corn has been advertised and promoted on television, at farm trade shows, and online as Monsanto has geared up for widespread commercial release. Smartstax is sold under the Genuity Brand by Monsanto and the Mycogen brand by Dow, but both companies have the right to sell it under as many names with as many additional technologies as they wish.

==Weed and insect resistance==
Recently, rapid emergence of weeds thought to be resistant to [[roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] have been observed. [[Conyza|Horseweed]], [[giant ragweed]] and [[amaranth|pigweed]], among others have been found growing with crops across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/invasion-of-the-superweeds/?ref=energy-environment | work =New York Times | title = Invasion of the Superweeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12804 | publisher = The National Academies | title = GE Crops Benefit Farmers, But Management Needed to Maintain Effectiveness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Farmers Cope With Roundup-Resistant Weeds | publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insects including [[western corn rootworm|corn rootworm]] and [[bollworm]] have also begun showing signs of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21829470 | year = 2011 | last1 = Gassmann | first1 = AJ | last2 = Petzold-Maxwell | first2 = JL | last3 = Keweshan | first3 = RS | last4 = Dunbar | first4 = MW | title = Field-evolved resistance to Bt maize by western corn rootworm | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e22629 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022629 | pmc = 3146474 | journal = PLOS ONE | editor1-last = Meyer | editor1-first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120605102846.htm | title = Bigger Refuges Needed to Delay Pest Resistance to Biotech Corn | publisher = Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207140803.htm| publisher = Science Daily | title = First Documented Case Of Pest Resistance To Biotech Cotton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/12/05/143141300/insects-find-crack-in-biotech-corns-armor | title = Insects Find Crack In Biotech Corn's Armor | publisher = NPR Food Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Monsanto has continued to develop new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101118084429.htm | publisher = Science Daily | title = New Disease-Resistant Food Crops Under Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/monsanto-gm-super-insects | title = Attack of the Monsanto Superinsects | publisher = Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USDA]] approves use of [[Bacillus thuringiensis#Use of Bt genes in genetic engineering of plants for pest control|Bt crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/biotechcrops/adoption.htm |title=Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S.: Extent of Adoption |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610043433/http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/biotechcrops/adoption.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto has denied there is a problem with their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/files/epa-hq-opp-2011-0922-0003.pdf| title = Memorandum | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Software Testing Outsourcing''' is software testing carried out by an independent company or a group of people not directly involved in the process of [[software development]].

Software testing is an essential phase of software development, however it is often viewed as a non-core activity for most organisations. Outsourcing enables an organisation to concentrate on its core development activities while external software testing experts handle the independent validation work. This offers many business benefits which include independent assessment leading to enhanced delivery confidence, reduced time to market, lower infrastructure investment, predictable software quality, de-risking of deadlines and increased time to focus on development.

'''Software Testing Outsourcing''' can come in different forms:

* Full [[outsourcing]], [[insourcing]] or remote insourcing of the entire test process (strategy, planning, execution and closure), often referred to as a Managed Testing Service or dedicated testing teams. 
* Provision of additional resources for major projects
* One-off test often related to load, stress or performance testing
* Beta User Acceptance Testing. Utilising specialist focus groups coordinated by an external organisation

==Top established global outsourcing cities==
According to Tholons Global Services - Top 50,&lt;ref name="Tholons_report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itida.gov.eg/Documents/Tholons_study.pdf |format=pdf |title=Top 50 Emerging Global Outsourcing Cities: A Global Services-Tholons Study |first1=Avinash |last1=Vashistha |first2=Imrana |last2=Khan |date=October 2009|access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009, Top Established and Emerging Global Outsourcing Cities in Testing function were:
# [[Bengaluru, India]]
# [[Cebu City, Philippines]]
# [[Shanghai, China]]
# [[Beijing, China]]
# [[Kraków, Poland]]
# [[Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]]

==Vietnam outsourcing==
Vietnam has become a major player in software outsourcing. Ho Chi Minh City's ability to meet clients’ needs in scale and capacity, its maturing business environment, the country’s stability in political and labor conditions, its increasing number of English speakers and its high service-level maturity make it attractive to foreign interests.&lt;ref name="PC_World_Viet_Nam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logigear.com/blog/about-logigear/software-outsourcing-recovery-and-development/ |date=January 20, 2011 |publisher=LogiGear Corporation |title=Software outsourcing: Recovery and development |access-date=December 13, 2017 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam's software industry has maintained annual growth rate of 30-50% during the past 10 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} From 2002 to 2013 revenue of the software industry increased to nearly 3 US$ billion and the hardware industry increased to 36.8 US$ billion.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Many Vietnamese enterprises have been granted international certificates (CMM) for their software development.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2014/12/09/vietnam-it-services-climb-the-value-chain/ |title=Vietnam IT Services Climb the Value Chain |first=Will |last=Greene |date=December 9, 2014 |access-date=December 13, 2017 |publisher=Forbes Media LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Global Services Location Index 2017 by [[A.T. Kearney]], Vietnam ranks sixth in global software outsourcing market. Vietnam’s position in this year’s index reflects its growing popularity for [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO). Its BPO industry earned US$2 billion in 2015 and has annually grown by 20-25% in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atkearney.com/digital-transformation/gsli/full-report|title=Read @ATKearney: The Widening Impact of Automation|website=www.atkearney.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argentina outsourcing==
Argentina’s software industry has experienced an exponential growth in the last decade, positioning itself as one of the strategic economic activities in the country. As Argentina is just one hour ahead of North America's east coast, communication takes place in real time. Argentina’s Internet culture and industry is one of the best, Facebook penetration in Argentina ranks 3rd worldwide and the country has the highest penetration of smart phones in Latin America (24%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Argentina |publisher=New Media Trend Watch |url=http://www.newmediatrendwatch.com/markets-by-country/11-long-haul/35-argentina |date=December 17, 2008 |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221020443/https://www.newmediatrendwatch.com/markets-by-country/11-long-haul/35-argentina/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the most surprising facts is that the percentage that internet contributes to Argentina’s Gross National Product (2.2%) ranks 10th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Internet aportará u$s24.700 millones al PBI de la Argentina en 2016 |date=May 3, 2012 |language=Spanish |url=https://www.infobae.com/2012/05/03/645695-internet-aportara-us24700-millones-al-pbi-la-argentina-2016/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505141837/http://www.infobae.com/notas/645695-Internet-aportara-us24700-millones-al-PBI-de-la-Argentina-en-2016.html |archive-date=May 5, 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Umeda'''|梅田|lead=yes}} is a major commercial and business district in [[Kita-ku, Osaka|Kita-ku]], [[Osaka]], [[Japan]], and the city's main northern railway terminus ([[Ōsaka Station]], [[Umeda Station]]).

The area is notable for its comparatively high concentration of tall buildings, of which those in Nishi-Umeda, [[Dojima]] and [[Nakanoshima]] form a prominent [[skyscraper]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=860|title=Osaka - SkyscraperPage.com|website=skyscraperpage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the city's largest department stores ([[Hanshin Department Store|Hanshin]], [[Hankyu]], [[Daimaru]], and [[Isetan]]) are located here, as well as popular shopping and tourist areas such as [[HEP Five]], Osaka Grand Front, and [[Umeda Sky Building]].

The district's name means "plum field". 

In addition to  being a major business district, Umeda offers a large selection of shopping, entertainment, and nightlife venues.

'''Unemployment benefits''' (depending on the jurisdiction also called '''unemployment insurance''' or '''unemployment compensation''') are payments made by back authorized bodies to [[unemployment|unemployed]] people. In the United States, benefits are funded by a compulsory governmental insurance system, not taxes on individual citizens. Depending on the jurisdiction and the status of the person, those sums may be small, covering only basic needs, or may compensate the lost time proportionally to the previous earned salary.

Unemployment benefits are generally given only to those registering as unemployed, and often on conditions ensuring that they seek work and do not currently have a job, and are validated as being laid off and not fired for cause in most states.

==History==
[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leaflet promoting the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].]]
The first unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] government of [[H. H. Asquith]]. The popular measures were to combat the increasing influence of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] among the country's working-class population. The Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. It only applied to wage earners, however, and their families and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support, if any.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/national-health-insurance.htm The Cabinet Papers 1915-1982: National Health Insurance Act 1911.] The National Archives, 2013. Retrieved 30 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures in the implementation of the Act included [[Robert Laurie Morant]], and William Braithwaite.

By the time of its implementation, the benefit was criticized by communists, who thought such insurance would prevent workers from starting a revolution, while employers and [[Tory|tories]] saw it as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref name="bogardus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogardus|first1=Emory S.|authorlink1=Emory S. Bogardus|title=Sociology|date=1950|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|The Macmillan Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|page=424|edition=3rd|chapter=Group Disorganization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was based on [[actuary|actuarial]] principles and it was funded by a fixed amount each from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It was restricted to particular industries, particularly more volatile ones like shipbuilding, and did not make provision for any dependants. After one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible for receiving 7 shillings/week for up to 15 weeks in a year. By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit.

===Expansion and spread===
The [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] created the dole system of payments for unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. R. Garside|title=British Unemployment 1919-1939: A Study in Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIp3oq398IC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=37|isbn=9780521892544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dole system provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11 million workers—practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, railroad men, and civil servants.

Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the [[Second World War]] with the expansion of the [[welfare state]]. Unemployment insurance in the United States originated in [[Wisconsin]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 213"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935, the [[federal government of the United States]] effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.

==Argentina==
In [[Argentina]], successive administrations have used a variety of passive and active labour market interventions to protect workers against the consequences of economic shocks. The government's key institutional response to combat the increase in [[poverty]] and unemployment created by the crisis{{clarify|which crisis? when?|date=November 2017}} was the launch of an active unemployment assistance programme called Plan Jefas y Jefes de Hogar Desocupados (Program for Unemployed Heads of Households).

==Australia==
{{Main article|Social Security (Australia)}}
In [[Australia]], social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund. Rather, benefits are funded in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, [[Centrelink]]. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.

There are two types of payment available to those experiencing unemployment. The first, called Youth Allowance, is paid to young people aged 16–20 (or 15, if deemed to meet the criteria for being considered 'independent' by Centrelink). Youth Allowance is also paid to full-time students aged 16–24, and to full-time Australian Apprenticeship workers aged 16–24. People aged below 18 who have not completed their High School education, are usually required to be in full-time education, undertaking an apprenticeship or doing training to be eligible for Youth Allowance. For single people under 18 years of age living with a parent or parents the basic rate is [[Australian dollar|A$]]91.60 per week. For over-18- to 20-year-olds living at home this increases to A$110.15 per week. For those aged 18–20 not living at home the rate is A$167.35 per week. There are special rates for those with partners and/or children.

The second kind of payment is called Newstart Allowance and is paid to unemployed people over the age of 21 and under the pension eligibility age. To receive a Newstart payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home). The rate of Newstart allowance as at 12 January 2010 for single people without children is A$228 per week, paid fortnightly. (This does not include supplemental payments such as Rent Assistance.) Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children.

Effectively, people have had to survive on $39 a day from Newstart since 1994, and there have been calls to raise this by politicians and NGO groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/09/14/31/john-howard-joins-calls-for-newstart-boost&lt;/ref&gt;

The system in Australia is designed to support recipients no matter how long they have been unemployed. In recent years the former [[Australian Liberal Party|Coalition]] government under [[John Howard]] has increased the requirements of the Activity Agreement, providing for controversial schemes such as [[Work for the Dole]], which requires that people on benefits for 6 months or longer work voluntarily for a community organisation regardless of whether such work increases their skills or job prospects. Since the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government under [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected in 2008, the length of unemployment before one is required to fulfill the requirements of the Activity Agreement (which has been renamed the Employment Pathway Plan) has increased from six to twelve months. There are other options available as alternatives to the Work for the Dole scheme, such as undertaking part-time work or study and training, the basic premise of the Employment Pathway Plan being to keep the welfare recipient active and involved in seeking full-time work.

For people renting their accommodation, unemployment benefits are supplemented by Rent Assistance, which, for single people as at 29 June 2012, begins to be paid when weekly rent is more than A$53.40. Rent Assistance is paid as a proportion of total rent paid (75 cents per dollar paid over $53.40 up to the maximum). The maximum amount of rent assistance payable is A$60.10 per week, and is paid when the total weekly rent exceeds A$133.54 per week. Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children, or who are sharing accommodation.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the system now known as Employment Insurance was formerly called [[Unemployment Insurance]]. The name was changed in 1996, in order to alleviate perceived negative connotations. In 2015, Canadian workers pay premiums of 1.62%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/clcltng/ei/cnt-chrt-pf-eng.html|title=EI premium rates and maximums|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.

The [[Employment and Social Insurance Act]] was passed in 1935 during the [[Great Depression]] by the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance programme. It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to "Unemployment Insurance" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940. Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system. It was extended dramatically by [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1971 making it much easier to get. The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.

The generosity of the Canadian UI programme was progressively reduced after the adoption of the 1971 UI Act. At the same time, the federal government gradually reduced its financial contribution, eliminating it entirely by 1990. The EI system was again cut by the Progressive Conservatives in 1990 and 1993, then by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in 1994 and 1996. Amendments made it harder to qualify by increasing the time needed to be worked, although seasonal claimants (who work long hours over short periods) turned out to gain from the replacement, in 1996, of weeks by hours to qualify. The ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed, after having stood at around 40 percent for many years, rose somewhat during the 2009 recession but then fell back again to the low 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/ei/reports/mar2012/index.shtml |title= 2012 EI Monitoring and Assessment Report (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, March 2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job. The length of time one could take EI has also been cut repeatedly. The 1994 and 1996 changes contributed to a sharp fall in Liberal support in the Atlantic provinces in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 election]].

In 2001, the federal government increased parental leave from 10 to 35 weeks, which was added to preexisting maternity benefits of 15 weeks. In 2004, it allowed workers to take EI for compassionate care leave while caring for a dying relative, although the strict conditions imposed make this a little used benefit. In 2006, the Province of Quebec opted out of the federal EI scheme in respect of maternity, parental and adoption benefits, in order to provide more generous benefits for all workers in that province, including self-employed workers. Total EI spending was $19.677 billion for 2011-2012 (figures in [[Canadian dollar]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2012/index-eng.html |title= Public Accounts of Canada for 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area. The EI system is managed by [[Service Canada]], a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of [[Employment and Social Development Canada]].

A bit over half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces but EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, which have higher rates of unemployment. Many Atlantic workers are also employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry or tourism and go on EI over the winter when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect EI. EI also pays for [[Parental leave|maternity and parental leave]], [[compassionate care leave]], and illness coverage. The programme also pays for retraining programmes (EI Part II) through labour market agreements with the Canadian provinces.

A significant part of the federal fiscal surplus of the [[Jean Chrétien]] and [[Paul Martin]] years came from the EI system. Premiums were reduced much less than falling expenditures - producing, from 1994 onwards, EI surpluses of several billion dollars per year, which were added to general government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 14(Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulative EI surplus stood at $57 billion at 31 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/49-eng.pdf |title= Public Accounts of Canada, 2008, page 4.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly four times the amount needed to cover the extra costs paid during a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 8 (Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew criticism from Opposition parties and from business and labour groups, and has remained a recurring issue of the public debate. The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/committee/381/huma/reports/rp1624652/humarp03/humarp03-e.pdf |title= Restoring Financial Governance and Accessibility n the Employment Insurance Program - Report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, page 59: Dissenting Opinion, Conservative Party of Canada - Peter Van Loan, M.P., York-Simcoe - CPC HRSDC Critic - February 09, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose not to recognize those EI surpluses after [[Canadian federal election, 2006|being elected in 2006]]. Instead, the Conservative government cancelled the EI surpluses entirely in 2010, and required EI contributors to make up the 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual deficits by increasing EI premiums. On 11 December 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rejected a court challenge launched against the federal government by two Quebec unions, who argued that EI funds had been misappropriated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc68/2008scc68.html |title= Text of judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada on Employment Insurance surpluses - Confédération des syndicats nationaux v.

==European Union==
{{See also|European unemployment insurance}}
Each Member State of the European Union has its own system and in general a worker should claim unemployment benefits in the country where they last worked. For a person working in a country other than their country of residency (a cross-border worker), they will have to claim benefits in their country of residence.&lt;ref name="europa"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/unemployment-and-benefits/social-security/index_en.htm |title= Social security systems in the EU |website=Europa |date= 21 Mar 2018 |accessdate= 5 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
Two systems run in parallel, combining a [[Ghent system]] and a minimum level of support provided by [[Kela (Finnish)|Kela]], an agency of the national government. Unionization rates are high (70%), and union membership comes with membership in an unemployment fund. Additionally, there are non-union unemployment funds. Usually benefits require 26 weeks of 18 hours per week on average, and the unemployment benefit is 60% of the salary and lasts for 500 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preconditions of earnings-related daily allowancet|url=http://en.ytk.fi/benefits-abc/preconditions-of-earnings-related-daily-allowance/other-preconditions|publisher=YTK|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is not available, Kela can pay either regular unemployment benefit or labor market subsidy benefits. The former requires a degree and two years of full-time work. The latter requires participation in training, education, or other employment support, which may be mandated on pain of losing the benefit, but may be paid after the regular benefits have been either maxed out or not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unemployment|url=http://www.kela.fi/in/internet/english.nsf/NET/081101150015EH?OpenDocument|publisher=KELA|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the unemployment funds handle the payments, most of the funding is from taxes and compulsory tax-like unemployment insurance charges.

Regardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the ''Työ- ja elinkeinokeskus'' (''TE-keskus'', or the "Work and Livelihood Centre"), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers. In order to be considered unemployed, the seeker must register at the TE-keskus as unemployed. If the jobseeker does not have degree, the agency can require the jobseeker to apply to a school.

If the individual does not qualify for any unemployment benefit he may still be eligible for the housing benefit (''asumistuki'') from Kela and municipal social welfare provisions (''toimeentulotuki''). They are not unemployment benefits and depend on household income, but they have in practice become the basic income of many long-term unemployed.

==France==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in France}}
[[France]] uses a quasi [[Ghent system]], under which unemployment benefits are distributed by an independent agency (UNEDIC) in which [[trade union|unions]] and Employer organisations are equally represented. UNEDIC is responsible for 3 benefits: ARE, ACA and ASR The main ARE scheme requires a minimum of 122 days membership in the preceding 24 months and certain other requirements before any claims can be made. Employers pay a contribution on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with the employee contribution, fund the scheme.

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of [[EUR]] 162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or 6900 euros per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://www.pole-emploi.fr/candidat/le-montant-de-votre-allocation-@/suarticle.jspz?id=4125&lt;/ref&gt; Claimants receive 57,4% of their average daily salary of the last 12 months preceding unemployment with the average amount being 1,111 euros per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://entreprise.lefigaro.fr/chomeurs-unedic.html&lt;/ref&gt; In France tax and other payroll taxes are paid on unemployment benefits. In 2011 claimants received the allowance for an average 291 days.

==Germany==
[[Germany]] has two different types of unemployment benefits.

=== Unemployment benefit I ===

The ''unemployment benefit I'' in [[Germany]] is also known as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer.

All workers with a regular employment contract (''abhängig Beschäftigte''), except freelancers and certain civil servants (''Beamte''), contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.

The system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR).

The system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Jobcenters.

Unemployed workers are entitled to:
* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit
* Help in finding work
* Training

Unemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job. The allowance is paid for half of the period that the worker has contributed. Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children. The maximum benefit is therefore 2964 Euros (in 2012).
In 2011 the federal Work Agency had revenues and expenses of 37.5 bn EUR&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531155700/http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a change in German law effective since 2008, provided their job history qualifies them, benefit recipients aged 50 to 54 now receive an unemployment benefit for 15 months, those 55 to 57 for 18 months and those 58 or older receive benefits for 24 months. For those under the age of 50 who have not been employed for more than 30 months in a job which paid into the social security scheme, full unemployment benefit can be received for a maximum period of 12 months. Note how the duration of eligibility is variegated in Germany to account for the difficulty older people have re-entering the job market.

=== Unemployment benefit II ===
{{Main article|Hartz concept}}
If a worker is not eligible for the full unemployment benefits or after receiving the full unemployment benefit for the maximum of 12 months, he is able to apply for benefits from the so-called Arbeitslosengeld II (Hartz IV) programme, an open-ended welfare programme which ensures people do not fall into penury. A person receiving Hartz IV benefits is paid 404 EUR &lt;small&gt;(2016)&lt;/small&gt; a month for living expenses plus the cost of adequate housing (including heating) and health care. Couples can receive benefits for each partner including their children. Additionally, children can get "benefits for education and participation". Germany does not have an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card system in place and, instead, disburses welfare in cash or via direct deposit onto the recipient's bank account. People who receive Hartz 4 are obligated to seek for jobs and can be forced to take part in social programs or [[Mini jobs]] in order to receive this Hartz 4 money. Most of these programs and Mini jobs oblige the employee to work the same hours as a normal full-time job each day, 5 days a week. 

==Greece==
Unemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED ({{Lang-el|Οργανισμός Απασχόλησης Εργατικού Δυναμικού}}, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years. The self-employed do not qualify, and neither do those with other sources of income. The monthly benefit is fixed at the "55% of 25 minimum daily wages", and is currently 360 [[euro]]s per month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-19289566 |title=Greeks go back to basics as recession bites |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OAEDbenefits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oaed.gr/en/2012-02-07-18-31-19/2012-02-07-18-31-52/2012-07-03-09-22-05 |publisher=ΟΑΕΔ |title=OAED Unemployment Benefits (in Greek)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 10% increase for each under-age child. Recipients are eligible for at most twelve months; the exact duration depends on the collected number of ensema ''ένσημα'', that is social security payment coupons-stamps collected (i.e. days of work) during the 14 months before being laid off; the minimum number of such coupons, under which there is no eligibility, is 125, collected in the first 12 of the 14 aforementioned months. Eligibility since 1 January 2013, has been further constrained in that one applying for unemployment benefits for a second or more time, must not have received more than the equivalent of 450 days of such benefits during the last four years since the last time one had started receiving such benefits; if one has received unemployment benefits in this period for more than 450 days then there is no eligibility while if one has received less, then one is only eligible for at most the remaining days up until the maximum of 450 days is reached.&lt;ref name=OAEDbenefits /&gt;

In terms of an unemployment allowance, Greece allows for those found in unemployment, who are employed through an independent profession, to receive benefits if their latest paycheck had not exceed a certain amount, the current rate should not exceed € 1,467.35. When receiving benefits an individual cannot be earning money from a self-employed profession. If the income increases the fixed amount, a tax authority must issue a certificate that explains that the individual has "interrupted the exercise of the profession", which must be done within 15 days.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaed.gr/sychnes-eroteseis-epidomata-paroches|title=Συχνές Ερωτήσεις Επιδόματα Παροχές|website=Οργαισμοσ Απαχολησησ Εργατικου Δυναμικου|language=el-GR|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment benefits are also granted to those who have generated an income that does not exceed €1,467.35 from the final paycheck received from a liberal profession. In order to receive a grant the individual must not be receiving an income from the previous liberal profession. Under the [[European Commission]], liberal professions are professions that require specialized training and that are regulated by "national governments or professional bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/promoting-entrepreneurship/we-work-for/liberal-professions_en|title=Liberal professions - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal aid is also provided to workers whose jobs cannot be performed through the entire year are also provided benefits by the OAED. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1112&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=4571|title=Greece - Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the OAED, individuals who are benefiting from long-term unemployment must be within the ages of 20 to 66 years of age and have a family income that does not exceed € 10,000 annually.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; An individual becomes eligible for long-term benefits if the regular unemployment subsidy is exhausted after 12 months. After the expiration of the 12-month period an application towards long-term unemployment benefits must be submitted in the first 2 months. If an unemployed person seeks long term unemployment and has a child, the allowance is allowed to increase by € 586.08 (per child). Long-term unemployment can only be granted if the individual can be found registered under the OAED unemployment registrar.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

== Iceland ==
To receive [[unemployment]] benefits in [[Iceland]], one must submit an application to the Directorate of Labour (''Vinnumálastofnun'') and meet a specific criteria set forth by the department.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcc.is/english/work/unemployment-benefits/|title=Unemployment Benefits {{!}} Fjölmenningarsetur|website=www.mcc.is|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelandic [[Employment rate|employment rates]] have traditionally been higher than every other [[OECD]] country. In the most recent financial quarter, 85.8 percent of the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] working-age population were employed, with only 2.8 percent of the population unemployed.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm|title=Employment - Employment rate - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down by age group, [[Iceland|Iceland's]] labor force is highly active, with 74.9 percent of the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years old and 89.4 percent of people between the ages of 25 to 55 years old active in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This low rate of [[unemployment]] is attributed to the adoption of the [[Ghent system]], which has been adopted by the countries of [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], and highly emphasizes [[Trade union|trade and labor unions]] to provide unemployment benefits and protections to workers, which ultimately has led to higher union membership than other [[Capitalist economics|capitalist economies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scruggs|first=Lyle|date=1 June 2002|title=The Ghent System and Union Membership in Europe, 1970-1996|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/106591290205500201|journal=Political Research Quarterly, University of Connecticut|volume=|pages=275-297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety net that these unions provide also leads to more stable job retention and less reliance on [[Part-time contract|part-time]] employment. Only 11.9 percent of the working population is dependent on [[Temporary work|temporary employment]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Unlike purely [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] states in [[Europe]], the [[Nordic model]] that [[Iceland]] adopted borrows aspects of both a [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[Economic liberalism|liberal]]-[[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalisms Compared|last=Bowman|first=John R.|publisher=CQPress|year=1952|isbn=|location=|pages=12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceland]] not only sees high government involvement in providing [[Welfare|social welfare]] and amenities as with the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] model, but like the [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Welfare state|welfare]] model, it is also heavily reliant on [[free trade]] and markets.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The country relies on an open [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] market for economic growth, yet also embraces a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system that allows for wage bargaining to occur between the labor force and employers in order to protect workers and ensure provisions like [[unemployment]] benefits are ensured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/5726|title=The Nordic Model|last=Andersen, Holmström, Honkapohja, Korkman, Söderström, Vartiainen|first=|date=2007|website=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[legislation]] that ensures these benefits is The Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which was adopted in 1938 and has been amended five times since its inception to adjust to the rise of [[globalization]]. In Section 1, Articles 1-13 grant [[Trade union|trade unions]] the right to organize and negotiate with employers over fair wages for its members as well as representation for their members in the event of workplace conflicts.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asi.is/media/249303/l-80_1938.pdf|title=Act of Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights for organized [[Trade union|unions]] set forth by the [[Ministry of Welfare (Iceland)|Ministry of Welfare]] not only provide the country's labor force fair and equal representation within their respective industries, but also allow for these organizations to maintain an active relationship with the [[Politics of Iceland|Icelandic government]] to discuss economic issues, promote labor and social equality, and ensure benefits for unemployed laborers, as these [[Trade union|unions]] are highly centralized and not [[Political affiliation|politically affiliated]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment benefits in [[Iceland]] (''atvinnuleysisbætur'') can involve up to 100 percent reimbursement per month for wage earners for a maximum of 30 months.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.a-kasser.dk/unemployment-insurance-in-europe/iceland/|title=Unemployment benefits in Iceland|website=www.a-kasser.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these rates of reimbursement are determined by previous status of employment, such as whether an individual is a [[Wage earner|wage-earner]] or is [[Self-employment|self-employed]], as well as meeting certain mandates such as being a current resident of [[Iceland]], be actively searching for employment, and retaining a 25 percent position for three months within the past 12 months before filing for [[unemployment]]. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Unemployed workers can be compensated through either basic or income-linked benefits. Basic unemployment benefits can cover both wage-earning and self-employing individuals for the first half-month (10 days) after they lose their job, whereas income-linked benefits can cover wage-earning and self-employing individuals for up to three months based on a set salary index and length of employment.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; However, those who are unemployed must report to the Directorate of Labour once a month to reaffirm their status of unemployment and that they are actively searching for employment or unemployment benefits could be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vinnumalastofnun.is/en/unemployment-benefits/rights-and-obligations|title=Rights and obligations|website=www.vinnumalastofnun.is|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Icelandic Labour Law, employees must be given a notice period of termination that can range from 12 days to six months and is determined by the length of previous employment under the same employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asi.is/media/7250/Icelandic_labour_law_-6_utg_.pdf|title=Icelandic Labour Law|last=Norðdahl|first=Magnús M.|date=1 May 2013|website=|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== Ireland ==
People aged 18 and over and who are unemployed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] can apply for either the Jobseeker's Allowance (''Liúntas do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta'') or the Jobseeker's Benefit (''Sochar do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta''). Both are paid by the [[Department of Social Protection]] and are nicknamed "the dole".

Unemployment benefit in Ireland can be claimed indefinitely for as long as the individual remains unemployed. The standard payment is €193 per week for those aged 26 and over. For those aged 18 to 24 the rate is €100 per week. For those aged 25 the weekly rate is €144. Payments can be increased if the unemployed has dependents. For each adult dependent, another €124.80 is added, €100 if the recipient (as opposed to the dependent) is aged 18 to 24, and for each child dependent €29.80 is added.

There are more benefits available to unemployed people, usually on a special or specific basis. Benefits include the ''Rent Supplement'', the ''Mortgage Interest Supplement'' and the ''Fuel Allowance'', among others. People on a low income (which includes those on JA/JB) are entitled to a Medical Card (although this must be applied for separately from the [[Health Service Executive]]) which provides free health care, optical care, limited dental care, aural care and subsidised prescription drugs carrying a €2.50 per item charge to a maximum monthly contribution of €25 per household (as opposed to subsidised services like non medical-card holders).

To qualify for Jobseekers Allowance, claimants must satisfy the "Habitual Residence Condition": they must have been legally in the state (or the [[Common Travel Area]]) for two years or have another good reason (such as lived abroad and are returning to Ireland after become unemployed or deported). This condition does not apply to Jobseekers Benefit (which is based on Social Insurance payments).

==Israel==
{{See also|Welfare in Israel}}
In [[Israel]], unemployment benefits are paid by [[Bituah Leumi]] (the National Insurance Institute), to which workers must pay contributions. Eligible workers must immediately register with the Employment Service Bureau upon losing their jobs or jeopordize their eligibility, and the unemployment period is considered to start upon registration with the Employment Service Bureau. To be eligible for unemployment benefits, an employee must have completed a "qualifying period" of work for which unemployment insurance contributions were paid, which varies between 300 and 360 days. Employees who were involuntarily terminated from their jobs or who terminated their own employment and can provide evidence of having done so for a justified reason are eligible for immediately receiving unemployment benefits, while those who are deemed to have terminated their employment of their own volition with no justified reason will only begin receiving unemployment benefits 90 days from the start of their unemployment period.&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/periodofentitlement/Pages/numberofdays.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il1"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/Pages/Conditionsofeligibility.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il2"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/Amount/Pages/Benefitrates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unemployment benefits are paid daily, with the amount calculated based on the employee's previous income over the past six months, but not exceeding the daily average wage for the first 125 days of payment and two-thirds of the daily average wage from the 126th day onwards. During the unemployment period, the Employment Service Bureau assists in helping locate suitable work and job training, and regularly reporting to the Employment Service Bureau is a condition for continuing to receive unemployment benefits. A person who was offered suitable work or training by the Employment Service Bureau but refused will only receive unemployment benefits 90 days after the date of the refusal, and 30 days' worth of unemployment benefits will be deducted for each subsequent refusal.&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il2"/&gt;

Members of [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im are typically not covered by the national unemployment system and are covered by the community's own social welfare system, unless they are employed outside of their community or directly by the community.

==Italy==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Italy}}
Unemployment benefits in [[Italy]] consists mainly in cash transfers based on [[contributions]] (''Assicurazione Sociale per l'Impiego, ASPI''), up to the 75 percent of the previous wages for up to sixteen months. Other measures are:
* Redundancy Fund (''Cassa integrazione guadagni'', or CIG): cash benefits provided as [[shock absorbers]] to those workers who are suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories, aiming to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce
* Solidarity Contracts (''Contratti di solidarietà''): in the same cases granting CIG benefits, companies can sign contracts with reduced work time, to avoid dismissing redundancy workers. The state will grant to those workers the 60 percent of the lost part of the wage.
* Mobility allowances (''Indennità di mobilità''),: if the Redundancy Fund does not allow the company to re-establish a good financial situation, the workers can be entitled to mobility allowances. Other companies are provided [[incentive]]s for employing them. This measure has been abolished in 2012 and will stop working in 2017.
In the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are [[income]]-related, and they have an average [[decommodification]] level. The basis for entitlement is always [[employment]], with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state. An interesting feature worthy to be discussed is that the Italian system takes in consideration also the economic situation of the employers, and aims as well at relieving them from the costs of crisis.

==Japan==
{{Main article|Unemployment insurance (Japan)}}
Unemployment benefits in Japan are called "unemployment insurance" and are closer to the US or Canadian "user pays" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as Britain, New Zealand, or Australia. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Employment Service Centre for Foreigners website [http://www.tfemploy.go.jp/en/spec/spec_1d.html For foreign nationals working in Japan] Retrieved on 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a "Rishoku-hyo" document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately. These items affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/Japan/Japan-Guide/Jobs/Employment-insurance|title=Employment insurance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.&lt;ref&gt;Nagoya International Center [http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/2010/09/09/unemployment-insurance-3/ Insurance] Retrieved on 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It is supposed to be compulsory for most full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jil.go.jp/english/laborinfo/library/documents/llj_law11.pdf|title=Employment Insurance Law (Japan)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they have been enrolled for at least 6 months and are fired or made redundant, leave the company at the end of their contract, or their contract is non-renewed, the now-unemployed worker will receive unemployment insurance. If a worker quit of their own accord they may have to wait between 1 and 3 months before receiving any payment.

==Mexico==
[[Mexico]] lacks a national unemployment insurance system, but it does have five programs to assist the unemployed: 

* Mexico City Unemployment Benefit Scheme - The only unemployment insurance system based on worker contributions exists in [[Mexico City]]. Unemployed residents of Mexico City who are at least 18 years of age, have worked for at least six months, have no income, and are actively seeking work are eligible for unemployment benefits for up to six months, which are composed of payments of 30 days' worth of minimum wage per month.&lt;ref name=careeraddict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careeraddict.com/claim-unemployment-benefits-in-mexico|title=How to Claim Unemployment Benefits in Mexico|first=Amy|last=Theodore|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) - This institution insures workers in the formal sector, providing pensions and health insurance. Workers insured by the IMSS who are unemployed may withdraw a maximum of 30 days' worth of pension savings every five years.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt; However, this does not cover the majority of workers, as 58% of the labor force is in the informal sector.

* National Employment Service - This agency, which has 165 offices nationwide, offers financial support in learning new skills to those aged 16 and above who are unemployed or underemployed, and assistance in finding new jobs in the form of information on vacancies and job fairs.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

* Temporary Employment Program - This scheme is designed to aid unemployed people who live in rural areas with high unemployment rates, any area undergoing a financial crisis, or an area that has been hit by a natural disaster or some other kind of emergency. The program funds projects to boost employment by hiring local workers aged 16 and above in jobs such as building infrastructure and promoting development, and conserving the environment and cultural heritage sites. They are paid a salary at 99% of the local minimum wage for a maximum of 132 days a year.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

* Income Generating Options Program - People living in poverty in an area of up to a maximum of 15,000 inhabitants are eligible for funding for projects to generate income for themselves.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

==Netherlands==
Unemployment benefits in the Netherlands were introduced in 1949. Separate schemes exist for mainland Netherlands and for the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].

The scheme in mainland Netherlands entails that, according to the Werkloosheidswet (Unemployment Law, WW), employers are responsible for paying the contributions to the scheme, which are deducted from the salary received by the employees. In 2012 the contribution was 4.55% of gross salary up to a ceiling of 4,172 euros per month. The first 1,435.75 euros of an employees gross salaries are not subject to the 4.55% contribution.

Benefits are paid for a maximum period of 38 months and claimants get 75% of last salary for 2 months and 70% thereafter with a maximum benefit of 3128 euros, depending on how long the claimant has been employed previously. Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).

==New Zealand==
{{Main article|Social welfare in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as "the dole" provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work. It is one of a number of benefits administered by [[Work and Income]], a service of the Ministry of Social Development.

To get this benefit, a person must meet the conditions and obligations specified in section 88A to 123D Social Security Act 1964. These conditions and obligations cover things such as age, residency status, and availability to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/income_support/main_benefits/unemployment_benefit/unemployment_benefit.htm Unemployment Benefit] Manuals and Procedures - Work and Income website&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount that is paid depends on things such as the person's age, income, marital status and whether they have children. It is adjusted annually on 1 April and in response to changes in legislature. Some examples of the maximum after tax weekly rate at 1 April 2011 are:
* $175.10 for a single person aged 20–24 years without children
* $210.13 for a single person 25 years or over
* $325.98 for a sole parent
* $350.20 for a married, de facto or civil union couple with or without children ($167.83 each).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/benefit-rates-april-2011.html|title=Work and Income Unemployment Benefit Rates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Spain}}
The Spanish unemployment benefits system is part of the [[Social Security in Spain|Social security system of Spain]]. Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE).The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits.

Contributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months contributions over a period of 6 years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after 6 months. The minimum benefit is 497 euros per month and the maximum is 1087,20 euros per month for a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayudasparados.com/importe-maximo-desempleo-2012/105|title=importe maximo desempleo 2018 - Ayudas a Parados|website=www.ayudasparados.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.

==Sweden==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Sweden}}
[[Sweden]] uses the [[Ghent system]], under which a significant proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by [[trade union|union]] unemployment funds. Unemployment benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see [[Unemployment funds in Sweden]]).

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of July 2016) [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 980 per day. During the first 200 days the unemployed will receive 80 percent of his or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201-300 this goes down to 70 percent and from day 301-450 the insurance covers 65 percent of the normal income (only available for parents to children under the age of 18). In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the [[municipality]] tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately £900, $1,150, or [[€]]1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income related compensation that otherwise exceeds the ceiling of the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.

==Saudi Arabia==
[[Saudi Arabia]] is an economic [[welfare state]] with free medical care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&amp;InNewsItemID=1746|title=Request Rejected|website=www.mofa.gov.sa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unemployment benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm|title=Social Services (2) - SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource)|website=saudinf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the country relies not on taxation but mainly [[oil]] revenues to maintain the social and economic services to its populace.

Payment:
2000 SAR (USD $534) for only 12 months for unemployed person from ages 18–35

==Turkey==
By law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment. the benefit payment is 50% for the average daily earnings based on the last 4 months and cannot be higher than the mimimum wage (per industry). Benefits may be paid for a max of 1,080 days depending on the number of contributions. some are skeptical of how well the system is functioning in turkey&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justlanded.com/english/Turkey/Turkey-Guide/Jobs/Social-security-in-Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jobseeker's Allowance rates===
JSA for a single person is changed annually, and at 3 August 2012 the maximum payable was [[£]]71.00 per week for a person aged over 25 and £56.25 per week for a person aged 18–24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobseeker's Allowance|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_200090.html|publisher=Directgov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for couples where both are unemployed are more complex, but a maximum of £112.55 per week is payable, dependent on age and other factors. Income-based JSA is reduced for people with savings of over £6,000, by a reduction of £1 per week per £250 of savings, up to £16,000. People with savings of over £16,000 are not able to get IB-JSA at all.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Benefit &amp; Tax Credit Rates 2006 — © [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] (United Kingdom) and the [[Child Poverty Action Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; The British system provides rent payments as part of a separate scheme called [[Housing Benefit]].

Unemployment benefit is commonly referred to as "the dole"; to receive the benefit is to be "on the dole". "Dole" here is an archaic expression meaning "one's allotted portion", from the synonymous [[Old English]] word ''dāl''.

==United States==
[[File:Unemployment rate map of the united states.gif|300px|thumb|right|Unemployment rate by county from January 1990 - March 2017]]
In the United States, there are 50 state unemployment insurance programs plus one each in the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]]. Though policies vary by state, unemployment benefits generally pay eligible workers as high as $783.00 per week in the [[Massachusetts]] to a low as $235 per week maximum in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutunemployment.org/faqs/best-and-worst-states-for-unemployment-benefits/|title=Best and Worst States for Unemployment Benefits - 2017 {{!}} AboutUnemployment.org|website=aboutunemployment.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes levied against employers, to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of their own. Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct ("terminated for cause") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-wrongful-termination-2061658|title=How to Handle a Wrongful Termination|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In every state, employees who quit their job without "good cause" are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the definition of good cause varies by state. In some states, being fired for misconduct permanently bars the employee from receiving unemployment benefits, while in others it only disqualifies the employee for a short period. This compensation is classified as a type of social welfare benefit. According to the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these types of benefits are to be included in a taxpayer's gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tax Topics - Topic 418 Unemployment Compensation |work=Internal Revenue Service |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc418.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard time-length of unemployment compensation is six months, although extensions are possible during economic downturns. During the [[Great Recession]], unemployment benefits were extended to 73 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-long-unemployment-benefits-now-last-in-each-state-2014-1|title=Here's How Long Unemployment Benefits Now Last In Each State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court held that federal unemployment law is constitutional and does not violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] in ''[[Steward Machine Company v. Davis]]'', [[Case citation|301 U.S. 548]] (1937).

===Federal-state joint programs===

Unemployment insurance is a federal-state program financed through federal and state payroll taxes (federal and state UI taxes).&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uitaxtopic.asp|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Topic, Employment &amp; Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=workforcesecurity.doleta.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most states employers pay state and federal unemployment taxes if:

:(1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500 or more in any quarter of a calendar year; or,&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;
:(2) they had at least one employee during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether the weeks were consecutive. Some state laws differ from the federal law.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;

To facilitate this program, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]] (FUTA), which authorizes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits which are triggered in periods of high state unemployment. FUTA also provides a fund from which states UI funds may borrow to pay benefits. As originally established, the states paid the federal government.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;

The FUTA tax rate was originally three percent of taxable wages collected from employers who employed at least four employees,&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 182"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph  F. |title= ''State and Local Government''|year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |isbn= | pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employers could deduct up to 90 percent of the amount due if they paid taxes to a state to support a system of unemployment insurance which met Federal standards,&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 213"/&gt; but the rules have recently changed. The FUTA tax rate is now, as of 30 June 2011, 6.0 percent of taxable wages of employees who meet both the above and following criteria,&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; and the taxable wage base is the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; Employers who pay the state unemployment tax on time receive an offset credit of up to 5.4 percent regardless of the rate of tax they pay their state. Therefore, the net FUTA tax rate is generally 0.6 percent (6.0 percent - 5.4 percent), for a maximum FUTA tax of $42.00 per employee, per year (.006 X $7,000 = $42.00). State law determines individual state unemployment insurance tax rates.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; In the United States, unemployment insurance tax rates use [[experience rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/lavape/9615.html|title=Unemployment Insurance Experience Rating of Firms and Layoffs|first1=P. Y.|last1=Cremieux|first2=M.|last2=Van Audenrode|date=6 May 1996|publisher=|via=ideas.repec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the taxable wage base for each state/territory is at least $7,000 as mandated by FUTA, only four states or territories still remain at this minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanpayroll.org/members/stateui/state-ui-2/|title=State Unemployment Wage Bases|website=www.americanpayroll.org|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states/territories include Arizona, California, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Florida and Puerto Rico maintain tax rates similar to those of other states, but Arizona and California both have a higher maximum tax rate. Florida's minimum tax rate is 0.1% and the state maximum is 5.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://floridarevenue.com/dor/taxes/reemployment.html#who|title=FL Dept Rev - Reemployment Tax|website=floridarevenue.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Puerto Rico, employers are taxed between 2.4% and 5.4% depending on their experience rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.payroll-taxes.com/state-tax/puerto-rico|title=Puerto Rico State Tax Information {{!}} Payroll Taxes|last=igor@platon.sk|first=Igor Mino,|website=www.payroll-taxes.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Arizona's minimum was 0.03%, but its maximum was 7.79%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://des.az.gov/sites/default/files/ui_tax_rate_chart.pdf|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Rates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Arizona Department of Economic Security|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; California's tax rate on the taxable wage base is currently higher than the federal minimum of 6.0%. Employers are currently on a tax schedule that requires them to pay a minimum of 1.5% and a maximum 6.2% of the taxable wage base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Payroll_Taxes/Rates_and_Withholding.htm|title=Rates and Withholding|last=Department|first=Employment Development|website=www.edd.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the federal tax credit of 5.4%, Arizona employers could end up paying $175 per employee ((.0779-.054) x $7,000) and California employers could pay $56 per employee ((.062-.054) x $7,000) versus the FUTA maximum of $42.

Within the above constraints, the individual [[U.S. state|states]] and territories raise their own contributions and run their own programs. The federal government sets broad guidelines for coverage and eligibility, but states vary in how they determine benefits and eligibility.

Federal rules are drawn by the [[United States Department of Labor]], Employment and Training Administration. For most states, the maximum period for receiving benefits is 26 weeks. There is an extended benefit program (authorized through the Social Security Acts) that may be triggered by the state unemployment rate. Congress has often passed temporary programs to extend benefits during recessions. This was done with the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program in 2002-2003, which has since expired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation |work=Employment &amp; Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/factsheetteuc.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in force through 2 June 2010, with the Extended Unemployment Compensation 2008 legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC) Program |work=Employment &amp; Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, legislation that provides an extension of federal extended unemployment benefits through November 2010 was signed by the president. The legislation extended benefits for 2.3 million unemployed workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits.

The federal government lends money to the states for unemployment insurance when states run short of funds which happens when the state's UI fund cannot cover the cost of current benefits. A high unemployment rate shrinks UI tax revenues and increases expenditures on benefits. State UI finances and the need for loans are exacerbated when a state cuts taxes and increases benefits. FUTA loans to state funds are repaid with interest.

Congressional actions to increase penalties for states incurring large debts for unemployment benefits led to state fiscal crises in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

One interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data |work=SSRN Repository |publisher=Working Paper |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3062412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroeconomic function ===
To Keynesians, unemployment insurance acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1999/199964/199964pap.pdf |last1= Cohen| first1= Darrel| first2= Glenn| last2= Follette| title= The Automatic Fiscal Stabilizers: Quietly Doing Their Thing| location= Washington, DC| publisher= Divisions of Research &amp; Statistics and Monetary Affairs, [[Federal Reserve Board]]| year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Eligibility and amount ===
In order to receive benefits, a person must have worked for at least one quarter in the previous year and have been laid-off by an employer. Workers who were temporary or were paid under the table are not eligible for unemployment insurance. If a worker quits without good cause or is fired for misconduct, then they are normally not eligible for UI benefits. There are five common reasons a claim for unemployment benefits are denied: the worker is unavailable for work, the worker quit his or her job without good cause, the worker was fired for misconduct, refusing suitable work, and unemployment resulting from a labor dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployed Without Benefits: A Couple's Struggle |first=Kathy |last=Lohr |work=National Public Radio |date=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99170822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://utahstaffingcompanies.com/helpful-tips-for-employers/unemployment-benefits-eligibility/&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it is only practical to verify whether the worker quit or was fired. If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.&lt;ref name="ctdol.state.ct.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/progsupt/unemplt/new-faqui.htm|title=Unemployment Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|first=State of Connecticut Department of|last=Labor|website=www.ctdol.state.ct.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause.

Generally, the worker must be unemployed through no fault of his/her own although workers often file for benefits they are not entitled to; when the employer demonstrates that the unemployed person quit or was fired for cause the worker is required to pay back the benefits they received. The unemployed person must also meet state requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time (referred to as a “base period”) to be eligible for benefits. In most states, the base period is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that the claim is filed.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"&gt;[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uifactsheet.asp State Unemployment Benefits] ''US Department of Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment benefits are based on reported covered quarterly earnings. The amount of earnings and the number of quarters worked are used to determine the length and value of the unemployment benefit. The average weekly in 2010 payment was $293.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/08/AR2010030804927.html|title=Are unemployment benefits no longer temporary?|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|date=9 March 2010|work=The Washington Post|last2=Hedgpeth|first2=Dana|access-date=2016-09-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] passed in February 2009, many unemployed people receive up to [[99ers|99 weeks]] of unemployment benefits; this may depend on State legislation. Before the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the maximum number of weeks allowed was 26.

=== Application process ===
It generally takes two weeks for benefit payments to begin, the first being a "waiting week", which is not reimbursed, and the second being the time lag between eligibility for the program and the first benefit actually being paid.

To begin a claim, the unemployed worker must apply for benefits through a state unemployment agency.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"/&gt; In certain instances, the employer initiates the process. Generally, the certification includes the affected person affirming that they are "able and available for work", the amount of any part-time earnings they may have had, and whether they are actively seeking work. These certifications are usually accomplished either over the Internet or via an interactive voice response telephone call, but in a few states may be by mail. After receiving an application, the state will notify the individual if they qualify and the rate they will receive every week. The state will also review the reason for separation from employment. Many states require the individual to periodically certify that the conditions of the benefits are still met.

=== Disqualification/Appeals ===

If a worker's reason for separation from their last job is due to some reason other than a "lack of work," a determination will be made about whether they are eligible for benefits. Generally, all determinations of eligibility for benefits are made by the appropriate State under its law or applicable federal laws. If a worker is disqualified or denied benefits, they have the right to file an appeal within an established time-frame. The State will advise a worker of his or her appeal rights. An employer may also appeal a determination if they do not agree with the State's determination regarding the employee's eligibility.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"/&gt; If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove substantially that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.&lt;ref name="ctdol.state.ct.us"/&gt; However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause. Success rate of unemployment appeals is two-thirds, or 67% of the time for the most claimants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workforce.com/articles/penny-wise-pound-foolish-on-unemployment-challenges

===Measurement===

==== Current data ====
Each Thursday, the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] issues the ''Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm|title=ETA Press Release: Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report|website=www.dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headline number is the seasonally adjusted estimate for the initial claims for unemployment for the previous week in the United States. This statistic, because it is published weekly, is depended on as a current indicator of the labor market and the economy generally.

In 2016, the number of people on unemployment benefits fell to around 1.74 the lowest in the last 4 decades.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_29795570/us-applications-jobless-aid-fall-four-decade-low?source=JPopUp|title=US applications for jobless aid fall to four-decade low|author=Josh Boak|date=21 April 2016|publisher=[[Denver Post]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment insurance outlook ====
Twice a year, the Office of Management and Budget delivers an economic assessment of the unemployment insurance program as it relates to budgetary issues.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"&gt;[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/content/prez_budget.asp UI Outlook: Overview] ''US Department of Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; As it relates to the FY 2012 budget, the OMB reports that the insured unemployment rate (IUR) is projected to average 3.6% in both FY 2011 and in FY 2012. State unemployment regular benefit outlays are estimated at $61 billion in FY 2011 and $64.3 billion in FY 2012, down somewhat from Midsession estimates.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $16.0 billion in FY 2011 and $15.1 billion in FY 2012.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; State trust fund account balances, net of loans, are projected to continue to fall, from -$27.4 billion at the end of FY 2010 to -$62.7 billion at the end of FY 2013, before starting to grow again.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; 

Net balances are not projected to become positive again until well beyond FY 2016. Up to 40 states are projected to continue borrowing heavily from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) over the next few years.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; The aggregate loan balance is projected to increase from $40.2 billion at the end of FY 2010 to a peak end-of-year balance of $68.3 billion in FY 2013. Due to the high volume of state loans and increased EB payments, FUA and EUCA are projected to borrow $26.7 billion from the general fund in FY 2011 and an additional $19.4 billion in FY 2012, with neither account projected to return to a net positive balance before 2016.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; The general fund advances must be repaid with interest.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt;

===Economic rationale and issues===
The economic argument for unemployment insurance comes from the principle of [[adverse selection]]. One common criticism of unemployment insurance is that it induces [[moral hazard]], the fact that unemployment insurance lowers on-the-job effort and reduces job-search effort.

====Adverse selection====
[[Adverse selection]] refers to the fact that “workers who have the highest probability of becoming unemployed have the highest demand for unemployment insurance.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Public Finance''|last=Rosen|first=Harvey S.|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-351128-3|location=New York, New York|pages=292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse selection causes profit maximizing private insurance agencies to set high premiums for the insurance because there is a high likelihood they will have to make payments to the policyholder. High premiums work to exclude many individuals who otherwise might purchase the insurance. “A compulsory government program avoids the adverse selection problem. Hence, government provision of UI has the potential to increase efficiency. However, government provision does not eliminate moral hazard.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt;

====Moral hazard====
“At the same time, those workers who managed to obtain insurance might experience more unemployment otherwise would have been the case.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt; The private insurance company would have to determine whether the employee is unemployed through no fault of their own, which is difficult to determine. Incorrect determinations could result in the payout of significant amounts for fraudulent claims or alternately failure to pay legitimate claims. This leads to the rationale that if government could solve either problem that government intervention would increase efficiency.

====Unemployment insurance effect on unemployment====
In the [[Great Recession]], the “moral hazard” issue of whether unemployment insurance—and specifically extending benefits past the maximum 99 weeks—significantly encourages unemployment by discouraging workers from finding and taking jobs was expressed by Republican legislators. Conservative economist Robert Barro found that benefits raised the unemployment rate 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barro, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703959704575454431457720188 "The Folly of Subsidizing Unemployment"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 30 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt; Disagreeing with Barro's study were Berkeley economist [[Jesse Rothstein]], who found the “vast majority” of unemployment was due to “demand shocks” not “[unemployment insurance]-induced supply reductions.”&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/97971/would-extending-unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment Would Extending Unemployment Benefits Increase Unemployment?]. Simon van Zuylen-Wood.  30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/2011_fall_bpea_papers/2011_fall_bpea_conference_rothstein.pdf Unemployment Insurance and Job Search in the Great Recession. Jesse Rothstein] 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Rothstein of extensions of unemployment insurance to 99 weeks during [[2008–2012 global recession|the Great Recession]] to test the hypothesis that unemployment insurance discourages people from seeking jobs found the overall effect of UI on unemployment was to raise it by no more than one-tenth of one percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/103034/romney-economic-agenda-jobs-taxes-regulation-campaign The Blind Spot in Romney's Economic Plan] Jonathan Cohn| tnr.com| 29 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jesse |last=Rothstein |year=2011 |title=Unemployment Insrance and Job Search in the Great Recession |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=143–213 |jstor=41473599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2011 report by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that even if unemployment benefits convince some unemployed to ignore job openings, these openings were quickly filled by new entrants into the labor market.&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12437/11-15-Outlook_Stimulus_Testimony.pdf Policies for Increasing Economic Growth and Employment] cbo.gov 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of studies on unemployment insurance's effect on employment by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who ''didn’t'' have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/10dbb94dafa96d904bcaf546ee3b02a2/publication/456/ Unemployment Benefits and Work Incentives: The U.S. Labor Market in the Great Recession (revised), Howell, David R.; Azizoglu, Bert M.; [[Political Economy Research Institute]], 21 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern over unemployment insurance increasing unemployment is based on experience rating benefit uses which can sometimes be imperfect. That is, the cost to the employer in increased taxes is less than the benefits that would be paid to the employee upon layoff. The firm in this instance believes that it is more cost effective to lay off the employee, causing more unemployment than under perfect experience rating.&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt;

====Unemployment insurance effect on employment====
An alternative rationale for unemployment insurance is that it may allow for improving the quality of matches between workers and firms. Marimon and Zilibotti argued that although a more generous unemployment benefit system may indeed increase the unemployment rate, it may also help improve the average match quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00432 | volume=109 | issue=455 | title=Unemployment vs. Mismatch of Talents: Reconsidering Unemployment Benefits | year=1999 | journal=The Economic Journal | pages=266–291 | last1 = Marimon | first1 = Ramon | subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point is made by Mazur who analyzed the welfare and inequality effects of a policy reform giving entitlement for unemployment insurance to quitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |subscription=y |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.07.001 |title=Can welfare abuse be welfare improving? |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=141 |pages=11 |year=2016 |last1=Mazur |first1=Karol }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber present empirical evidence from Austria that extending unemployment benefit duration raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.20150528 | subscription=y | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=Does Extending Unemployment Benefits Improve Job Quality? | year=2017 | journal=American Economic Review | pages=527–561 | last1 = Nekoei | first1 = Arash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tatsiramos studied data from European countries and found that although unemployment insurance does increase unemployment duration, the duration of subsequent employment tends to be longer (suggesting better match quality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.6.1225 | volume=7 | issue=6 | title=Unemployment Insurance in Europe: Unemployment Duration and Subsequent Employment Stability | year=2009 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=1225–1260 | last1 = Tatsiramos | first1 = Konstantinos| subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative policy====
An alternative to unemployment insurance intended to reduce the moral hazard costs would introduce mandated individual saving accounts for workers to draw on after being laid off. The plan, by [[Martin Feldstein]] would pay any positive account balance at retirement to the employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Feldstein |first1= Martin |year=2005 |title= Rethinking Social Insurance |journal=  NBER Working Papers 11250 |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc }}   Feldstein finds that the costs, loans to individuals when funds are exhausted and the forgiveness of negative account balances at retirement, of this program to the government would be less than the current unemployment insurance program.  The benefits of the program include providing the same level of protection to the unemployed while correcting some of the [[moral hazard]] problem {{cite journal |last1= Feldstein |first1= Martin |last2= Altman |first2= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts |journal= NBER Working Paper Series |volume= 6860 |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect on state budgets ====
Another issue with unemployment insurance relates to its effects on state budgets. During recessionary time periods, the number of unemployed rises and they begin to draw benefits from the program. The longer the recession lasts, depending on the state's starting UI program balance, the quicker the state begins to run out of funds. The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 has significantly impacted state budgets. According to The Council of State Governments, by 18 March 2011, 32 states plus the Virgin Islands had borrowed nearly $45.7 billion. The Labor Department estimates by the fourth quarter of 2013, as many as 40 states may need to borrow more than $90 billion to fund their unemployment programs and it will take a decade or more to pay off the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/content/state-unemployment-insurance-trust-funds-march-2011-update Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds Update] ''Council of State Governments''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance funds====
Possible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses. Kentucky took the approach of raising taxes and lowering benefits to attempt to balance its unemployment insurance program. Starting in 2010, a claimant's weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from $8,000 to $12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over $450 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://migration.kentucky.gov/Newsroom/governor/20100615unempins.htm] ''Kentucky.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxing or exempting benefits====
The argument for taxation of [[social welfare]] benefits is that they result in a realized gain for a taxpayer. The argument against taxation is that the benefits are generally less than the [[federal poverty level]].

Unemployment compensation has been taxable by the federal government since 1987.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott, Christine |title=Taxation of Unemployment Benefits: Report for Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress |work=Cornell University ILR School |date=14 January 2005 |format=PDF |url= http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1224&amp;context=key_workplace }}&lt;/ref&gt; Code Section 85 deemed unemployment compensation included in gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/85- |title=Section 85 |work=Internal Revenue Service |publisher=Cornell University Law School }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal taxes are not withheld from unemployment compensation at the time of payment unless requested by the recipient using [[Form W-4#Filing|Form W-4V]].&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voluntary Withholding Request |work=Internal Revenue Service |date=August 2006 |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4v.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, Rep. [[Phil English|Philip English]] introduced legislation to repeal the taxation of unemployment compensation, but the legislation did not advance past [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|committee]].&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 798 (108th): Unemployment Tax Repeal Act of 2003 |work=United States Congress |publisher=govtrack.us |date=13 February 2003 |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states with income tax consider unemployment compensation to be taxable.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
Prior to 1987, unemployment compensation amounts were excluded from federal gross income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxlinks.com/rulings/1971/revrul71-425.htm "Revenue Ruling 71-425"]. ''Internal Revenue Service''. Taxlinks.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the US Federal [[tax year]] of 2009, as a result of the signing of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] signed by [[Barack Obama]] on 17 February 2009 the first $2,400 worth of unemployment income received during the 'tax year' of 2009 will be exempted from being considered as taxable income on the Federal level, when American taxpayers file their 2009 IRS tax return paperwork in early 2010.

===Job sharing / short-time working===
[[Job sharing]] or work sharing and [[short time]] or short-time working refer to situations or systems in which employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in working time and pay. These can be based on individual agreements or on government programs in many countries that try to prevent unemployment. In these, employers have the option of reducing work hours to part-time for many employees instead of laying off some of them and retaining only full-time workers. For example, employees in 18 states of the United States can then receive unemployment payments for the hours they are no longer working.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93581221 Companies Implement Part-Time Layoffs] by Curt Nickisch. Morning Edition, National Public Radio.  21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment through prepaid debit cards===
In 2013, it was reported that most U.S. states deliver unemployment benefits to [[unbanked|recipients who do not have a bank account]] through a [[prepaid debit card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nclc.org/issues/unemployment-compensation-prepaid-cards.html 2013 Survey of Unemployment Compensation Prepaid Cards] ''©National Consumer Law Center''&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government uses the Direct Express Debit [[Mastercard]] [[prepaid debit card]] offered by Mastercard and [[Comerica Bank]] to give some federal assistance payments to people who do not have bank accounts. Many states have similar programs for unemployment payments and other assistance.

==International Labour Convention==
[[International Labour Organization]] has adopted the [[Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988]] for promotion of [[employment]] against unemployment and [[social security]] including unemployment benefit.

'''Venture Café''' is a nonprofit hosting community-focused events and programs which support early-stage entrepreneurs.

There are currently eight Venture Cafés in cities across the Midwest, South, and Northeastern regions of the United States, and in Tokyo, Japan, and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Each Venture Café is independently managed and runs the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. Recently, Venture Café Providence recently was announced through a partnership with the city of Providence.&lt;ref name="wpri-vencaf"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/mayor-elorza-nonprofit-leaders-launch-innovation-partnership/1432204478 | first=Dan | last=McGowan | date=10 September 2018 | accessdate=5 October 2018 | title=Mayor Elorza, nonprofit leaders launch innovation partnership }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Venture Café Boston ==

The Venture Café was originally conceived as a restaurant located in the CIC in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe-hottest"&gt;{{cite web |title=How a failed restaurant became Cambridge’s hottest Thursday spot|work=Boston Globe |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/06/21/this-could-hottest-place-town-thursday-night-and-beer-free/so61lJpjP7HcZLXTCEGvcK/story.html|first=Scott|last=Kirsner|date= 21 June 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant failed to attract investment and was reimagined as a gathering for the entrepreneurial community based on the book Venture Café by Teresa Esser.&lt;ref name="venture-name"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venture Café’s mission is connecting innovators to make things happen.|work=Venture Cafe Official Website |url=http://venturecafeglobal.org/about/|date= 24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venture Café Kendall launched in 2009 bringing together hundreds of entrepreneurs each week for the flagship program, the Thursday Gathering. 

== Venture Café St. Louis ==

In 2014, Venture Café expanded to the [[Cortex Innovation Community]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, to bring together the emerging startup community.&lt;ref name="stltoday-cambridge"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Innovation Center opens at Cortex|work=St. Louis Post Dispatch |url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/building-blocks/cambridge-innovation-center-opens-at-cortex/article_202c0df4-dbbb-567e-aec8-32ee0a9eff35.html|first=Tim|last=Bryant|date= Sep 29, 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the St. Louis location prompted the launch of Venture Cafés in other cities and ultimately the creation of Venture Café Global Institute, a public benefit corporation based in both St. Louis and Boston.&lt;ref name="silicon-venture"&gt;{{cite web |title=T-REX and Venture Cafe STL are changing St. Louis’ startup landscape|work=Silicon Prairie News |url=http://siliconprairienews.com/2018/03/t-rex-venture-cafe-changing-st-louis-startup-landscape/|first=Christine|last=McGuigan|date=2 March 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the City of Boston and Venture Café Kendall opened District Hall, a free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs, including an event venue, restaurant and coffee shop. In 2018, as part of St. Louis Cortex District's new 4220 Duncan building anchored by Microsoft, Venture Cafe launches Innovation Hall in St. Louis based upon Boston's District Hall.&lt;ref name="nextstl-innovationhall"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cortex Unveils New 4220 Duncan Building|work=NextSTL |url=https://nextstl.com/2018/05/cortex-unveils-new-4220-duncan-building/|first=Jason |last=Deem |date=10 May 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The St. Louis location will also be the first to launch the Education Hub, also known as EdHub STL, a program supporting and bringing together innovators in education to benefit youth access to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venture Cafe St. Louis To Open Innovation Hall At Cortex|url=http://eqstl.com/venture-cafe-st-louis-open-innovation-hall-cortex/|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; EdHub STL is inspired by the Forward Through Ferguson report which calls for an innovation education hub to address the region's most entrenched educational issues.&lt;ref name="fwdthruferguson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Create an Innovative Education Hub|work=Forward Through Ferguson |url=https://forwardthroughferguson.org/calls-to-action/innovative-education-hub/|date= 24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
=== Thursday Gathering ===
The flagship program of Venture Café, is the Thursday Gathering, a weekly, community-focused event that provides opportunities for new and experienced entrepreneurs the ability to exchange ideas and support. The Thursday Gathering includes several free educational sessions aimed at entrepreneurs to learn how to start and run a business. The Gatherings are intentionally informal allowing for more opportunity to engage in creative and speculative ideas and look for collaborators, co-founders, mentors, or investors.&lt;ref name="venture-name" /&gt;

=== Civic Innovation Centers ===
Venture Cafés in St. Louis, Boston, and Philadelphia currently offer free drop-in workspace for entrepreneurs to work and collaborate in addition to paid event and meeting rooms and restaurants and coffeeshops.

=== Education ===
Venture Café Foundation in Boston currently runs the Roxbury Innovation Center and St. Louis is launching EdHub STL in 2018.&lt;ref name="bizjournal-cortex"&gt;{{cite web |title='Innovation center,' restaurant to open at Cortex|work=St. Louis Business Journal |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2018/04/11/innovation-center-restaurant-to-open-at-cortex.html|date= 11 April 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018| first=Steph |last=Kukuljan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both programs focus on bringing together innovators in education including students, parents, administration, and teachers to help solve inequities in education and introduce youth to entrepreneurship and STEAM activities.

=== Café Nights ===
Café Nights are monthly or quarterly versions of the Thursday Gathering located outside the weekly event.

From 1991 to 1993 he served in the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name=ассоциация&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alrf.ru/blog/html5-blank/gruzdev-vladimir-sergeevich/|title=Груздев Владимир Сергеевич|date=|publisher=Ассоциация юристов России|accessdate=2017-04-08}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he graduated from the Faculty of Law of [[Moscow State University]], majoring in Legal studies.

=== Entrepreneurship ===
In 1993, after quitting the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia, together with his partners he established the trading company "[[Sedmoi Kontinent|The Seventh Continent]]", where he worked at executive positions from 1994 to 2001.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|title= 200 богатейших бизнесменов России: Владимир Груздев|url=http://www.forbes.ru/profile/vladimir-gruzdev |date=2017-04-20|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he entered the Russian rating of [[Forbes]] magazine with net worth of 0.34 billion dollars (89th place) for the first time. In 2014, his fortune reached a peak of $1.3 billion, which allowed Gruzdev to take 79th place in the ranking. As of 2016, he held 147th place in the Russian rating of Forbes magazine with a fortune of 0.55 billion dollars.&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt;

In 2007, Gruzdev sold his stake in "The Seventh Continent" to partner Alexander Zanadvorov for about $1 billion, explaining that political career was the priority for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Владимир Груздев продал долю в «Седьмом континенте» и строит жилье|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2010/10/13/semerka_bez_gruzdeva|date=2010-10-13|publisher=Ведомости}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political activity ===
==== Moscow City Duma ====

In 2001, Vladimir Gruzdev won the election to the [[Moscow City Duma]] in the 27th district, gaining 53.17% of the vote. 

During the period of work in the city parliament, he managed the working group on the personnel policy of the courts of Moscow. He was a member of several commissions of the Duma: budget and financial, legislative and security, entrepreneurship, education, as well as a joint commission of the Moscow City Duma and the Moscow Government on the regulatory basis of land and property relations.

==== The State Duma ====
In December 2003, Vladimir Gruzdev was elected a deputy of the [[State Duma]] of the [[4th State Duma of the Russian Federation|IV convocation]] for the Chertanovo single-mandate constituency, having received at the elections 149069 (53.3%) votes.

In December 2007 he was elected to the State Duma of the fifth convocation from Moscow. He was the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Civil, Criminal, Arbitration and Procedural Legislation.

In the summer of 2007, Vladimir Gruzdev acted as a participant (and, according to some sources, a sponsor) of the expedition of the scientific vessel ''[[Akademik Fyodorov]]'' to the North Pole. During the expedition Gruzdev dived at the [[North Pole]] point on the Mir-1 bathyscaphe and installed a titanium flag of Russia and a capsule with a "message to future generations" at the seabed.

In September 2011, Vladimir Gruzdev was included number two (after [[Boris Gryzlov]]) into the list of candidates from "United Russia" in the Tula region. On December 4, 2011 elections to the State Duma of the sixth convocation took place, as a result "United Russia" received 61% of the vote in the Tula region. Gruzdev refused the deputy's mandate.

On July 29, 2011, he was appointed as provisional governor of the [[Tula region]].

On August 18, 2011 the official ceremony of Vladimir Gruzdev's inauguration was held in the Tula Kremlin.

In his work as head of the region, Vladimir Gruzdev mostly relied on loyal but inexperienced staff from Moscow. He was famous for rough and aggressive style of management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Николай Орлов|title=Мищенко – птенец гнезда Груздева|url=http://www.ng.ru/regions/2017-02-21/100_mishenko210217.html|date=2017-02-21|publisher=Независимая газета}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artemiev"&gt;{{cite web|author=Максим Артемьев|title=Вовремя ушел: чем запомнился губернатор Владимир Груздев|url=http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya-column/vertikal/311861-vovremya-ushel-chem-zapomnilsya-gubernator-vladimir-gruzdev|date=2016-02-03|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the presence of many people, he suggested that the mayor of the city of [[Bogoroditsk]] shot himself.&lt;ref name="artemiev" /&gt; On August 13, 2014, Vladimir Gruzdev appointed the former State Duma member of the fifth convocation and ex-leader of the [[Young Russia (youth movement)|Young Russia]] movement [[Maksim Mishchenko]] to the post of deputy head of the government office of the Tula region under the Government of the Russian Federation and deputy minister of internal policy and local government development of the Tula region.&lt;ref name="ЪВ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloha.info/view/articles/1020655/ Зам. министра Максим Мищенко: от нациков до педиков.

During his service as a governor Gruzdev donated money for the restoration of one of the bells for the bell tower of the Assumption Cathedral of the Tula Kremlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Состоялось освящение колоколов, отлитых для колокольни Успенского собора Тульского кремля  l|url=https://regnum.ru/news/cultura/1707619.html|date=2013-09-14|publisher=ИА REGNUM}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also personally spent 250 million rubles on charity annually in the Tula region, and transferred his entire salary to Yasnaya Polyana children's home.&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt; Since December 2012 the governor's salary in the amount of 48,115 rubles was transferred to the fund of the Tula Kremlin and for the organization of disabled people.

There was also a version according to which during the governorship Gruzdev violated the law and continued to engage in entrepreneurial activities and took direct part in the management of the company "Modny Continent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Суд: в период губернаторства в Тульской области Владимир Груздев контролировал «Модный континент»|url=http://newstula.ru/fn_240041.html |date=2016-12-20|publisher=Тульские новости}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloha.info/view/articles/1031901/ История с грантами в 3 млрд руб в Туле напоминает «лихие 90-ые».

==== The Association of Lawyers of Russia ====
On December 3, 2016 the congress of the Association of Lawyers of Russia unanimously elected Vladimir Gruzdev to be the chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Владимир Груздев избран председателем правления Ассоциации юристов России|url=http://www.newstula.ru/fn_236153.html|date=2016-12-03|publisher=Тульские новости}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March and April 2017, Gruzdev held meetings with the Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky (cooperation between the Association and the Russian Military Historical Society was discussed) and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Владимир Груздев и Владимир Мединский обсудили вопросы сотрудничества между Ассоциацией юристов России и Российским военно-историческим обществом|url=http://rvio.histrf.ru/activities/news/item-3277|date=2017-03-15|publisher=Российское военно-историческое общество}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Дмитрий Медведев встретился с руководителями Ассоциации юристов России|url=http://www.mk.ru/social/2017/04/06/dmitriy-medvedev-vstretilsya-s-rukovoditelyami-associacii-yuristov-rossii.html|date=2017-04-06|publisher=MK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific activity ==
In 2003, Gruzdev defended his thesis on "Legal status of civil servants of the Russian Federation and organizational and legal bases for the functioning of the system of training, retraining and advanced training" at the Department of Administrative Law of the Moscow University of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 2013, the [[Dissernet]] community found that the whole content of the work was plagiarism: 168 of 182 pages were entirely copied from the original work of Pavel Vostrikov "Organizational and legal problems of training, retraining and upgrading of civil servants", defended in 1998.&lt;ref name=плагиат&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ru/society/11/06/2013/57040a3d9a7947fcbd449fbc |title=В диссертации тульского губернатора В.

== Estimates of fortune ==
Gruzdev has been regularly included in the rating of the magazine Forbes since 2005, with the exception of 2008. He took positions from 36 (2009) to 135 (2017). The biggest fortune was reached in 2010 - 950 million dollars.

In 2011, with the same fortune he took 104th place. In 2012, he took the first place in the ranking of the richest Russian officials with an income of 3.89 billion rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myslo.ru/news/tula/2015-05-15-forbes-sostoyanie-vladimira-gruzdeva-otsenivaetsya-v-1-2-mlrd-dollarov|title=Forbes составил список губернаторов-миллиардеров по всему миру|date=2015-05-15|publisher=MySlo|accessdate=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the declaration which Gruzdev submitted in 2011 as an official, it is known that he had deposits in banks amounting to 9.4 billion rubles. He also owned shares in OJSC [[Bank Saint Petersburg]], OJSC [[VTB Bank]] and [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref name="slon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slon.ru/russia/zoloto_partiy_gosduma_2011-712795.xhtml?dep=709629|title=Золото партий.
